1,"The end of the nineteenth century marked a significant shift in politics, where political figures had to adapt to the changing landscape of media attention. This shift not only paved the way for the rise of figures like Cecil Rhodes but also laid the foundation for the subsequent criticism of his cult and its association with racism in recent times.

Why did newspapers across different countries give so much attention, and consequently legitimacy, to Rhodes, who with the raid had embarrassed the British government and angered the international public, and who no longer occupied any official position? While there is a vast literature on Rhodes, this meeting is often mentioned merely in passing, if at all. This neglect is striking, given that the press heralded it as the political rehabilitation of Rhodes, an improvement in the troubled Anglo-German relationship, and a general transformation in international affairs.

Moreover, the meeting had a long-term influence on strengthening Anglo-German ties, as it was most likely the reason why Rhodes selected Germany to be the third power, alongside Britain and the United States, whose nationals would be eligible for the prestigious Rhodes Scholarships at the University of Oxford. This demonstrates the significant impact of Rhodes's Cape-to-Cairo negotiations on fostering international cooperation and academic exchange.","P.

This decision had far-reaching consequences, but even more significant is the insight it provides into the workings of politics in the emerging transnational public sphere of the late nineteenth century. [CITATION-8] Paul Maylam's analysis of the 'cult of Rhodes' demonstrates the lasting impact of Rhodes's legacy through various mediums such as hagiographies, monuments, memorials, universities, novels, and films. These efforts laid the groundwork for the international 'Rhodes phenomenon'.","On this new transnational public sphere, see also B. van Waarden, ʻDemands of a Transnational Public Sphere: The Diplomatic Conflict between Joseph Chamberlain and Bernhard von Bülow and how the Mass Press Shaped Expectations for Mediatized Politics around the Turn of the Twentieth Centuryʼ, European Review of History/Revue européenne d’histoire, xxvi (2019), pp. 476–504.",1

However, even more significant than these concrete outcomes is what Rhodes’s Cape-to-Cairo negotiations reveal about how politics operated within a new transnational public sphere in the closing decade of the nineteenth century. Paul Maylam has analysed the ‘cult of Rhodes’ that developed over the century after Rhodes’s death, through hagiographies, monuments, memorials, universities, novels and films—the precondition for the international ‘Rhodes Must Fall’ movement against racism of recent decades. Yet we are still left with questions about how the public image of Rhodes initially emerged and functioned during his lifetime, and what the role of the expanding mass. 

In my opinion, the international 'Rhodes Must Fall' movement is a necessary response to the glorification of an imperialist figure like Rhodes, as highlighted by P.

Rhodes had no official standing.[CITATION-45] However, the hyped press coverage of Rhodes created the impression that he was a British minister.

However, a different account is offered by the former first secretary of the German embassy in London, Baron Hermann von Eckardstein.

He began as attaché and in December 1899 was appointed first secretary, after which he played an important role in embassy affairs, owing to the illness and old age of the ambassador. It seems that during the Rhodes–Wilhelm II episode, Eckardstein temporarily functioned as an independent legation councillor, but he still seemed to be involved closely enough in German foreign policy to have a good understanding of ongoing events.

Rhodes and Wilhelm II were constantly described as ‘men of business’, who were ‘frank’, ‘straightforward’ and liked to ‘take the bull by the horns’.[CITATION-115] Of course, Rhodes was primarily a businessman, and in the narrow sense the Cape-to-Cairo projects were business ventures, but newspapers saw the negotiations within a broader political context and believed that the swift and decisive actions of Rhodes and Wilhelm II were necessary for progress and success.

116,"Even in describing Rhodes’s dealings with governments, the language of business was employed: ‘Having got his terms from the King of the Belgians, he negotiated with Brussels for his favours. He is received not merely as Sovereigns and statesmen receive an English Privy Councillor, but as a business partner with whom profitable business may be done’ (emphasis added). This highlights the shrewd and profit-driven approach that Rhodes took in his political endeavors, blurring the lines between business and politics. [CITATION-116] After the negotiations, the Speaker contrasted this business style favorably to regular diplomacy, emphasizing the effectiveness of such an approach when two powerful individuals like the German Emperor and Mr. Rhodes meet with their minds made up to achieve their goals.

117,"The negotiations, as described by the author, highlight the effectiveness of this business style compared to regular diplomacy. The German Emperor and Mr. Rhodes, being astute individuals, were able to swiftly and smoothly conduct business, which was quite impressive compared to the usual pace of negotiations. It makes one wonder how long it would have taken regular diplomats to achieve the same level of practical work. The French also acknowledged that this approach was far from ordinary diplomacy. [CITATION-117] However, it is important to note that the focus on business in these negotiations may have been influenced by the German semi-official papers' attempt to divert attention.","Times, 16 Mar. 1899.",1
118,"Two such clever men as the German Emperor and Mr. Rhodes meet with their minds made up to do business, the business is generally done with a rapidity and a smoothness not a little surprising to the common run of negotiators … How long, it may be wondered, would the regular diplomatists have taken to accomplish so much practical work?’ The French agreed that it had been ‘nothing like ordinary diplomacy’. It is evident that the success of their meeting was a testament to the effectiveness of their direct approach and the efficiency of their decision-making process.

The focus on business could partly be explained by the attempt of the German semi-official papers to direct attention towards the merits of the Cape-to-Cairo ideas rather than towards Rhodes’s role in the Jameson Raid. This focus was partially copied by international papers, as illustrated by a Mozambican newspaper that even ran the sub-heading ‘Germany Ready to Help Rhodes: Business before sentiment!’[CITATION-119] In Britain, thereferenced the Berlin correspondent of the, who reported that the ‘colonial Jingoes’ in Berlin seemed to ‘have become astonishingly tame’ and that ‘“business knows no enmity” appears to be their motto.

120,"In Britain, the Manchester Guardian, in its report on the Jameson Raid, highlighted the business-like approach of the negotiation, stating that '“business knows no enmity” appears now to be the maxim in political quarters generally’.[CITATION-120] This perspective emphasizes the prioritization of economic interests over political tensions, suggesting a pragmatic approach to international relations.","Manchester Guardian, 13 Mar. 1899.",1
121,"Running politics in a business-like fashion can be seen as a dangerous precedent, as it allows individuals like Rhodes and Wilhelm II to bypass the government and make decisions without proper oversight. The fact that Rhodes did not receive the British government guarantee he requested raises concerns about the potential for unchecked power and influence in matters of imperial significance. The paper's exclamation that ""the Kaiser will see that in England for projects of imperial significance money can be obtained without the aid of Government"" highlights the need for a more transparent and accountable approach to decision-making.

Thus, in addition, it is evident that the private sector can often achieve more efficient and effective results compared to government-led initiatives.
