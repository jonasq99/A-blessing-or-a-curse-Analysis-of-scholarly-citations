Another chose the date on which the king signed the papers ordering Lángara’s squadron to depart. Four committee members voted for September 15, the date that the English captured a mail ship namedLa Princesaas it returned from Buenos Aires, a bellicose act.

According to Saxo, shortly after the Norman Conquest two sons of Harold went with an unnamed daughter of King Harold to King Svein Estritsson of Denmark (1042/7–74), who married her off to Vladimir II Monomakh (d. 1125), prince of Smolensk and Kiev.

Brock,Lord Liverpool and Liberal Toryism, 1820–1827(2nd edn, London, 1967). Brock’s link between liberal Toryism and classical political economy has been extensively questioned by Boyd Hilton’s emphasis on evangelicalism, most especially in B. Hilton,The Age of Atonement: The Influence of Evangelicalism on Social and Economic Thought, 1795–1865(Oxford, 1988); and with some adjustments in B. Hilton,A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People? England, 1783–1846(Oxford, 2006). For an alternative view, see N. Gash, review of Hilton,Age of Atonement, inEnglish Historical Review, civ (1989), pp. 136–40; N.

Harling,The Waning of ‘Old Corruption’: The Politics of Economical Reform in Britain, 1779–1846(Oxford, 1996).

Lee,George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827(Suffolk, 2008) emphasises both the particularity of this early nineteenth-century moment and frames the division between High and Liberal Tories as a spectrum rather than a simple binary.

A. Jackson,The Ulster Party: Irish Unionists in the House of Commons, 1884–1911(Oxford, 1989), pp. 11–12, drew on sociology, characterising nations by solidarity, to argue that Ulster Unionists could have developed claims to identify with the Ulster nation, but did not do so because it would have meant adopting the language of Irish Nationalists. In contrast, J. Loughlin,Ulster Unionism and British National Identity since 1885(London, 1995), pp. 195–6, argued that ‘unlike the Scots, Welsh and English, the unionists lacked an authentic myth of ethnic nationality as the basis on which an Ulster nationalism could develop’.

But Bod’s history is openly anachronistic: it asserts the continuities between humanities in different periods (and indeed regions), suggesting that anachronism is ‘useful rather than harmful’. This turns ‘the humanities’ into ana prioricategory. Still, Bod does pay more careful attention to obscure or forgotten scholars.

It seems vanishingly unlikely that Barham was not aware of Victor Cousin’s work, especially given Cousin’s association with Guizot and the doctrinaires.

Despite studies that consider individual Literary and Scientific and Mechanics’ Institutes, much more can be done with this body of sources, particularly at scale, and beyond the usual paradigms of the history of education or class-based analyses. In particular, recovering the particular conceptions that members and institutes had about disciplinary boundaries and the function of specific branches of knowledge beyond the natural and experimental sciences would illuminate many of the points raised in this article’s introduction. John Addington Symonds’s lectures at various Bristol institutions are a case in point. See, for example, hisKnowledge: An Introductory Address, Delivered at the Bristol Athenaeum(London, 1846). Collini, ‘Seeing a Specialist’, suggests sociological and institutional contexts are among the missing pieces to a history of humanities in the modern period. However, by ‘institutions’ Collini means universities specifically, but the institutes in Bristol, Bath and a great many other places throughout the country were important sites for the development of humanities and social-scientific discourses.', '99': 'Historians are beginning to fill the gap. See H. Ellis, ‘Classical Authors and ‘Scientific’ Research in the Early Years of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, 1781–1800’,Intellectual History Review, xxxii (2022), in press. I am grateful to Heather Ellis for discussions about this. Martin Daunton briefly alludes to the usefulness of these small provincial organisations as a potential source for understanding humane ideas and ‘a pluralistic and inclusive sense of English culture’ in the introduction to M. Daunton, ed.,The Organisation of Knowledge in Victorian Britain(Oxford, 2005), p. 21. In the same volume, Richard Drayton notes the ‘voluntary’ nature of organisations in the humanities in Britain: R. Drayton, ‘The Strange Late Birth of the British Academy’, in Daunton, ed.,Organisation of Knowledge, p. 392. As yet, there is no comprehensive study of the ‘Lit and Phils’ or their membership or activities, let alone one that considers them as part of the history of the humanities in Britain. However, these groups persisted into the twentieth century, and were significant enough to garner attention from the British Academy. In January 1920, the economist W.R. Scott proposed to the Academy that it should act as a consolidating organisation for ‘literary and other societies existing in the kingdom which are concerned with the humanistic studies’: London, British Academy, British Academy Minute Book iv (1919–1924), p. 35, ‘Memorandum on the Organisation of the Humanistic Societies’. I am grateful to Karen Syrett for providing me with a digital copy of the Minute Book.

{'*': 'This article is developed from talks given at Canterbury Christ Church University, Cardiff University and at the European Medieval Seminar at the Institute of Historical Research. I am also most grateful to Nicholas Vincent for commenting on a draft of the article, as will be evident at several points.', '1': 'Holt himself sets out the debate very fully, citing particularly Kate Norgate as an example of the maximum view of Langton’s role: J.C. Holt,Magna Carta(2nd edn., Cambridge, 1992), pp. 268–70, 280–87; K. Norgate,John Lackland(London, 1902), p. 234. Powicke’s account, as Holt points out (p. 270), has strands of both views: F.M. Powicke,Stephen Langton(Oxford, 1928), ch. 5. The most recent full-scale contribution to the debate is J.W. Baldwin, ‘Master Stephen Langton, Future Archbishop of Canterbury: The Paris Schools and Magna Carta’,ante, cxxiii (2008), pp. 811–46. I will discuss Baldwin’s ideas in what follows. The article on Langton in theOxford Dictionary of National Biographyis by Christopher Holdsworth. The most recent account of Langton’s career is N. Vincent, ‘Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury’ in L.-J. Bataillon, N. Bériou, G. Dahan and R. Quinto, eds.,Étienne Langton: Prédicateur, Bibliste, Théologien(Brepols, 2010). Vincent’s view (p. 97) is that ‘the archbishop’s hand lay heavily both upon the preliminary negotiations and upon the final terms of Magna Carta’.', '2': 'J. Stevenson, ed.,Radulphi Coggeshall Chronicon Anglicanum, R[olls] S[eries] (1875), pp. 166–7, 172. Ralph was abbot of the Cistercian monastery at Coggeshall in Essex. The Barnwell chronicle, perhaps the most acute and informed of the period, is known from a text that was preserved at Barnwell abbey in Cambridge, but it was not written there: W.

Luard, ed.,Matthaei Parisiensis Chronica Majora, RS (7 vols., 1872–83), ii. 550–51, 582–6.', '3': 'D. d’Avray, ‘Magna Carta: its Background in Stephen Langton’s Academic Biblical Exegesis and Its Episcopal Reception’,Studi Medievalii,3rd series, xxxviii (1997),pp. 426–7, 436.', '4': 'd’Avray, ‘Magna Carta’, pp. 428–9, 347–8; Baldwin, ‘Master Stephen Langton’, p. 813; P. Buc,L’Ambiguïté de Livre: Prince, Pouvoir, et Peuple dans Les Commentaires de la Bible au Moyen Age(Paris, 1994), pp. 282–3. Buc (pp. 281–2) also cites a remarkable passage from a commentary (not by Langton) from the last quarter of the twelfth century on 1 Kings (Samuel) 10, 25: ‘Samuel announced the law of the kingdom, that is to say what [the king] ought to exact from the people and what the latter ought to give him, and he laid down the writing [scripturam] before the lord, that is to say in the holy place, in order that if the king came to demand more from his subjects, he would be condemned by this writing drawn up by the holy prophet under the dictation of God.’ Buc translates ‘scriptura’ as ‘charte’. N. Fryde,Why Magna Carta? Angevin England Revisited(Münster, 2001), ch. 8, ‘The Intellectual Roots of Magna Carta’, pp. 100–11, argues that Langton derived his ideas about rulers being subject to the law from John of Salisbury. This chapter reprints her: ‘The Roots of Magna Carta. Opposition to the Plantagenets’ in J. Canning and O.G. Oexle, eds.,Political Thought and the Realities of Power in the Middle Ages(Göttingen, 1998), pp. 53–66.', '5': 'Baldwin, ‘Master Stephen Langton’, pp. 813–20 with the quotation at p. 820.', '6': 'J.W.

Cheney,Pope Innocent III and England(Stuttgart, 1976), p. 378.', '15': 'C.R. Cheney and W.H. Semple, ed.,Selected Letters of Pope Innocent III Concerning England(London, 1953), pp. 216–17. See Cheney,Innocent III and England, p. 385. Adam Chambers has pointed out to me an apparently remarkable passage in Langton’s sermon of 1213 in which, as translated by Baldwin (‘Master Stephen Langton’, p. 827), he declares that ‘If someone, even the king through his messengers, approached the Roman curia to obtain that objective [the lifting of the Interdict], we could not nor should we relax the sentence until the stolen property was fully restored’. This does not deny John access to Rome, but nonetheless suggests it would be of no value. A rather different translation (which I owe to Lesley Boatwright) would run as follows: ‘Nor did any of us approach the Roman curia when that clause [about the lifting of the Interdict] was being granted. Nay, rather, the lord king asked that, and gained his request through his messengers’. The Latin is ‘Nec aliquis nostrum Curiam Romanam adiit cum illud impetraretur capitulum, ut non relaxaretur interdictum donec restituerentur ablata; immo dominus rex illud postulauit et per nuntios suos impetrauit’: P. Roberts, ed.,Selected Sermons of Stephen Langton(Toronto, 1980), p. 48. The first editor of the sermon, George Lacombe, drew attention to the passage and observed that ‘There is something astonishing about this zeal for restitution manifested by the unscrupulous John’: G. Lacombe, ‘An Unpublished Document of the Great Interdict’,Catholic Historical Review, xv (1930), pp. 408–20, at 410. In fact, of course, it merely confirms just how unscrupulous John was. He had no intention of acting in accordance with his request nor did he.', '16': 'Holt,Magna Carta, pp. 440 (cap. 49), 472–3 (cap. 62), 491–2.', '17': 'Ibid., pp. 435, 464–7. I am following here what Holt (p. 286 and n. 102, and see pp. 341–2) thinks is the ‘obvious construction’ of the Latin in the Articles. However, as he says, it could mean that the archbishop and the bishops were to decide whether John should have the respite, and the clause was thus altered in Magna Carta because by then Langton had decided that he should. Whichever is the correct reading (and I think it is the first one), the point remains. If Langton had been involved with the Articles, he could have said at once that John would enjoy the respite, and the chapter in the Articles could have appeared as it does now in Magna Carta. As William Stewart-Parker points out to me, Langton here (which ever is the correct reading) was involved in making a change very much in John’s favour.', '18': 'Holt,Magna Carta, pp. 438 (caps. 45, 46), pp. 468–9 (caps. 58, 59).', '19': 'Ibid., pp. 437, 466–7.', '20': 'Holt,Magna Carta, p. 288, suggests that in distancing himself from these demands in the Articles, Langton was trying to preserve the distinction between the temporal and spiritual, but I am not clear that was always the reason. After all, Langton did agree in principle to sit in judgment on illicit fines and amercements.', '21': 'Cheney and Semple, ed.,Selected Letters of Pope Innocent III, pp. 196–7, 207–9. Even as it was, Langton’s refusal to condemn the rebels, of which John complained, was qualified. As John acknowledged in his letter of 29 May, Langton did offer to excommunicate and resist them, if John sent home his foreign mercenaries. Presumably, his hope was that the insurgents would then abandon their rebellion, making any excommunication unnecessary:Foedera, I, i, 129. Here, Langton was clearly acting as peacemaker not a partisan. See the wise comments of Richardson and Sayles about the baselessness of the charges against Langton: H.G. Richardson and G.O.

Rowlands observes that Langton’s failure to obey John’s courteous request of 9 August to surrender the castle is difficult to explain (p. 276). It may partly be that Langton had no power to expel the constable of the castle, Reginald of Cornhill. It was only after the quarrel over Rochester that John stigmatised Langton as a ‘notorious and manifest traitor’. He asked Hubert de Burgh to try and discover evidence from the captured garrison of Langton’s dealings with the barons. There is no sign he found any. See V.H.

As evidence, nonetheless, of Langton’s close engagement with the charter, he draws attention (pp. 94–5) to the first clause on ecclesiastical vacancies, which was also an issue in 1213–15. The clause seems to have had little impact in the later period, however, for the issue was treated very differently. In 1100, the king resigned all claims to revenues from vacancies. In 1213, the Pope said that John was only to lose them if he failed to honour his agreement with the church: Cheney and Semple, eds.,Select Letters of Innocent III, 133–4.

Under this umbrella, the church and laity are then kept separate, the charter being said to concern ‘the liberty of holy church and their liberties and free customs conceded to them’, ‘their’ and ‘them’ being the earls, barons and freemen: Holt,Magna Carta, p. 491.

Their final conclusion (p. 363) was characteristically forthright: ‘In truth, there is not, nor did Stubbs produce, a vestige of evidence that Langton was one of the architects of the Great Charter, let alone the principal architect, and to cast him for such a role is an absurdity’. Elsewhere, however (p. 337), Richardson and Sayles were rather fairer to Stubbs, who saw Langton as important in 1215 but also gave credit to the barons: W.

I also doubt whether the Articles of the Barons are the product of such negotiations.
