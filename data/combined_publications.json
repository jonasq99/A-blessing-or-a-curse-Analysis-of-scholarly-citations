It examines Pax Romana, the Swiss-based international association of Catholic students and graduates, as it navigated between fascism and resistance in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and during the global conflict of 1939\u201345. The organisation was headed successively by two young activists from Spain, Joaqu\u00edn Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, a legal scholar from Madrid who fought for Franco, and Ramon Sugranyes de Franch, a Catalan literary specialist who went into exile in 1936. Comparison of their parallel careers forms the central narrative cord of the article, illuminating the complex relationship of national to global Catholic fractures between conservative nation-statists and political and social pluralists. The Pax Romana congress held in Spain in 1946 was pivotal in accounting for the transnational legacy of that country\u2019s civil war. The wartime \u2018humanist\u2019 critique of Franco\u2019s \u2018crusade\u2019 made by key Catholic public thinkers was both disseminated and challenged and its relevance to Europe\u2019s future assessed. Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, as its president, used the organisation from Spain to legitimate the country\u2019s regime, aided by sympathetic foreign nation-statists. Sugranyes, in contrast, gravitated in the early 1940s to Fribourg in Switzerland, Pax Romana\u2019s headquarters\u2014via Geneva, Paris and southern France\u2014encountering and allying with progressive Catholic exiles from Italy and Spain and French anti-fascist resisters. Although taking different routes, both men ultimately transcended their nationally rooted religious and political assumptions through dialogue across boundaries.When military rebels, including Francisco Franco, rose up against the elected Spanish government in July 1936, the state structures of the Second Republic were destabilised. This allowed leftist revolutionary militias, in response, to target middle-class Catholics with elite political backgrounds or a connection to the military rebellion. Among hundreds imprisoned in Madrid, ostensibly for their protection, was the 23-year-old scholar of canon law and president of Spain\u2019s Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional de Estudiantes Cat\u00f3licos (CNEC), Joaqu\u00edn Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, and his two brothers. The CNEC functioned within the orbit of Catholic Action, the Vatican\u2019s main transnational conduit of social Catholicism, allied closely in Spain with the elite intellectual publicists of the Asociaci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica Nacional de Propagandistas (ACNP), founded in 1909. These bodies were vehicles for mobilising Catholic society against the government\u2019s social and religious reforms of 1931\u20133 and for overturning the Republican constitution which separated Church and state. Amid the inchoate revolution which broke out in response to the military coup in 1936, the lives of the Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez brothers were therefore in peril. Their release was secured only because of the intervention of the Republican wartime Minister of the Interior, \u00c1ngel Galarza. After taking refuge in the Panamanian embassy, they departed safely for rebel territory to join up with the insurgent forces, as did large numbers of political Catholics whose unity was sealed by what quickly became Franco\u2019s \u2018crusade\u2019.[CITATION-1] At virtually the same moment that Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was arrested in Madrid, his Catalan contemporary, the literary specialist Ramon Sugranyes de Franch, fled revolutionary Barcelona for Switzerland. The network of student internationalism to which Sugranyes was connected made escape possible. As vice-president since 1929 of the Catalan Catholic student federation, he was invited in August 1936 to the first conference of the World Youth Congress at the League of Nations in Geneva and issued with a safe conduct to travel by the Catalan Republican government. Following the failed military coup in Barcelona, his position as a Catholic student organiser made Sugranyes as vulnerable to attack by criminal elements as Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was in Madrid. Incipient Christian Democracy was more vigorous in Catalonia than in most of Spain and the Federaci\u00f3 Catalana d\u2019Estudiants Cat\u00f2lics had supported the Republican government when the regime was inaugurated in 1931.[CITATION-2] Sugranyes was, moreover, publicly active in the Republican project for an autonomous university in Barcelona, relatively independent of the central state, as an expression of regionalist civic sentiment. But his consequent misgivings about the Spanish military rebellion did not diminish the personal threat to his life in the revolutionary summer of 1936. This ambivalence would later prevent him from returning to Franco\u2019s Spain for many years.This article compares the parallel traumatic experiences of Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes de Franch during and after the Spanish Civil War. The biographical comparison reveals a shared cultural conditioning as young activists within a global Church as well as an undercutting of this commonality by fundamental differences. Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez (1913\u20132009), a Spaniard from Madrid who fought for Franco, became a professor of civil and religious law in the early 1940s while acting internationally on behalf of the head of state. He was publicly unstinting in his loyalty, never contradicting the myth of Franco as saviour of the Spanish nation-state and defender of \u2018the Christian West\u2019. Relative to Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, the Catalan-speaking Sugranyes de Franch (1911\u20132011) was a Catholic outsider, as resolutely anti-Communist as his contemporary but unconvinced by the Spanish nationalist claims of the insurgents and the moral force and doctrinal legitimacy of their \u2018holy war\u2019. He became increasingly doubtful during the civil war years of exile and the broader European conflict of 1939\u201345. Intensive engagement with humanitarian activity and ideas in France and Switzerland reinforced his commitment to religious and political pluralism.The essential disparities between Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes go to the heart of global Catholic fissures during the trans-war era of the 1930s and 1940s. By exploring the interplay of ideas and events as they affected political Catholics such as them\u2014and by paying close attention to chronology\u2014it is possible to see how connections between successive conflicts were a factor in the origins of Christian Democratic predominance in Western Europe after 1945. This political ascendency resulted from a blend of the Church\u2019s conservatism in the 1930s and the anti-fascist resistance of a minority of Catholics, especially in 1939\u201345. And yet, the transnational effects of Spain\u2019s war of 1936\u20139, the dictatorship resulting from it, and the emigration of the anti-Franco Catholic diaspora as it interacted with opponents of fascism elsewhere in Europe, have not been explored. They help to delineate important continuities and complexities in the fracturing of the Church between conservative nation-statists and those advocating political and social fraternalism.[CITATION-3] As well as bringing this trans-chronology into view, an examination of the key roles played by Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes in Pax Romana, the international federation of Roman Catholic university students and graduates, opens up a fundamental and neglected aspect of the transbackground to the Christian Democratic political breakthrough. The flow of people and exchange of ideas and symbols across borders during wartime energised individuals in transcending national perspectives. Through their successive leadership of Pax Romana both men travelled intellectually and politically beyond the confined spaces of their previous models of politics and religion.[CITATION-4] Pax Romana was founded in Fribourg, Switzerland, in 1921, as an international network for distributing charity, dispensing educative and cultural guidance, and funding foreign scholarships. More importantly, it provided a transnational forum where debate distilled broad trends in Catholic thought at a time when the Church had to respond to the totalitarian challenges of fascism and Communism.[CITATION-5] The organisation thus provided access to ideas through which Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes made sense of their flight from revolution in 1936 and navigated the material, spiritual and ideological battles that followed.[CITATION-6] In the aftermath of the civil war, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez became international president of Pax Romana, occupying the role during the tumultuous era until 1946. This proved instrumental in his appointment as Franco\u2019s ambassador to the Vatican in 1948\u201350 and Minister of Education in 1951, from which post he was discharged in 1956 for embarking on liberalising reform.[CITATION-7] He later became a figurehead of Christian Democratic opposition in Spain, a trajectory he traced to his border-crossing experiences of the 1940s. Contact with Rome came initially through Pax Romana and subsequently\u2014closer to power\u2014during the Holy See ambassadorship. The city constituted not only Vatican \u2018Command Central\u2019, however, but also a hub of ideas. As Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez later declared, \u2018I had lived through the Catholicism of our war, the Catholicism of \u201ccrusade\u201d and of the confessional state; in Rome, by contrast, I found myself with men who understood Catholicism in a different way \u2026 the first men of Christian Democracy\u2019, who did not condemn the civil war\u2019s exiles as Francoist state ideology required.[CITATION-8] In June 1946, Pax Romana\u2019s world congress was controversially held in Franco\u2019s Spain, thanks largely to the efforts of Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez. Following the congress he stood down and, as part of a thorough overhaul, a new Pax leadership was elected, including Ramon Sugranyes as Secretary General, a post he held until 1958.[CITATION-9] The paths of the itinerant exile and the ostensible Franco loyalist seldom intersected directly. But their parallel lives, and eventual convergence in the early 1960s as forward-thinking lay assessors at the Second Vatican Council, illustrate the contested nature of the post-war resurgence of the intellectual laity and its relation to events both past and present.[CITATION-10] The 1946 Pax Romana congress in Spain was not primarily about Vatican authority. Rather, it demonstrated the depth of the intellectual breach in the Church and was pivotal to the revival of lay influence. To the Fribourg executive of Pax in 1946, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez stood for Franco\u2019s Spain, an inconvenient symbol not only of fascism but also of a brand of Catholicism\u2014with considerable international traction\u2014which obsessed about \u2018Bolshevism\u2019 and depended for protection on state centralism and an imposed social order founded on the family as base unit for reproducing the patriarchal and homogeneous nation. Sugranyes, meanwhile, symbolised a new, forward-looking Catholicism, associated with the public rejection of fascism and adaptable to post-war demands. Two key public intellectuals to whom Sugranyes gravitated during the Spanish and European conflicts exemplified this civic pluralism as they condemned the wartime Francoists. The first was Jacques Maritain, the French neo-Thomist philosopher, who in 1937 denounced Franco\u2019s legitimating \u2018holy war\u2019 thesis as sacrilege and later served as France\u2019s ambassador to the Vatican between 1945 and 1948. The other was Father Luigi Sturzo, the founder of the Partito Popolare Italiano, who had been exiled from Fascism in 1924, and who (like Maritain) insisted that Spain\u2019s war was inescapably aconflict rather than being about redeeming Christian civilisation.[CITATION-11] Their version of the faith as a frame for lived experience derived in part from this critique of nation-statism.Maritain\u2019s philosophy of \u2018integral humanism\u2019 was fundamental. Articulated first amid Nazism\u2019s consolidation of power, it focused on the doctrine of \u2018personalism\u2019 which\u2014confronted by the opposing forces of totalitarianism and unchecked liberal individualism\u2014set out a route to a just temporal order through respect for human dignity.[CITATION-12] These ideas, backed by fellow critics of the Church, drew Catholic attention transnationally towards the potential of political pluralism.[CITATION-13] In Maritain\u2019s terms, the Spanish rebels\u2019 violent action was in effect on a continuum with Nazi extreme nation-statism, an analysis which rapidly filtered through to Sugranyes.[CITATION-14] Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez never acknowledged such a position, maintaining that the civil war had simply been a victory won by Catholics, but from the mid-1940s he began hesitantly to absorb Maritainist ideas, largely through the transnational capillaries of Pax Romana.Whereas for many Catholics globally the Spanish conflict assumed epic significance\u2014condensing centuries of the Church\u2019s embattled history\u2014for Maritain and Sturzo it illuminated fundamental problems of the faith. Repositioning the Church meant harnessing the laity\u2019s critical faculties. The impact of their proposition needs to be gauged, however, by focusing less on these pre-eminent figures than upon the intellectuals who performed the spadework of international associations dedicated to shaping potential leaders in society\u2019s new temporal order. Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes represented a wide socio-professional group which encompassed academics, teachers, journalists, lawyers, scientists, doctors, engineers and others.[CITATION-15] Viewed from the vantage point of this social body\u2014the transnational rank-and-file of Pax Romana\u2014we can see that the organisation\u2019s trans-war progressive evolution (as explored in the following sections on the 1930s and 1940s) depended on an active struggle between rivals \u2018from below\u2019. This was a political and theological struggle initiated by disputing the meaning of the war in Spain. The resulting differences overhung the painful adaptation of Pax Romana\u2014and, by extension, that of the Church\u2014to the world order ushered in by the Second World War.Throughout the 1930s, unprecedented levels of foreign travel produced a \u2018new internationalism of university youth\u2019 by which Catholics mixed warily with secular groups.[CITATION-16] The fracturing experience of Spain\u2019s war thus affected Catholic youthful activism internationally. Most of the university branches within each country\u2019s Catholic lay structures were affiliated to Pax Romana, gaining access to its international network.[CITATION-17] In the post-1917 anti-communist struggle, Pius XI bestowed special significance on the university apostolic associations, equivalent to \u2018military academies\u2019, from which it was intended \u2018a general staff\u2019 would emerge.[CITATION-18] Activists were expected by the Holy See to restrict themselves to tasks specific to the pontificate, but the injunction to keep apart from national politics was severely tested amid the polarisation of Europe in the 1930s.In Spain, following the fall of the military dictatorship in 1930, the existing political edifice of Throne and Altar appeared to be crumbling. The new mass politics was animated by a youthful generation which, on one side, mobilised to promote change as promised by the egalitarian and secular values of the Second Republic, inaugurated in 1931. On the other, secularism was actively resisted by the mobilised young who were trained by Catholic Action to defend the \u2018Christian essence of the nation\u2019 against what was portrayed as \u2018Communism\u2019, even if not all activists advocated an integrally Catholic state.[CITATION-19] The Republic\u2019s projected law of 1933 to limit the influence of religious orders, by ending their role in education, hardened Catholic rejection of the Republic, though less so in regionalist Catalonia. In common with much of the urban upper-middle classes, both Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez (the son of a mayor of Madrid during the monarchy) and Sugranyes (whose mother was of the Catalan propertied class and whose father was successor to the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed) were educated in exclusive confessional schools, the purpose of which was to produce active Christian leaders in the professions.[CITATION-20] Immersion in student associations followed for both young men, although the implications of Catholic activism in Barcelona were significantly different from Madrid. Catholics in Catalonia were constrained by the inward-looking centralism of both the Spanish state and the ecclesiastical hierarchy. As part of a community which felt culturally and linguistically beleaguered, the Catalan Church during the nationally formative late nineteenth century in the region became a relatively popular and enlightened presence; its intellectuals looked to other parts of Western Europe for a model of Catholic modernity. Cultural difference was thus accentuated by religion. Catalan culture and language were, for example, absent from Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s primary, secondary and university education in Madrid, and, he recalled, Catalan claims during the Republic were not tackled by the Church or the state as expressions of legitimate identity but as political and constitutional threats.[CITATION-21] Sugranyes had supported the Republican government in 1931 because it recognised this regionalist-national sentiment. Christian Democracy had a significant presence in Catalonia and a Catholic political party, the(UDC), had been founded in 1931 around the young lawyer Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera, in support of social reform and pluralism. Sugranyes had moved away from the conservatism of his father, who supported the Catalanist party of the upper bourgeoisie, the Lliga Regionalista, towards the UDC\u2019s civic reforming priorities. The party\u2019s leader, Carrasco, was critical of \u2018Catholics of convenience\u2019, for example, who argued against the government\u2019s 1933 law to restrict the influence of religious congregations merely because they wished the paternalist state to continue to protect their material privileges. He critiqued the law instead by asserting the rights of Catholics as fraternal citizens of the Republic. In so doing he invoked the regime\u2019s own constitutional promise to defer to the universal rights of national minorities.[CITATION-22] This position reinforced the image which Spanish integrists had of Catalan Catholics as a potentially threatening \u2018other\u2019.Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes thus shared in the formative collective imagination of educated Catholics, while the sources of their wartime divergence were also deeply rooted. Following the Popular Front electoral victory of February 1936, the military rebellion which led to civil war was expected. It was welcomed by Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, who was convinced that the Thomist doctrine stating the right of Catholics to rebel against tyranny justified taking up arms against the laicising Republic once a legalist electoral strategy had failed. He was typical of Catholics who had never advocated a military or fascist coup but could not stomach a Church cut down to size in the interests of modernity. By 1936 Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez believed that only the army could protect the Church. He suffered no crisis of conscience in supporting the officers\u2019 coup when it came, in contrast to the deeply conflicted Sugranyes.[CITATION-23] The Vatican was broadly supportive of the rebels\u2019 \u2018holy war\u2019 even though they were aided by the Axis states. The murder of priests in the Republican wartime zone was deeply lamented and Pius XI\u2019s March 1937 encyclical against Communism () cited this religious persecution, his message avidly disseminated in the rebel zone by Acci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica and the ACNP.[CITATION-24] Yet the regional dimension of the civil war forced the attention of Catholics globally towards questions about the communion between the Church and the faithful. The Vatican fell short of giving unconditional support to the \u2018crusade\u2019, in large part because Franco\u2019s stated aim was to extirpate Basque and Catalan regionalism, despite both being Catholic, either entirely (in the first case) or significantly (in the second).[CITATION-25] The Church was thus confronted by the limits of papal authority when faced with ethno-Catholic statism in Spain which deployed violence in the name of the faith even against Catholics. In April 1938, Manuel Carrasco became the most well-known victim of Francoist brutality against Catalan Catholicism when he was captured and executed, despite Luigi Sturzo\u2019s mustering of international Catholic protest, with the help of Alfredo Mendiz\u00e1bal, the Christian Democratic Spanish lawyer, by this time exiled in Paris with Sugranyes.[CITATION-26] All Catalanists were abhorred by the military rebels, even those who favoured the Francoists once war came and mounted propaganda internationally on behalf of the generals\u2019 \u2018crusade\u2019, as the elitist Lliga Regionalista did from Geneva and Paris.[CITATION-27] Rebel hostility was particularly scornful, however, towards the forward-thinking archbishop of the Catalan diocese of Tarragona, Francesc Vidal i Barraquer, who like Sugranyes had escaped the revolution in 1936 with the help of the regional Republican government. Barraquer declined to sign the much-publicised July 1937 collective letter of the Spanish bishops supporting the rebels and his return to Tarragona after Franco\u2019s victory was blocked by the new regime. The archbishop was given refuge first in Italy and later in Fribourg, becoming a figurehead for progressive Catholic exiles there.[CITATION-28] They included Sugranyes, who from exile publicised key texts of Catalan Catholic culture as potential exemplars of a single, forward-thinking, national identity.[CITATION-29] Displaced Catalans in Switzerland nonetheless formed two mutually antagonistic networks: the larger (based on the conservative Lliga) supported the generals\u2019 rebellion for the sake of order and property; the smaller, loosely associated with the UDC, was condemned by the majority for its scepticism.[CITATION-30] Sugranyes\u2014who had been formally called upby both contending forces in Spain\u2014was refused absolution by a Catalan priest at Geneva\u2019s Basilica of Our Lady, in November 1936, because he had not returned to Spain \u2018to fight for Christ the King\u2019. His confession was taken instead by Maritain\u2019s confidant, Father Charles Journet, with whom Sugranyes was put in touch by another Catalan priest, Carles Card\u00f3, who was taught by Journet at the seminary in Fribourg.[CITATION-31] The anti-Leftism of Sugranyes\u2014and of Card\u00f3\u2014was nevertheless clear: he considered the Left Republicans in control of the Catalan government (the Generalitat) to be collaborators of the revolution because they \u2018handed power to the rabble\u2019 by agreeing to share power with anarchists after they helped resist the military rebellion of July 1936. He went so far as to discuss a possible counter-revolutionary coup of Catalan exiles against the Generalitat to forestall the region\u2019s occupation by Franco.[CITATION-32] Card\u00f3 agreed about the need to suppress the \u2018red Catalans\u2019; when Sugranyes voiced his indecision about returning either to Burgos (HQ of the rebels) or to Barcelona, his mentor advised that the latter was impossible: \u2018At the orders of Moscow, never!\u2019[CITATION-33] Sugranyes thus objected strongly to the revolution; but he also rejected \u2018the lesser evil\u2019 of fighting with a violently centralisingforce. The thought of supporting the imposition of \u2018a forced and artificial religiosity with sacred images draped in Field-Marshal\u2019s robes\u2019 was impossible.[CITATION-34] Crucially, communication with Maritain and, first, Sturzo\u2014to whom he turned for counsel, with Card\u00f3\u2019s encouragement, in early 1937\u2014led Sugranyes to a fusion of his Catalanist objection to the rebels with a broader Catholic humanist analysis.[CITATION-35] Sugranyes began to accept abstention from the conflict and talked in social Catholic terms of \u2018self-elevation\u2019 as a means to rising above the contending parties.[CITATION-36] Contact with pro-Franco Catalans had convinced him that they possessed \u2018a certain love of the White terror\u2019.[CITATION-37] From Sturzo he sought spiritual and political affirmation as well as help with finding employment, possibly in London.[CITATION-38] His vacillation over entwined religious, political and national allegiances was palpable, as were the limits of his analysis of the Republic:we Catalans have seen our country treacherously put in the hands of the worst enemies of Christian civilization: communists and anarchists. We were thus obliged to put the destinies of our country in the hands of the rebel generals as the only means of restoring order and peace.And yet reliance on the generals spelled \u2018immense dangers\u2019 because it would mean government established upon \u2018a tragic basis of hate and spitefulness\u2019.[CITATION-39] Sturzo\u2019s decisive reply, defining the war as a social conflict, offered a rational critique of the \u2018holy war\u2019 myth. As he saw it, anti-clerical workers in Spain \u2018became angry with God\u2019 because the Church had failed to back social reform. It then further mortgaged itself by siding with \u2018the crusade\u2019. Total victory of one side over the other could not bring genuine peace, he argued, nor overcome the Church\u2019s probable consequent crisis caused by dependence on an authoritarian state.[CITATION-40] Sturzo\u2019s advice reflected an emerging fraternalism, which became a framework for Sugranyes by virtue of exiled existence among fellow Catholic outsiders. At its heart was a critique of traditionalist patriarchal sanctities. The fate of Sugranyes\u2019s planned marriage exemplified, indeed, how the political and the personal converged in wartime conditions, creating possibilities for re-imagining the relationship between public and private. Betrothed to a young woman whose pro-Lliga family supported the Spanish generals, he was pressured to return and join the rebels and was accused of being a \u2018coward\u2019 and a \u2018traitor\u2019.[CITATION-41] It was his friend, Carles Eugeni Mascarenyes, with whom he had left Barcelona for Geneva in 1936, who offered a reasoned Catholic alternative. Following Maritain\u2014who in 1934 explicitly deprecated the bourgeois paternalist norm of marriage reduced to social convention\u2014Mascarenyes (from his own site of refuge in Toulouse) suggested a model of marriage as an affective coupling based on \u2018a communion of political and moral ideas\u2019. Ultimately, his friend insisted, Sugranyes was\u2014or should aspire to be\u2014\u2018a different kind of man, a humanist, if you like\u2019.[CITATION-42] The betrothal was thus ended; within two years Sugranyes met his future wife, Liselotte Bickel, an exiled German convert of Jewish background, while both were working temporarily for the League of Nations in Geneva. For Sugranyes, war sharpened the Catholic fraternalist critique of patriarchal marriage and, it should be added, of antisemitism, both in general and within the Church.[CITATION-43] Sugranyes thus justified abstention through what he perceived as the moral deficiencies of nation-statist Catholics who acquiesced in violence and totalitarianism. To Sturzo, in June 1937, he voiced his revulsion at \u2018the wave of uncivilised passions, cruelties and lusts unleashed by the (Spanish) war\u2019, condemning \u2018the political immorality, profiteers, and despoilers\u2019 who surfaced in its shadow. These opportunists were \u2018hardly less widespread (in the rebel zone) than among the so-called Reds\u2019. Among them were Catholics who cleaved to state power and relished the Church\u2019s sharing of the public sphere alongside the military rebels and falangists. The chances for Maritain\u2019s conjectured \u2018civic fraternities\u2019 were being buried by a \u2018complete lack of charity in private relationships\u2019; people had \u2018made a way of life out of denunciation (of enemies)\u2019. This was \u2018morally worse among the \u201cwhites\u201d (who belonged) to classes which claim superiority\u2019. The criticism owed something to historic Catalanist claims to supremacy in the task (still pending, as they saw it) of constructing a modern state in Spain. The real cause of the war, Sugranyes declared, was a lack of intelligence, \u2018of a cultivated and responsible elite for many decades\u2019, culminating in a war between \u2018proletarian masses\u2019 and \u2018bourgeois masses\u2019.[CITATION-44] His critique was nevertheless fired by the energising transnational experience of fraternalist Catholic theory and practice.The dialogue with Sturzo was vital as Sugranyes remained materially vulnerable, unable to obtain assistance from Pax Romana\u2019s Secretariat, to which he made a request in April 1937.[CITATION-45] At a time when the organisation\u2019s public position depended on the approval of the pro-rebel Bishop of Fribourg\u2014Pax\u2019s honorary president\u2014there was no appetite to engage actively with the Maritainist critique of Franco\u2019s war. The organisation\u2019s newspaper steered clear of the conflict, indeed, until early 1938. Collecting aid for Catholic students in Spain was all that could be done, apart from disseminating in the Catholic university press the tendentious collective letter of the Spanish bishops.[CITATION-46] Despite Pax\u2019s official quietism it was nonetheless impossible to suppress all criticism. At the World Congress in Ljubljana in 1938 one delegate ventured that the Church\u2019s social failings in Spain had created a barrier to the poor. The workers had burned churches in revolutionary Barcelona at the same time as displaying posters referencing the 1891 social teachings of Leo XIII and pronouncing: \u2018This is what Catholicism\u2014and this is what we\u2019.[CITATION-47] As Sturzo had written to Sugranyes, \u2018the Spaniard is Catholic in his own way, even when burning churches as a form of protest\u2019.[CITATION-48] This social analysis was relatively marginal, however, remaining so during much of the European war, until the opportunity arose to question fundamental assumptions at Pax\u2019s momentous 1946 congress in Spain. In 1938 Pax remained publicly conservative, heralding the student branch of Spanish Catholic Action as the engine of future Spanish regeneration, for example.[CITATION-49] By 1946, such a position was untenable.Francoist discourse during the war in Spain was the antithesis of Sturzo\u2019s social analysis. The leitmotif was collective martyrdom, based on the killing of priests and lay Catholics in the Republican war zone, especially in the conflict\u2019s early months. In recognition, the central theme of Pax\u2019s 1938 congress had been \u2018the Catholic student faced with Communism\u2019. The Primate of Spain, Isidro Gom\u00e1, wrote to the organisation\u2019s Swiss Secretary General, Father Joseph Gremaud, explaining Spaniards\u2019 inevitable absence and affirming that \u2018our martyred and blood-drenched Spain is firm proof of what Communism brings with it\u2019.[CITATION-50] When Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was elected president a year later he was thus imbued with symbolic capital as a youthful \u2018crusader\u2019 and survivor of his own personal encounter with \u2018Communism\u2019. Shortly before, he attended the assembly of the South American Catholic student body in Lima as a man of faith forged in battle \u2018who had suffered (the war\u2019s) tremendous trauma\u2019.[CITATION-51] The symbolism of sacrifice had been vindicated by the deliberate inclusion among the Spanish delegation of young men visually exhibiting combat wounds.[CITATION-52] The fraternalist counter to the martyrdom narrative depended publicly on the Comit\u00e9 pour la Paix Civile et Religieuse en Espagne, established in Paris and supplemented by Spanish and British equivalents. It relied on Sturzo and Maritain, backed by Cardinal Barraquer, Alfredo Mendiz\u00e1bal and other Catholic exiles.[CITATION-53] This committee became a vehicle for schooling Sugranyes and others in humanitarian organisation. When paid employment dried up in Geneva, he relocated to Paris where the Comit\u00e9 was based, lodging in early 1939 at the same hotel as Mendiz\u00e1bal. In April 1938, he had presented a report on the exchange of prisoners and civilian evacuation to the Committee\u2019s conference, undertaking also to establish a Swiss peace committee. Pro-Franco Swiss Catholics made this difficult and Sugranyes commented on the \u2018provincialism\u2019 of the Catholic milieu in Geneva, paralysed by its \u2018terrible fear of Communism\u2019.[CITATION-54] Ultimately, Catholic fraternalism would be boosted by the shifting balance among Catholic intellectuals as a result of Hitler\u2019s war in Europe. The laity was strengthened, at the same time, by the growing prominence of its technocratic and professional sections and their active involvement in transnational resistance to occupation and fascism.[CITATION-55] The war in Spain cast a shadow over Pax Romana during 1940\u201346 as the organisation manoeuvred intellectually between fascism and resistance. As they joined with others displaced during the European war, border-crossing exiles from Spain helped crystallise Catholic aspirations for post-war Europe. Ambitious ideas were fertilised in a specific geographic space, encompassing France, Italy and ultimately Germany\u2014with neutral Switzerland in-between\u2014from where Christian Democratic hegemony later emerged. Gremaud evoked an intellectual utopia, indeed, in his representation of exile-enriched Fribourg as \u2018a little Europe\u2019, an image he extended to the entire country as \u2018one vast university\u2019, associating Swiss neutrality with emerging fraternalist ideas.[CITATION-56] It was an impression shaped by an environment very different to that of Catholics in Spain, whose anti-Communism fed self-referentially upon triumphalist Francoism after April 1939.With the fall of Paris, Sugranyes, Mendiz\u00e1bal and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sempr\u00fan\u2014another Spanish critic of nation-statist Catholicism\u2014headed for the main centres of Spanish Republican exile, first Bordeaux, then Toulouse and L\u2019Auche, where diverse strands of anti-fascism coalesced in reaction to the heavy-handed Vichy authorities. When P\u00e9tain visited L\u2019Auche in early 1941, Republican refugees and other anti-Vichyites were \u2018rounded up\u2019 to avoid protests against the government. Card\u00f3 wrote to Sugranyes lamenting the attitude of the French Church hierarchy: the connivance of \u2018so many Constantinian dignitaries in this unintelligent, squandered world\u2019.[CITATION-57] From Franco\u2019s Spain, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez situated himself and the Spanish regime differently, aligned with leading figures of this same French hierarchy. In April 1942 he visited Montpellier to speak at the twentieth anniversary celebration of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise des \u00c9tudiants Catholiques (FFEC) beside the Archbishop of Lyons, Cardinal Gerlier, an enthusiast for P\u00e9tain\u2019s authoritarian \u2018regeneration\u2019 of France.[CITATION-58] Sugranyes meanwhile was fortunate that a job opportunity arose at Fribourg University in 1941 thanks to the support of Fathers Journet and Card\u00f3, as well as the Italian anti-fascist Gianfranco Contini, chair of Romance Philology there since 1938. Another exile in Switzerland who gave support was the socialist literary scholar Giuliano Bonfante, who had fought for the Spanish Republic.[CITATION-59] Among significant opponents of fascism who became leaders of Pax Romana within this milieu was the French mining engineer Roger Millot, a former president of the FFEC and Pax\u2019s vice-president after 1939. Alongside Millot, the internationalism of Sugranyes developed, first in Paris and later in Fribourg, and the two men were ultimately instrumental in formulating the statutes of the renovated organisation in 1946\u20137.[CITATION-60] In the pre-war years, Millot worked with the Christian Democratic reviewand with Cardinal Verdier, both critics of Action Fran\u00e7aise and active in combatting antisemitism. In these respects Millot was a disciple of Maritain and, with the fall of France, he joined the \u2018Rue de Verneuil\u2019 resistance group with like-minded Catholics.[CITATION-61] One of these was Father Michel Riquet, another Pax progressive inspired by Maritain\u2019s, which sustained him in the 1930s and later during his detention in the Nazi camps following deportation.[CITATION-62] Millot was active in the progressive Centre Universitaire Catholique, established clandestinely in 1941, becoming its vice-president in 1945.[CITATION-63] From 1944, he supported the Mouvement R\u00e9publicain Populaire (MRP) and organisations advocating reconciliation with Germany, European unity and greater lay participation to equip the Church for a reconstructive effort through flatter Catholic hierarchies.[CITATION-64] Public leadership of Pax Romana until 1946 nonetheless remained in the hands of Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez. As Pax international president and Franco propagandist\u2014funded by the Spanish state\u2014he was given a platform and was able to travel abroad. His aim was to legitimate Franco\u2019s anti-Communist regime by playing down former Axis links and diverting attention towards the new peril from the East which he believed had been responsible for Spain\u2019s tragedy. For his politicism, indeed, he would be censured by the Pax executive in early 1946.[CITATION-65] Such was the pessimism generated from Spain about the West\u2019s weakened anti-Communist resolve that a Bolivian delegate to the 1946 Pax congress was moved to react by declaring his rejection of \u2018Europe\u2019s decrepitude\u2019.[CITATION-66] The congress would in fact be divided over what the political resurgence of Western Europe really meant and what role Catholics should play.Despite the UN\u2019s condemnation of Franco\u2019s regime, the next global assembly of Pax Romana, delayed from 1940, went ahead in June 1946. Fribourg was concerned that holding it in Franco\u2019s Spain would appear \u2018in the eyes of leftists, and even among Catholics\u2019, as proof of the \u2018sympathy\u2019 of Catholics and \u2018even of the Vatican\u2019 for \u2018fascist regimes\u2019.[CITATION-67] Such accusations were \u2018false\u2019, according to the Pax executive, but it was only too aware of criticism from anti-fascists, including Catholic students exiled from the civil war, for holding the \u2018grand spectacle\u2019 in Spain:Franco, whose pagan Falange wishes to cover itself with a pious veil, always tries to hide behind the screen of a false Catholicism. But true Catholics will not let themselves be trapped. Catholic students of the entire world, who fought with the rest of the youth against the infamous regimes of Hitler and Mussolini, will not play the game of Franco, a temporary vestige of the Axis regimes.[CITATION-68] The executive\u2019s doubts about the congress were hardly mollified by the manner of its inauguration, held on Corpus Christi in the image of the Constantinian Church that Sugranyes despised. Culminating in the palace of the Cardinal primate in Toledo, the ceremony followed High Mass and a military-escorted public procession of the consecrated Host. Toledo was the medieval heart of Christian Spain, the pinnacle of a historical triangle evoking the Counter-Reformation, with congress sessions also planned at Salamanca and El Escorial.[CITATION-69] Some 500 delegates participated, half of them from Spain, supplemented by large contingents from South America and Portugal. The ethno-Catholic emphasis was reinforced by the inaugural session\u2019s focus on the Hispanic imperial legacy: spiritual and cultural unity \u2018born of a great Christian State\u2019, an autarkic form of power in the interests of national sovereignty. All attempts at \u2018exoticism imported from outside\u2019, it was argued, \u2018tended towards abolition of spiritual hierarchy\u2019.[CITATION-70] This conservative nation-statism was shared by the dozen or so \u2018ecclesiastical advisers\u2019 from Rome, several of them recently displaced from Eastern Europe. Spanish, Polish and Ukrainian delegates, thus united, declared themselves anti-Communist not only as Catholics but also \u2018as patriots\u2019 because, \u2018while Catholicism had made the existence of many nations possible, Communism aspires only to their disappearance\u2019. The function of Catholic universities in this \u2018Christian state\u2019 model was to participate in nation-building, reorientating Catholic ideas by counteracting \u2018modern intellectuals\u2019.[CITATION-71] Smaller delegations, from Britain, the USA and Italy, were more ideologically diverse, several being sympathetic to delegates representing the progressive Fribourg executive\u2014including Millot\u2014who had embraced Sugranyes and other refugees during the war.As a civil war exile and disciple of Maritain and Sturzo, there was no question of Sugranyes running the gauntlet of the congress. Maritain himself believed Pax profoundly mistaken in holding the event in Franco\u2019s Spain and would not set foot there. In protest he went further, declining an invitation later in the year to the organisation\u2019s jubilee congress in Fribourg.[CITATION-72] He was also aware that the context of Stalinist expansion appeared to favour conservative anti-Communism. Congress discussion about \u2018peoples in servitude\u2019 was indeed framed by Eastern Europe\u2019s experience rather than that of recently defeated fascist states or Spain, the only exception being a call\u2014significantly, from a Basque delegate\u2014to support future global jurisdiction for limiting state sovereignty. This view was shared by Sugranyes and the Pax executive, represented in person by the organisation\u2019s Swiss Assistant Secretary for Europe, Bernard Ducret, a convinced Maritainist whose open clash with conservatives over anti-Communist strategy became the defining moment of the event.According to traditionalists, Maritain\u2019s \u2018doctrine of the outstretched hand\u2019 was based on \u2018false optimism\u2019, failing to recognise that Communism was \u2018a form of religion\u2019 and thus incapable of evolution. It was \u2018a work of the devil\u2019, not explicable by economic exploitation, but entirely \u2018passional\u2019. Lust for material rewards and \u2018intellectualism\u2019 were its sustenance.[CITATION-73] Ruiz Gim\u00e9nez did not use such language, preferring only to remind delegates that \u2018religious liberalism\u2019 had been condemned explicitly by the Holy See. In the absence of the French, Maritainist advocacy in favour of workers and the poor came from affiliates of the Federazione Universitaria Cattolica Italiana (FUCI), who affirmed private property to be subordinate to \u2018the common good\u2019.[CITATION-74] There were practical examples of this on the ground, including the Rome-based Istituto Cattolico di Attivit\u00e0 Sociali, directed by the anti-fascist lawyer, Vittorino Veronese, a Maritain disciple who became a leader of Pax\u2019s progressive restructuring in 1947, alongside Sugranyes and Millot.[CITATION-75] When it was announced that some young FUCI affiliates intended to accompany Italian Communist students to the World Student Congress, to be held in Prague in August 1946, tensions were brought to a head, prompting a Spanish delegate to demand that Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez read aloud from the 1937 encyclical, to the effect that Communism was intrinsically perverse and could not be collaborated with under any circumstances.[CITATION-76] The counter challenge came from Ducret, the Pax executive\u2019s Assistant Secretary, in an intervention of some moment which was not printed in Madrid\u2019s published congress proceedings.[CITATION-77] Voicing the feeling of the Fribourg executive, Ducret appealed for concerted, urgent and critical action on the Church\u2019s relation to the temporal world as the post-war dawned. Merely \u2018repeating constantly that Communism is the greatest enemy of the Catholic Church and of our civilization\u2019 was to set the discussion \u2018on a false and dangerous course\u2019 and, although he had no issue with papal declarations, he determined to make a stand \u2018\u2019 against the \u2018method\u2019 employed by those assembled:We have just read a passage from. You applaud with vehemence, and you think leaving this congress, with Communism definitively condemned, that you can rest. Well, no! Communism is out there and is watching you all. It will soon be at your home, dear South American friends \u2026 Do not fall asleep. Seek instead during this congress to know why our Catholicism has been left behind by numerous doctrines, and by Communism in particular. (Seek to know) what our weaknesses were, their causes \u2026 If our elders had sought to apply pontifical teachings in the social field, instead of applauding as you have just done, we might not need today to talk of Communism \u2026 You should therefore seek here the practical means to fight in your university, in your country, and, through Pax Romana, on the international level, against all doctrines.This coda, cautioning against \u2018doctrines\u2019, was surely intended to encompass fascism, a warning against alignment with Franco\u2019s authoritarian paternalist solution.[CITATION-78] The position of the Pax executive was clear, and yet the reading fromhad received a great ovation, as did the testimonies of exiled Eastern delegates to the martyrdom of Ukraine and Poland who blamed \u2018exaggerated intellectualism\u2019 among Catholics for the diffusion of Communism.[CITATION-79] Close encounters with perceived existential threats counted in arguing for a Church defended by impregnable nation-states and against \u2018intellectualising\u2019 the mysteries of the faith. The Spanish student, it was declared, \u2018knows Communism not only because he studies the encyclicals but through our martyrs\u2019.[CITATION-80] It was easy enough to believe that Spain had \u2018saved Europe\u2019 through a martyrdom which outshone all others in the 1930s and was on a par with the current suffering of Eastern Europe.[CITATION-81] Bearing witness was contrasted with the shortcomings of Catholic nuclei (progressives), \u2018in specific countries\u2019, who \u2018undervalued Spanish blood\u2019 and \u2018denied the mystery of martyrdom\u2019; they were themselves \u2018a mystery\u2019, obscured and cosseted by intellectual elitism.[CITATION-82] In the aftermath of the congress, both sides used Pax Romana as a channel to attempt to sway the Vatican. Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez cabled Rome, reaffirming Pax\u2019s unyielding adherence and identifying international condemnation of Spain with an alleged \u2018wholesale assault\u2019 on the Church. To confirm Pax\u2019s fealty, a papal audience was arranged for Spanish and South American delegates on route to the jubilee congress in Fribourg to be held in August.[CITATION-83] During the visit, mass was held among the sepulchres of the early martyrs in the Roman catacombs, an opportunity for Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez to extol in the Spanish press the offering made by \u2018God\u2019s soldiers of Spain\u2019 in resistance to atheism.[CITATION-84] The laying of the lips of these soldier-delegates upon the tombstones of the first Christians situated religious faith symbolically where it belonged: outside of time. It was an act consistent with an ethos of the Church\u2019s separateness from the rest of social life, a position that the mentors of Sugranyes had warned against during and after the civil war because of its political implications. In papal audiences between 1939 and 1943, the exiled Catalan archbishop Barraquer had in fact decried state exploitation in Spain of religious pilgrimages, processions and enthronements to legitimise the political charisma of \u2018men of destiny\u2019.[CITATION-85] And yet, at the same moment that Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was perpetuating Spain\u2019s \u2018crusade\u2019, Ducret was airing concern to the Pax executive about the Church\u2019s relation to Spain\u2019s \u2018total state\u2019, reinforcing the point that fixation on Soviet atheism had obscured the danger of \u2018totalitarian states\u2019 whichthe Church. The Maritainist concept of personalism, a philosophical motif for Sugranyes since 1937, was at the heart of Ducret\u2019s critique of regimes which assumed that God desires order and ideological truth so much that it \u2018takes precedence over the person\u2019.[CITATION-86] Social order in a Europe being reconstructed was a natural priority, but not at the expense of liberty. Ducret\u2014guided by Sugranyes and others\u2014recognised, moreover, that Franco\u2019s rule was opposed by the clergy in regions with a strong, separate, national identity.[CITATION-87] Appropriation of the faith in the interests of a peculiarly backward-looking sort of modernity thus set Spain apart and constituted an object lesson in what Catholic modernity shouldmean:The current illusion in Spain is to believe that Christianity is a \u2018successful\u2019 religious revolution: the salvation of man by man, rather than by God (and) a very clear nostalgia for good times where the message of Christ accepted by all completely penetrated and informed society, including the state \u2026 Thus the present is lost to the rescue of a past that does not really exist. It is for us to extract ourselves from this illusion.Ducret added that \u2018every state Church is a dependent Church\u2019; history showed it had \u2018never received any temporal support which ultimately did not demonstrate its weakness\u2019.[CITATION-88] The experiences of Sugranyes tallied with this analysis and informed his reforming efforts to re-shape Pax Romana, abetted by Ducret and other former anti-fascist activists, including Millot and Veronese. Among the first steps were the devising of new organisational structures, the formation of a secretariat for relations with UNESCO and the celebration of an intensive summer school on the theme of Christian Democracy.[CITATION-89] In the summer of 1946, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez had continued to laud Franco publicly as a saviour; however, less than a year later, he felt compelled privately to express regret for \u2018errors\u2019 committed during his presidency to the newly formed Pax executive, which by this time had Ramon Sugranyes at its centre.[CITATION-90] The Fribourg congress in August 1946 became the launch pad of the organisation\u2019s reconfiguration, addressing fundamental questions over Nazism and Franco\u2019s war which had been avoided by the Church. These questions had been encapsulated by Ducret\u2019s courageous statement only weeks before at the congress in Spain. Priorities to address in 1946\u20138 included the contradictions between confessional states and the modern world, the marking out of a position on universal human rights (and consequent limits upon national sovereignty) and the role of Catholics in a potentially federalised Europe. Intellectuals\u2014and the educated laity in general, conditioned by successive conflicts since 1936\u2014led responses during this denouement of Pax\u2019s internal struggle.Participation in the effusion of ideas at war\u2019s end called for a separate intellectual Pax section, alongside the student federation, as proposed first in 1945. By early 1947, a new bipartite structure was thus established: a student body (Mouvement International des Etudiants Catholiques: MIEC) and a section for \u2018those of the intellectual professions\u2019 (Mouvement International des Intellectuels Catholiques: MIIC).[CITATION-91] Swiss reformists headed the MIEC. Andr\u00e9 Florinetti, a member of the executive which had censured Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez for politicism, became its head. The first president of the MIIC was also Swiss\u2014the chancellor of Fribourg University, Hubert Aepli\u2014and Sugranyes became the intellectual section\u2019s first general-secretary (1946\u201358). A commission was established to draw up new statutes.[CITATION-92] Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez had been superseded, but the commission included another Francoist civil war veteran and Catholic Action activist, Francisco Sintes Obrador, who now sat alongside Sugranyes (the civil war exile), with two other anti-fascist disciples of Maritain: Roger Millot and Vittorino Veronese. When Sintes proposed limiting the reach of the laity by spelling out Pax\u2019s subordination to Rome, this was overridden. When he also objected to foregrounding the Maritainist \u2018requirements of Christian humanism\u2019, the wording was diplomatically amended to \u2018Christian and human values\u2019, but the progressive meaning and purpose were beyond doubt.[CITATION-93] The imperative was to align both new branches with the emerging global order, while enabling future critical engagement with competitors\u2014\u2018associations of a materialist character\u2019\u2014as well as resistance to those openly inspired by Communism.[CITATION-94] The founding conferences of the two nascent sections were staged simultaneously in Rome at Easter 1947 and hosted by Alcide de Gasperi, by this time Christian Democratic Prime Minister of Italy.[CITATION-95] The reformulated Pax statutes received formal papal approval and a high-ranking Cardinal Protector was appointed.[CITATION-96] All of this was symbolic of incipient change. In the light of his conspicuous absence from Pax assemblies since 1937, Maritain\u2019s key address to the Rome conferences signalled Pax\u2019s change of course, as did that of his, \u00c9tienne Gilson.[CITATION-97] The moment of the laity seemed to have arrived and could not be squandered. If Catholicism failed to place itself at the centre of modern society, Gilson declared, the temporal world might anyway appropriate ideas which were fundamentally Christian.[CITATION-98] Beyond the rarefied world of the public intellectual, the broader educated laity had a vital technical and educational role in modern life, as well as exercising \u2018political duties\u2019 as citizens. These professionals possessed \u2018a vocation gifted by God\u2019\u2014educators, doctors, engineers, jurists, industrial managers\u2014to lead what was imagined confidently as a \u2018spiritual regeneration of mankind\u2019.[CITATION-99] And yet the organisation\u2019s ambiguous position between philosophical idealism\u2014theoretically challenging the established social order\u2014and the expediencies of post-war politics, had not been resolved. In 1942 Maritain had already identified the tension between \u2018a constructive peace struggling through time toward man\u2019s emancipation\u2019 and politics as power, in the interests largely of \u2018the health of the state\u2019.[CITATION-100] Once the statutes were approved, Aepli stood aside, and Millot was elected president of the MIIC, alongside his friend Sugranyes. Veronese became vice-president. Millot was in an advantageous position because, through the Pax-affiliated CCIF, he was in Paris to attend the initial meetings of UNESCO, helping establish the Vatican\u2019s UN Coordinating Committee there. The twin sections of Pax were granted UNESCO consultative status as NGOs in July 1948. Like all Catholic bodies, Pax\u2019s charitable and intellectual brief was parallel to disseminating the faith and promoting the interests of the Church. But the aims of UNESCO fitted with papal advocacy of human solidarity on an international scale and Pax aimed to contribute means by which this could be achieved: intellectual and \u2018moral\u2019 co-operation, beyond political and economic arrangements.[CITATION-101] Gilson declared that Catholic intellectual co-action would be instrumental in reining in nationalism. Sugranyes echoed this idealism, the proper aim of Pax being \u2018to organise within the entire world the fraternity of spirits that places intelligence at the service of God\u2019.[CITATION-102] Maritain himself became head of the French delegation to UNESCO\u2019s general assembly in Mexico in 1947, urging Catholics to find common ground with others promoting humane reconstruction, regardless of creed.[CITATION-103] Veronese later served on the executive committee of UNESCO (1952\u20136), before becoming its Director General in 1958. Beside him, Pax\u2019s representative in South America between 1939 and 1945, the German Rudolph Salat, became head of the agency\u2019s Department of Cultural Activities, having been attached to Konrad Adenauer\u2019s government, first as head of cultural affairs of the diplomatic service in 1949 and then at the Vatican embassy. Much of this activity happened tangentially to national politics, of course, where Maritain\u2019s ideal \u2018civic fraternities\u2019 might have been realised in concrete terms. But dissemination of personalist ideas transnationally via intellectuals associated with Pax Romana helped confirm Christian Democratic leaders\u2019 commitment to parliamentary democracy after 1945 as the only political system compatible with Christian faith.[CITATION-104] Transnational connectivity had kept a spirit of anti-fascism alive since 1939 which broadened through Pax Romana after 1945 when the need to integrate socially and religiously those who may once have been swayed by extremism was recognised. Salat, for example, was acutely aware how his accumulated experience of wartime \u2018international lay apostleship\u2019 on behalf of Pax contrasted with the majority of male Germans of his generation who \u2018know nothing of foreign countries except as soldiers of occupation\u2019.[CITATION-105] In August 1948, the Pax executive produced a commentary on the draft of what became the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Although Catholics preferred the personalist term \u2018dignity\u2019 to the vocabulary of \u2018the rights of man\u2019, Sugranyes was convinced after discussion with Father Journet\u2014his mentor and confessor since 1937\u2014that it was natural to seek a \u2018convergence in practice\u2019 of human rights and the Catholic tradition with which he felt imbued. At the same time as Maritain insisted from the embassy at the Holy See that religion must respond to change in the temporal world, Sugranyes argued similarly that \u2018Natural Law\u2019 was adaptable to the movement of history, \u2018as moral consciousness progresses and society evolves\u2019.[CITATION-106] The 1948 Pax memorandum on the Declaration had to reconcile the opinions of many federated bodies, but it was predominantly positive, welcoming the emphasis on the human person, even if it lamented lack of specific attention to the right of the family to protection by the state.[CITATION-107] As a Catalan exile from Franco\u2019s Spain, Sugranyes had little cause to argue with support for political rights or the memorandum\u2019s call for limits to state sovereignty and advocacy of federalism. To Sugranyes, as an anti-Francoist\u2014and an anti-Communist\u2014some level of \u2018supra-national juridical guarantee of political liberty\u2019 was required.[CITATION-108] It was also desirable that where \u2018the historical development of a people leads to local self-government\u2019, the state should be decentralised.[CITATION-109] Through Pax Romana, he maintained\u2014with pan-European anti-Communism as a backdrop\u2014the production and exchange of cultural values constituted the basis for \u2018the political union of Europe\u2019.[CITATION-110] When he visited South American countries as General-Secretary of the MIIC in the summer of 1949, the guiding principle\u2014in contrast to Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez in 1946\u2014was not bounded by the ethno-imperial values of.[CITATION-111] Conscience prevented him from delivering such a message. But the purpose was in any case part of something broader and more present, inescapably related to the Cold War: to foster a socio-political programme to forestall the threat of \u2018totalitarianism\u2019 while tempering the \u2018excessive individualism\u2019 of US secular liberalism.[CITATION-112] This article has investigated the circumstances which motivated transnational connectivity among Catholic intellectuals during wartime. Competing anti-Communist strategies provided the basis of the complex and fractured landscape of the intellectual laity in the 1930s and 1940s. On the one hand, patriarchal conservatism cleaved towards protective nation-states; on the other, fraternalist pluralism was oriented towards civil society and regional identities. To this relatively familiar theme of the production and dissemination of religious and political ideas across boundaries the article adds a narrative about the absorption of such ideas at an intermediate level between the educated faithful in general and the elite of exalted public thinkers in particular. Two complementary approaches have been combined: first, a trans-war chronological framework which explores connections between convulsive events (here, the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War and its aftermath); and second, a spatial corroboration of these temporal connections via the parallel biographies of two significant individuals who crossed boundaries between and within nation states. By analysing the successive periods of Pax Romana\u2019s leadership by Joaqu\u00edn Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Ramon Sugranyes, corporate Catholic transnationalism has been balanced by an individualist \u2018molecular\u2019 focus on Catholicism as a universalist framework for lived experience as well as political commitment. The parameters of both men\u2019s responses were set by overlapping national and global Catholic communities, tangible as well as imagined. Yet their reactions were also necessarily adaptive to events in real time. Amid geopolitical calamities over which they had no control, and the dissemination of philosophical responses from public intellectuals, their previous spatially bounded perceptions and models of polities, cultures and even religion were outstripped.In 1967, when encouraged to reflect on the 1940s, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez pinpointed exchanges across borders during that decade as instrumental in his acquiring \u2018a much fuller consciousness that Spanish Catholicism was a province within world Catholicism\u2019.[CITATION-113] This was more than retrospective rationalising. His involvement with Pax Romana represented a dialogue beyond the nation-state, the Francoist \u2018National-Catholic\u2019 ideal. After 1945, the Franco government relied on a shared international Catholic identity as a means to legitimacy and survival. It is possible to interpret this as evidence of foreign acceptance of Francoism, confirming Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez simply as Franco\u2019s representative.[CITATION-114] But this ignores friction among political \u2018families\u2019 within the Spanish dictatorship and tends towards a monolithic view of the Church internationally. At the very moment of Pax Romana\u2019s 1946 congress in Spain, its figurehead, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, was being undermined, obliged to defend himself from Catholic critics close to power in Spain who believed he was clandestinely using foreign links to organise a Spanish Christian Democratic party to weaken the government.[CITATION-115] The congress had signalled the widening gulf between Spanish orthodoxy and those who aligned with post-1945 fraternalist modernisation. The Pax event in Spain had therefore only superficially represented the zenith of Francoism\u2019s relations with global Catholicism; in reality it marked a low point in the Spanish regime\u2019s international standing among Catholic intellectuals. Transnational links with Spanish Catholics subsequently recovered to a degree but only through the endeavours of Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and others from an increasingly humanist position which drew them further away from regime orthodoxy. Spanish Catholic intellectuals became more acceptable internationally in direct relation to their cautious departure from the repressive nation-statist essence of Francoism.By 1949, if not before, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was thinking pluralistically in political and religious terms which converged with those understood by exiles, such as Ramon Sugranyes. While ambassador to the Holy See, he had corresponded with the long-banished former Republican Interior Minister, \u00c1ngel Galarza, who in revolutionary Madrid in 1936 had intervened to save his life. The context of their communication on the Spanish political situation was the early Cold War, which from Galarza\u2019s point of view called for a \u2018grand Catholic Party, profoundly oriented towards social policy and tolerance\u2019.[CITATION-116] More than a decade earlier, Sugranyes had written similarly to Luigi Sturzo during the war in Spain: \u2018only a profoundly Christian social and political action will be able, after the end of the war, to bring peace\u2019.[CITATION-117] In May 1947, in the wake of consecutive catastrophic wars, he transposed this programme to the global level in addressing the Pax Romana community: \u2018By knowing each other better, by allowing ourselves to benefit from each other\u2019s experiences, we Catholics of the liberal professions from each country will become aware of the mission that awaits us within the modern world, for which we must begin by re-appropriating the very notion of \u201cChristianity\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-118] From 1947, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez helped encourage participants from \u00adoutside Spain\u2014including Sugranyes\u2014to attend the discussion group held each summer in the Basque city of San Sebasti\u00e1n to debate Spanish alignment with Catholics internationally. These \u2018Conversaciones Cat\u00f3licas Inter\u00adnacionales\u2019 were the brainchild of the humanist mathematician Carlos Santamar\u00eda, a Maritainist who had campaigned for a Basque university in the 1930s, as Sugranyes had done for Catalonia.[CITATION-119] The progressive nature of the themes discussed\u2014close parallels to those on the agenda of the reconfigured Pax Romana\u2014was unheard of in the context of the early Franco years and provoked preoccupation in Madrid\u2019s Foreign Ministry. When Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was made Education Minister by Franco in 1951, his attempt to liberalise the university system led to his dismissal. Non-integrist Catholics like him had been useful in government (especially foreign affairs) since 1945 but they had not been able to re-shape the Franco state in their own image. Shortly after the dismissal of Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, notice was given by Pope John XXIII of the Second Vatican Council. Sugranyes and Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez came together among the invited lay assessors. When asked in 1958 what he most hoped would be achieved, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez pointedly stated the most basic fundaments of post-1945 Catholic modernity, as lacking in Spain: revision of Church\u2013state relations (\u2018consonant with present historical circumstances\u2019) and greater dialogue between the ecclesiastical sphere and the secular world.[CITATION-120] During the 1960s he presided again over Pax Romana and became a leading figure of the barely tolerated intellectual opposition in Spain, bringing together Christian Democrats from Spain and the regions with social democrats."

    "text": "At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, many French commentators doubted that France had the strength to withstand the trials of war. Yet the national mobilisation for war was an indisputable success that surprised military planners and political leaders alike. Despite inauspicious beginnings and the unprecedented material and human costs of war, France held out, and the Republican nation-state emerged victorious and to a large extent reinforced by the war. However, the subsequent failure to mobilise successfully in 1939\u201340 begs the question of the nature and transformation of French patriotism in the First World War. Interestingly, in a field characterised by its vibrant, sophisticated and highly contentious debates, French historians appear to have skirted around the problem of patriotic mobilisation. This article reconsiders this question by investigating social mobilisation in the country\u2019s southern periphery, focusing on the town of B\u00e9ziers. It underlines the need to locate patriotism by considering its valence in the particular social and geographic contexts that determined the war experience at the front or at home. It also suggests the necessity to re-politicise the idea of national sentiment while maintaining the necessary distinction between patriotism and nationalism. Finally, it argues that the analysis of wartime mobilisation in France must be part of a larger reflection on the mobilisation of space and place in the era of the Great War.At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, France was still coming to terms with the political, social and economic transformations which had defined the history of modern Europe since the late eighteenth-century. As \u2018Children of the Revolution\u2019, the French were, in the first instance, continuing to deal with a host of institutional and ideological questions that the establishment of the Third Republic in 1870 had not settled.[CITATION-1] In particular, the relationship between the state, the Catholic Church and the army was still characterised by the fraught and divisive debate over national identity and political loyalty that the Dreyfus Affair had dramatically laid bare. In the meantime, economic modernisation and internal migration were slowly but surely transforming rural society. Finally, French leaders and political observers continued to bemoan unpromising demographic trends; these worries underpinned heated discussions about national decline in the challenging European context created by German unification and the crushing military defeat of 1871. Across the political spectrum many, such as Louis Suquet, a Parisian engineer, doubted that France had the material, institutional and cultural strengths to withstand the trials of war:As to patriotic matters, scepticism and disillusionment were in fashion. We believed that revolution would follow war; that the mobilisation would be sabotaged; in short, we were convinced of our incapacity.[CITATION-2] Yet the national mobilisation for war in 1914 was an indisputable success that surprised military planners and political leaders alike.[CITATION-3] In spite of inauspicious beginnings and the unprecedented material and human costs of the conflict, France overcame a series of crises, including the mutinies of 1917, and eventually saw the conflict through to the end. The Republican nation-state emerged victorious and, by and large, reinforced by the war.[CITATION-4] However, in view of the polarisation of French political and social life in the inter-war years which followed, and of the subsequent failure to enact another successful mobilisation in 1939\u201340, one may legitimately wonder about the nature and strength of French patriotism in the First World War.[CITATION-5] To a large extent, it has been the need to make sense of the resilience of French society in the face of industrial warfare which has catalysed First World War studies in France since the late 1970s. But while the French historiography of the Great War remains dynamic, a long-standing scholarly controversy over the nature of a specific \u2018war culture\u2019 has led to wartime mobilisation being analysed in misleadingly dichotomous terms as a process shaped either by consent or by coercion.[CITATION-6] Typified by two schools of interpretation that respectively stress either popular consent to the war or the coercive power of the state apparatus, this debate continues to be framed in terms of opposition between cultural and social historians.[CITATION-7] As a result, French patriotic mobilisation remains poorly understood.This article aims to move past the artificial impasse created by the existing historiographical controversy and to suggest instead that urban history can provide key insights into the dynamics of mobilisation. The argument is centred on a case-study, that of B\u00e9ziers in southern France. It offers a definition of patriotism that accounts for the expression of distinct territorial identities. To do this, it builds on pragmatic approaches to social history and social identities and stresses in particular the conflictual nature of patriotic mobilisation.[CITATION-8] The article argues indeed that it was the very contested and pluralist nature of wartime mobilisation that was the key to the success of the French war effort.At the heart of what used to be known as the\u2014the Red South\u2014B\u00e9ziers encapsulated the political culture of a region where a strong local identity had traditionally been seen as a challenge to processes of centralisation and to the national state. It is therefore an appropriate test-case for the decentred approach to national mobilisation that this article propounds. The fact that the town had witnessed a dramatic stand-off between the state and the army at a somewhat earlier date, in 1907, makes it important to examine the articulation of patriotism and local repertoires of contention before 1914. By virtue of its position at the heart of winemaking industry, B\u00e9ziers also allows us to consider the interaction of town and country: the expression of urban and rural responses to the war. The article scrutinises the wartime mobilisation of southern identities and approaches the military experience of the locality. It also highlights the ethical dimensions of the process of patriotic mobilisation and finally underlines the specificities of urban wartime politics.The intensity of the historiographical dispute over the French war effort in 1914\u201318 has obscured the fact that protagonists on both sides of the argument paradoxically share what one may call\u2014for lack of a better term\u2014a \u2018consensualist\u2019 view of wartime mobilisation. Indeed, the idea that wartime mobilisation stemmed from theand from a rather improbable national consensus remains surprisingly prevalent across the divide drawn by the controversy. For St\u00e9phane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker and many others, national mobilisation was the effect and product of a patriotic consensus crystallised by war violence into a specific \u2018war culture\u2019.[CITATION-9] For R\u00e9my Cazals, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rousseau, Nicolas Offenstadt and Andr\u00e9 Loez, strikes and mutinies demonstrate that national mobilisation was only made possible and maintained by the exercise of state coercion and propaganda.[CITATION-10] Though they draw opposite conclusions from the French war experience, both interpretations therefore seem to share the same premise; namely that only national consensus could underpin wartime national mobilisation. Both sides in this debate also inadvertently conspire to neglect patriotism as a category of political analysis. On the one hand, proponents of the \u2018war culture\u2019 paradigm rightly stress the symbolic and emotional dimensions of \u2018national sentiment\u2019.[CITATION-11] Yet, in doing so, they tend to detach nationhood from the social and political contexts in which it was tested. Drawing on anthropology, literary scholarship and art history, they also rarely mobilise the categories of political history, which were key to the works of an earlier generation represented by Jean-Jacques Becker and Antoine Prost.[CITATION-12] Meanwhile, the protagonists on the other side of the argument have long seemed reluctant to evoke patriotism, for fear perhaps of finding evidence of it.[CITATION-13] In any case, they appear unwilling or unable to reconcile the existence of social or regional tensions with the possibility of commitment to national defence.[CITATION-14] Surprisingly in this context, French historians of the First World War have rarely engaged with historical and social scientific approaches to nationalism and nationhood in a sustained and critical fashion.[CITATION-15] They have indeed often conflated nationalism, nationhood and patriotism. Nicolas Mariot\u2019s recent study of the frontline encounter between intellectuals and working-class soldiers illustrates the perils of such confusion. Mariot sets out to challenge the idea that the experience of combat had welded estranged social groups into a frontline community. To do so, he relies on the testimonies of combatant intellectuals to argue that the resilience of working-class and rural soldiers cannot be taken as evidence of patriotism. Mariot underlines the incapacity of rank-and-file participants to express their commitment to national defence in the idealistic terms favoured by intellectuals and nationalists. This, in his view, demonstrates the irrelevance of patriotism as an interpretative factor.[CITATION-16] Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rousseau also addresses this question. As in Mariot\u2019s study, the conviction that state coercion accounted for the tenacity of French soldiers underpins his central argument.[CITATION-17] Rousseau does, however, struggle to reconcile this position with the frequent expressions of patriotism among the French working classes. He dismisses the language of patriotism as simply an expression of social conformity in a time of censorship and propaganda; however, one could argue that this overstates the efficiency of the state\u2019s police apparatus. It also suppresses the voices of subaltern participants in the conflict or, at best, suggests they would better be disregarded as insincere and therefore useless as historical sources.[CITATION-18] Such positions are all the more problematic in that they endorse\u2014unwittingly perhaps\u2014nationalist and conservative interpretations of the. This temporary party-political truce imposed in response to the German invasion was named after the phrase coined by the conservative President of the Republic, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, in his message to the National Assembly on 4 August 1914. A few hours later L\u00e9on Jouhaux, leader of the, symbolically sanctioned it over the fresh grave of Jean Jaur\u00e8s, the Socialist leader murdered by a nationalist activist on the eve of mobilisation. Initially understood as a contingent truce between political factions in a national emergency, thewas soon deployed by conservatives and nationalists to denounce any political contestation or social movement as unpatriotic.[CITATION-19] Subsequently condemned by anti-militarists and pacifists as an exploitative sham, thewas never anything more than a rhetorical device. It is therefore particularly problematic for historians to use it as a benchmark in their assessment of wartime social mobilisation. For to do so entails that they accept, in the face of historical evidence, three highly contested claims made by French nationalists since the end of the nineteenth century:[CITATION-20] first, that they were the ultimate and exclusive arbiters of patriotism; secondly, that patriotism and nationalism were synonymous; and thirdly, that patriotism was first demonstrated in wartime by the unquestioning acceptance of the authority of the state apparatus and of the armed forces in particular.By contrast, this article rejects the misleading confusions between nationalism and patriotism and between theand patriotic mobilisation. It sets out to study popular patriotism in its own terms and contends that urban history offers a productive way to situate patriotic mobilisation in the local and national contexts in which it took place. Indeed, this article argues that wartime patriotism ought to be considered as part of a larger reflection on the political and cultural geography of France in the era of the Great War. Historians of the First World War long assumed that the process of nationalisation of the French polity had reached its apex in August 1914. In recent years, however, a string of works on France and Germany have demonstrated that nation-making and processes of centralisation had not entailed the withering of local identities.[CITATION-21] The urban history of wartime mobilisation offers a fruitful way to study the articulation of national and infra-national identities and to rescue patriotism from the idealistic and exclusionary definition that nationalists sought to impose upon their contemporaries and historians alike. Moreover, this article suggests that a decentred approach to national mobilisation, focusing on peripheral and, in this case, southern regions of France, may shed critical light on the nature and process of national mobilisation.The distinctions between nationalism and patriotism, between theand patriotic mobilisation are not simply of relevance to continuing historiographical debate. In present-day commemorative contexts, they are also critical if historians are to challenge successfully the growing assertion of regionalist and essentialist definitions of social identities that threaten to undermine public understanding of the conflict. It is indeed striking to see how the centenary of the war and the flurry of activities, events and publications it generated, reactivated conventional as well as regional narratives of victimisation. These also built on and appropriated the kind of rhetoric deployed by those activists and intellectuals who have rightly been calling for France to reckon with the crimes and moral legacies of its imperialist ventures.[CITATION-22] Like those who legitimately agitate for the integration of colonial soldiers into the national memory of the war, regionalist writers have evoked soldiers of Languedoc, Corsica, Brittany or the Basque country as sacrificial victims of the French centralising and nationalising project.[CITATION-23] In this regard, France is just another example of a multicultural society grappling with the memory of wars fought in the name of the nation-state. Yet, historians of the Breton or southern experiences of the war also lend credence to such regionalist interpretations when they appear to endorse theas an ideal-type of national mobilisation.[CITATION-24] This article draws on a rich scholarly field in which historians of the urban experience of the war have, over the last two decades, framed their contributions in both local and comparative terms.[CITATION-25] It also builds on the studies of wartime urban governance published in the inter-war period under the aegis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.[CITATION-26] As we shall see, urban history does indeed underline the conflictual nature of social mobilisation for war and demonstrates that theis a poor descriptor for that process. For local social movements and conflicts did not merely demonstrate the frailty of the consensus stipulated by the prescriptions of nationalism. Instead, urban contention constituted a critical mediation of the war experience, whereby national and infra-national identities were asserted, mobilised and played out on the urban stage. Urban civil societies thus ensured, to a large extent, the success of national mobilisation in France. It is also at the urban level that the contingent, ongoing and contested nature of these mobilisations appears most clearly. To look at the urban therefore sheds critical light on both the nature and mobilisation of patriotic cultures in First World War France.By adopting this local focus\u2014on B\u00e9ziers\u2014we can document the significance of infra-national identities and repertoires of contention in enough detail to scrutinise the articulation of urban, regional and national processes of mobilisation. This question of differing scales of analysis is relevant to the study of all belligerent societies. It is, however, of particular importance for historians of the French Third Republic (1871\u20131940), whose source base reflects, and is determined by, the political structures of this monist and universalist political regime. As a result, histories of France have often echoed and reinforced the political hierarchy and cultural distinctions that the centralised Republic conventionally made between the nation, theand the localities and municipalities. For all their richness, departmental studies rely on sources produced by and for the prefectoral administration which held authority over all civilian functionaries in the area.[CITATION-27] In narrowing the analytical focus down to the urban, this article does not seek to confirm or invalidate other national and regional studies. It does, however, aim to show how the experience of the meridional periphery may illuminate the larger process of national mobilisation when we combine different scales of analysis.[CITATION-28] On 21 June 1907, soldiers of the 17th Infantry Regiment left their barracks in Agde and marched to B\u00e9ziers in protest against the suppression of the local winegrowers\u2019 revolt. Their mutiny was the climax of a crisis which had been convulsing the southern part of France since March of that year. The mutineers improvised a billet in the heart of the town, where they were photographed, holding the butts of their rifles aloft, surrounded by townsmen and women. This remains, to this day, one of the most enduring images conjured up by the name of B\u00e9ziers. The mutiny of the soldiers of the 17th went on to gain iconic status in the French pacifist tradition, thanks to a song composed soon after the events by Mont\u00e9hus.[CITATION-29] These soldiers, recruited and stationed in the local area, had come to embody the unreliable nature of the southern regions, whose local identity was deemed to threaten the integrity of the French nation-state. The challenge they so dramatically issued to the military authorities underlines the problematic nature of the relationship between the expression of peripheral and national identities in France at the turn of the twentieth century. When the First World War broke out, however, B\u00e9ziers and its surrounding district () responded unreservedly to the call to arms. In this particular context, the indisputable success of national mobilisation calls into question conventional interpretations of the processes of the creation of the nation. It also invites us to rethink our understanding of patriotism and to place wartime mobilisation in the broader context of social mobilisation and contention in the early twentieth century.B\u00e9ziers, known as the \u2018wine capital\u2019, stood at the heart of a region entirely dedicated to wine-growing and was a major centre of the national and European wine markets.[CITATION-30] A few indicators illustrate the extent to which the economic destiny of the town was inseparable from the success of the local intoxicant. In 1914, the department of the H\u00e9rault, where B\u00e9ziers is located, accounted for more than a quarter of the national wine production (27.9 per cent). In theof B\u00e9ziers, vines covered 77.7 per cent of the land and generated 90.4 per cent of local revenue. 67.5 per cent of the municipality\u2019s area was devoted to wine-growing.[CITATION-31] The town\u2019s dependency on the wine market had first been dramatically demonstrated between 1873 and 1881 when phylloxera\u2014a vine pest\u2014destroyed a large part of the vineyards of southern France. Eventually restored thanks to the import of Californian grafts, the local winemaking industry then took a decidedly capitalist turn. Although the modernisation of the local economy ushered in a prosperous \u2018Golden Age\u2019 in the last ten years of the nineteenth century, it also entrenched for decades to come the town\u2019s dependency on the wine market; a vulnerability which was to be illustrated by the 1907 uprising.[CITATION-32] By 1900, the dominant political culture in B\u00e9ziers revealed a high degree of acculturation to national political life despite its strong oppositional tradition. The town enjoyed a well-established reputation for political radicalism: on several occasions, conflicts had pitted the local community against national institutions. Yet, this radical heritage, mobilised effectively in times of local or national crisis, contributed to a significant extent to resolving apparent tensions and contradictions between the assertion and sustainment of local identity and the consolidation of the nation-state.The dominant political culture in B\u00e9ziers was typical of the, a large swathe of the southern part of France where an advanced form of radical republicanism held sway and where socialism and syndicalism had both developed precociously. B\u00e9ziers, in particular, was a secularist stronghold where local progressives celebrated a tradition of opposition to the centralised state, exemplified in the resistance of the town and the surrounding villages to the 1851 coup which had inaugurated the Second Empire. Violently repressed by troops loyal to Louis Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, this uprising ended with the deaths of seventy people in the streets of B\u00e9ziers and the deportation and execution of a number of activists. By the turn of the century, however, the local Radical Party, supported by the influential Masonic lodges, illustrated the conservative evolution of the regime: the party now became identified with the middle and upper-middle classes and the established political and social order. The town\u2019s(MP), Louis Lafferre (1861\u20131929) embodied what many deemed to be the drift to the right of the Radical Party he had co-founded in 1901. Lafferre could nonetheless rely on the staunch militant secularism of many of his constituents to thwart the rising Socialist challenge. A growing presence in the associational landscape, the Socialists had adopted an idiosyncratic positioning, determined by the local socio-economic conditions. In fact, up until the 1920s, the structure of landownership in the area hampered the development of a truly collectivist and revolutionary programme, for most agricultural labourers also enjoyed the benefits of private ownership.These socio-economic characteristics accounted for the evolution and balance of the local political forces. In 1907, the crisis had revealed that territorial forms of identities were not simply defined by geography and community life, but by a common dependence on the winemaking industry. As a result, the revolt of thepitted the populations of the south against the government and forced a redefinition of political allegiances in town and countryside alike. Though Lafferre\u2019s parliamentary seat in B\u00e9ziers remained safe, a group of independent radicals and socialists standing for \u2018communal interests\u2019 defeated his allies in the subsequent municipal elections. Meanwhile, right-wing organisations in B\u00e9ziers were so weak that they teetered on the brink of irrelevance. The reaction of their mouthpiece,, to the election of the Socialist \u00c9douard Barthe in the town\u2019s second constituency shows that, by 1914, the defence of the wine industry had become the over-arching principle around which local political life revolved. Despite its staunch Catholicism and virulent anti-republicanism,could not help paying tribute to Barthe, whom it judged had \u2018the right to be proud of [his] success, for one must admit that he ensured it through his boundless dedication to the cause of winemaking\u2019.[CITATION-33] Eugen Weber\u2019s classic work on late nineteenth-century France likened the means by which the masses were transformed into the French nation to a process of colonisation:We are talking about the process of acculturation: the civilization of the French by urban France, the disintegration of local cultures by modernity and their absorption into the dominant civilization of Paris and the schools.[CITATION-34] However,Weber, the experience of B\u00e9ziers and many other towns and cities across the country demonstrates that local identities withstood the forces of capitalist and bureaucratic modernisation and were still relevant as late as 1914. But how did these populations articulate their urban, local, regional and national identities? The study of social movements such as the 1907 crisis in the south provides an answer to this question. It also reveals how the politics of place operated in the decades before and during the First World War.The 1907 crisis resulted, quite simply, from the overproduction of poor quality wine that the market could no longer absorb. As wine-growers had given priority to yield over quality, wine prices fell dramatically. The southern vineyards were therefore in a constant state of crisis between 1901 and 1909. Imports from Algeria and the fraudulent production of wine (particularly by adulteration with sugar) offered convenient explanations for the woes of the winemaking. After a 1905 law had lowered tax on sugar, however, fraudsters and the northern sugar beet growers were singled out for condemnation, while the state\u2019s inaction was increasingly perceived as hostile indifference. The crisis came to a head on 11 March 1907 when a delegation of wine-growers from the small village of Argelliers met with a parliamentary inquiry commission. Thenceforth, the protests, demonstrations and meetings across southern France grew exponentially. On 12 May, 120,000 people converged on B\u00e9ziers, and on 9 June, half a million protestors brought their grievances into the streets of Montpellier, the regional capital city. The demonstrators accused fraudsters and beet growers in the north of putting their very livelihood in jeopardy and called upon the state to protect winemakers. The interpellation of the national authorities took a dramatic turn when the Argelliers Committee asked wine-growers and their supporters to withhold from paying their taxes, and asked the municipal assemblies to resign in protest at the Republic\u2019s inaction. A month earlier, a riot had already forced the mayor of B\u00e9ziers to resign. On 19 June in Narbonne, the army\u2019s intervention left protesters mourning the first victim of the revolt. Two days later, the 17th Infantry Regiment mutinied in B\u00e9ziers and seemingly threatened to transform a social movement into a fully fledged insurrection. Clemenceau, the head of the government, cunningly destabilised the movement\u2019s leadership, increased the military presence in the south and finally restored public order. The movement gradually ran out of steam after the passing of an anti-fraud law on 29 June.Legitimately concerned about the state of the local industry, protesters expressed a deeper anxiety: they feared economic depression would ultimately lead to the disappearance of their way of life. This was, in their eyes, no less than a life-and-death struggle, an existential fight that cut across classes and over-rode social and political antagonism. As the Socialist mayor of Narbonne, Ernest Ferroul, put it on 16 June 1907:Forgetting our fratricidal wars and whatever has divided us until now, we are defending the native land, the nourishing soil and its products. Is it not legitimate? When the black flag flies over our town halls, when we are demanding Right and Justice, one is sniggering, saying we are reactionaries. We are not monarchists, opportunists, radicals, or socialists anymore; we are nothing but Southerners who demand the right to live.[CITATION-35] Unity was the order of the day and the leaders of the movement as well as professional organisations insisted on fostering class collaboration. For the majority of demonstrators concurred on one fundamental point: it was up to the unitary Republic to save her southern constituents. Even where Occitan appeared to supplant French as the language of contention, such vocal assertion of regional identity did not entail a rejection of the universalist Republic.[CITATION-36] The regionalist interpretation of the 1907 events gained a new vigour in the 1970s when Occitanist organisations rose from the ashes of earlier regionalist movements.[CITATION-37] In these post-1968 reconstructions, even though the mutiny of the 17th Infantry Regiment had only lasted a day, it assumed a paradigmatic value: here was a regiment largely made up of men born and bred around B\u00e9ziers, who had stood up to the coercive machine of the nation-state to demonstrate where their loyalty lay by refusing to suppress the revolt of their kith and kin. Regionalists, though, remain as misleading as Eugen Weber, who refused to acknowledge that the events of 1907 provided a corrective to his modernising model. In many ways, the protesters had indeed demonstrated their acculturation to the national and Republican political culture. But the mutiny, as well as the resignation of municipal councils across the region, also illustrated the age-old tension between legality and legitimacy. For popular sovereignty was not here understood in the conventional terms of Republican universalism: the nation-state was not the exclusive object of political loyalty and never fully subsumed other territorial forms of political identities. The revolt showed that the legitimacy of the Republican state was dependent upon its capacity to represent the interests of its constituent parts. Republicanism, in this context, cannot be reduced to the formal, universalist ideological construction promoted by the intellectual elites of the Third Republic since its inception. It is rather better understood as a specific type of the democratic political culture which defined the legitimate forms of political contention and claim-making.[CITATION-38] The mutineers had indeed demonstrated in the most dramatic fashion that popular sovereignty had communal roots which Republican institutions, including the army, could simply not afford to ignore. Clemenceau, himself a representative of a southern constituency in the Var, patently understood that the repressive measures he had used the previous year against striking miners in the north were unlikely, on their own, to quell the revolt of the south.[CITATION-39] While mutineers faced the rigours of military justice and deportation to a penal colony in Tunisia, Clemenceau also deployed his political guile to charm and discredit the leadership of the movement.Interestingly, the years between the mutiny and the outbreak of war did not see a deterioration of the relationship between the army and the local community. The overwhelming dominance of independent radicals and moderate socialists in B\u00e9ziers and the, combined with the structural weakness of the Catholic and the nationalist right, already explained why the Dreyfus Affair did not ignite local political life here while it inflamed and divided large swathes of the country. In 1913, in a context now marked by rising international tensions, the proposed reform of military recruitment and the extension of compulsory military service to three years\u2014the so-called \u2018Three-Year Law\u2019\u2014met with widespread opposition in B\u00e9ziers, where radicals and socialists shared the substance, if not the tone of their opposition.[CITATION-40] In keeping with the strategic principles articulated by Jean Jaur\u00e8s in, local socialists objected to the proposed reform but protested their patriotism and commitment to national defence.[CITATION-41] The campaign for the 1914 parliamentary elections then provided further evidence of the convergence of local radicals and socialists on defence and military matters, while the nationalists remained too weak to force a substantive, let alone controversial, debate on the issue.[CITATION-42] In B\u00e9ziers, as across most of the, socialism remained akin to an advanced form of Republicanism; a commitment to building a social-democratic regime which would no more challenge private property than it would question the necessity of national defence.Historians of First World War Europe are now agreed that the outbreak of war in 1914 did not lead to an eruption of nationalist enthusiasm. They have built on Jean-Jacques Becker\u2019s seminal study of French public opinion which demonstrated that there was little consensus beyond a resigned commitment to a war of national defence.[CITATION-43] The conflict was nonetheless to be a protracted trial of the nations as it challenged the very fabric of the belligerent societies. In B\u00e9ziers, as in other towns, the modalities of social mobilisation in 1914\u20131918 therefore shed light on the patriotic practices elicited by the war effort: the support of local military units, assistance to war victims, various charitable initiatives, and the commemoration of military service. Urban history allows us to scrutinise the language as well as the performance of patriotism as sacrifice, citizenship and philanthropy. It shows that wartime mobilisation ran across and along the boundaries of multiple social and cultural spheres. It reveals the plurality of territorial identities and the relevance and complexity of the many co-existing senses of belonging that affected and were the hallmarks of the commitment to the national war effort.In towns and cities across the belligerent nations, urban elites reflected and shaped the social responses to the conflict. The wartime discourses and iconography produced by civic authorities, newspapers and voluntary organisations show how the main symbols of local identity were used to stress that victory would belong to the urban community as well as to the nation. Wartime systems of representations thus rested on a process of acculturation, on the appropriation of national narratives through specific cultural codes of relevance, in this case, to urban and rural populations in and around B\u00e9ziers. Indeed wartime social mobilisation demonstrates that local and peripheral identities were neither self-contained nor subsumed under one single level of governance, be that municipal or departmental. It also shows the willingness of local representatives of the nation-state to draw on these specific cultural resources for the benefit of national solidarity.In B\u00e9ziers, the vision of the war offered to the local community fell into line with a national mobilisation the \u2018totalising logic\u2019 of which enlisted the cultural, moral and ideological commitment of each nation to fight an uncivilised enemy to its capitulation. Defeat was not merely construed in military and strategic terms but was identified as synonymous with the end of one\u2019s culture, identity and way of life. The dominant discourses on the war therefore presented the conflict as a defensive one imposed on France and Britain by German aggression.[CITATION-44] As Victor Gelly, the deputy secretary of the local branch of the Socialist Party (the SFIO, or French Section of the Workers\u2019 International) wrote in a letter to the deputy prefect of the town:At this painful and distressing hour, the socialist branch of B\u00e9ziers wishes to do all its duty for the defence of the territory of our fatherland: the glorious French Republic \u2026 We are joining the sole party currently in existence in France: the party of National Defence. Long live the Republic![CITATION-45] Beyond conservative and nationalist groups, the majority of local socialists concurred with Radicals in presenting the Entente as the last bulwark against the German autocracy and militarism that was threatening democracy. In other words, besides the denunciation of a barbaric enemy and the evocation of German \u2018atrocities\u2019, the liberal justification of the conflict was in accordance with the dominant political culture and such ideological alignment certainly strengthened its purchase among the town\u2019s population. But the representation of the threat posed by the enemy also revealed the specifically local dimensions of the martial involvement of the population of B\u00e9ziers. Since the war was ultimately waged to preserve everyday values, French elites immediately resorted to some specific figures to underline the mobilisation of urban communities. Local cultural codes were thus used in the debasement of the enemy and underpinned the local vision of the intrinsically inferior German.In B\u00e9ziers, the organisers of charity days turned to the main symbols of local identity, namely vine and wine, to stress that victory would belong to the local community as well as to the nation. This was most clearly illustrated by the poster designed to promote the \u2018Journ\u00e9e de l\u2019H\u00e9rault\u2019, a departmental charity day. The event was organised by the Prefect, the representative of the centralised state in the, along with municipalities and the main departmental charitable organisations.In a somewhat traditional depiction of the rapacious and barbaric \u2018Boche\u2019, the enemy is defeated by Bacchus and a jolly \u2018Poilu\u2019, both sitting astride a wine barrel.[CITATION-46] Here the opposition is made blatant between the wine-drinking southern Frenchman and the beer-drinking, grape-treading German. This imagery spoke to regional populations beyond the confines of the town. The presence of Bacchus himself evoked the winemaking industry which supported the economy of much of southern France. Furthermore, the barrel was drawn in conformity with the model favoured by regional winemakers and merchants. The organisers also tailored their message to specific urban populations and produced and sold badges carrying B\u00e9ziers\u2019 coat of arms.The significance of this charity day also rested in the role played by the Prefect and his deputy, the, in each. As local representatives of the centralised, unitary Republic, these senior civil servants were tasked with the systematic monitoring and occasional suppression of anti-Republican activity, not least among the radical Catholic and anti-militarist milieus. In wartime, their mission was to preserve and foster national unity. Yet they also proved willing exponents and skilful interpreters of the very peripheral identities and communities that the governing regime, in theory, refused to acknowledge. They were clearly alive to the necessity to recognise and to articulate the subtle distinctions that made up urban, rural and departmental identities. B\u00e9ziers and the H\u00e9rault were not exceptional\u2014this process was replicated across the country. In several departments, including the Orne, Var, Vend\u00e9e and the Puy-de-D\u00f4me, the prefectoral administration deployed the symbols of local identities in support of the national war effort. This was most clearly the case in regions where the administrative subdivisions such as theoverlapped with communities with a distinctive identity. The latter was then evoked through the representation of the local landscape and environment as in the Orne, the Var or the Vend\u00e9e,[CITATION-47] the depiction of provincial garb,[CITATION-48] or references to local ancient heroes such as Vercingetorix in the Puy-de-D\u00f4me[CITATION-49] . By contrast, in places where no obvious territorial sense of belonging coincided with the departmental level of governance, the organisers of charity days settled for a generic, often feminine, image of a charity worker.[CITATION-50] Where attested, peripheral identities played an important role in the grammar of French patriotic mobilisation. Artists and publishers involved in designing and manufacturing the iconographic and material support for charity days responded to the demands of this particular market. In fact, Adolphe Willette (1857\u20131926) and \u00c9douard Devambez (1844\u20131923), the illustrator and the printer-publisher who produced the poster for the Journ\u00e9e de l\u2019H\u00e9rault, had carried out a large number of such commissions across the country. However, the Prefect of the H\u00e9rault rejected the printer\u2019s suggestion that he should use the conventional patriotic design chosen by his counterpart in the Sarthe. Indeed, in a letter dated 25 July 1916, the Prefect reiterated his insistence on the use of local symbols and references.[CITATION-51] The utilisation of specific local schemas of representation ensured a perfect understanding and reception of wartime propaganda which translated directly into charitable contributions. Indeed, the Journ\u00e9e de l\u2019H\u00e9rault was the most successful charity day held in B\u00e9ziers and its arrondissement during the war, and eventually raised 11,126.80 Francs in the town and 28,064.55 Francs in the arrondissement. More telling perhaps is the fact that the town\u2019s contribution per head on that day (FF 21.80) was more than twice the average across the other nine charity days organised during the war (FF 10.38).[CITATION-52] The success of patriotic days that explicitly pandered to civic pride cannot merely be dismissed as the result of \u2018patriotic marketing\u2019 as it has been argued.[CITATION-53] National elites could not impose participation from above and their involvement does not explain why such initiatives raised more money than other charitable events. In fact, their success underlined the potency of urban and regional identities in the process of mobilisation. During the war, local communities established an order of priorities that stressed, for instance, the necessity of propping up their local economy and of supporting the towns\u2019 traders at the expense of their national or regional rivals. In B\u00e9ziers, L\u00e9on Dupr\u00e9, the local correspondent of the regional newspaperand a key figure in radical and freemason circles, wrote to the Deputy Prefect and the commander of the 16th Military Region to denounce the contract awarded in September 1915 to sheepskin traders in Toulouse before B\u00e9ziers businesses had even had the chance to submit their tenders.[CITATION-54] A more significant example was the provision of assistance to war victims, which was not only organised at the local level but was also primarily directed toward the members of the community who had been directly affected by the war:Your wounded, your sick, your mutilated, your blind, your refugees, your orphans, your prisoners, your dead: all those who sacrificed themselves to the common cause, the greatest and noblest of causes, have faith in the greatness of your soul, whose beneficence they have already enjoyed.[CITATION-55] These discriminatory processes were not a crude expression of local selfishness that, after all, might have been vindicated by the scarcity of available resources. Such discriminatory processes actually structured the local commitment to national defence.Urban and peripheral identities and solidarities accounted in no small part for the plurality of the war cultures which sustained national mobilisation. More often than not, the language and practices of wartime patriotism eschewed the lofty and abstract vocabulary of nationalism. Instead, the defence of the nation was commonly articulated in communitarian terms and framed in the language of urban, class or religious solidarities.[CITATION-56] Patriotic mobilisation reflected the lived experience of the social ties and interdependences that bound the local, urban and national populations together in peacetime. Despite its prominence during the conflict, the rhetoric of patriotic orators offered an abstract and ultimately misleading view of the country\u2019s cohesion. This war of national defence was not construed in the ideological terms of nationalism, but as a personal battle for the safety of one\u2019s family and home. The very conventional nature of national sentiment\u2014the mundanity of patriotism\u2014accounts for its resilience in the face of industrial warfare.Enrolled in mass armies, the combatants of the First World War remained, first and foremost, civilians in uniform.[CITATION-57] As a result, the solidarity between the military front and home front remained a problematic issue throughout the conflict. Deemed critical to the cohesion of belligerent societies by political and military leaders alike, it remains central to current historiographical debates. In France, as in other belligerent countries, local identity enabled soldiers and civilians to mediate their experience and to conjure up their solidarity. From a comparative standpoint however, it is critical to stress how the organisation of military recruitment affected the local mediations of the wartime national experience.In France, conscription was part and parcel of the national Revolutionary heritage, the modern manifestation of the, the republican concept of the nation in arms.[CITATION-58] Though the 1907 mutiny had illustrated the distance between the local populations and the military institution, it did not follow, as demonstrated above, that B\u00e9ziers or the rest of southern France had renounced patriotism. In fact, when the war came in August 1914, the recruitment centre of B\u00e9ziers registered only half the nationwide figures of draft dodgers (0.89 per cent against 1.5 per cent).[CITATION-59] Yet, the negative image and reputation of southern soldiers persisted strongly throughout the war; it also helps to explain the virulence of the so-called \u201815th Army Corp polemic\u2019. In the autumn of 1914, after a series of defeats, southern regiments fighting with the 15th and 16th Army Corps were accused by some politicians and national newspapers of having fallen back under the enemy\u2019s fire. These critics blamed the \u2018indolence\u2019 of the southern troops for this retreat. This polemic reactivated traditional stereotypes and the opposition between the South and the North that could be found in publications and private correspondence alike.[CITATION-60] The urban appropriation of the war experience had been made even more difficult in B\u00e9ziers by the relocation of the 17th Infantry Regiment after the 1907 mutiny; the town had had a long-established relationship with that unit. This makes all the more remarkable the efforts made by the local elites and by the town council in particular to strengthen the links with the 96th Infantry Regiment, which had replaced the 17th. These efforts culminated on 26 October 1917 when the Municipal Council officially proclaimed that the 96th had obtained its \u2018droit de cit\u00e9\u2019, a revealing turn of phrase denoting both acceptance and citizenship. In its resolution, the Council expressed the pride of the \u2018little fatherland of B\u00e9ziers ()\u2019 in its \u2018adoptive regiment\u2019.[CITATION-61] The grateful reply of the commander of the town\u2019s garrison was unsurprising and certainly good politics. Most interesting, however, was the response of the field commander of the regiment. Echoing the \u201815th Army Corps polemic\u2019, he wrote to the Mayor on 7 November 1917 to thank the Council and to reassure the town that \u2018the sons of the, and of B\u00e9ziers in particular, [would] never allow anyone to question their valour in combat\u2019.[CITATION-62] Although the regional make-up of the regiment was by 1917 more diverse than such discourses assumed, the commanding officer nonetheless felt it important and necessary for his letter to deploy the tropes of urban and regional identity.[CITATION-63] At the war front itself, of course, the life of southern soldiers differed little\u2014if at all\u2014from that of their fellow countrymen or counterparts across the line. Yet the French historiography of the Great War has for the best part of four decades ascribed them a prominent role in the discussion of front-line experience. This is, in no small part, due to the impact of the memoirs of Louis Barthas, a barrel maker and socialist activist from the Aude, whose remarkable testimony was published in 1978 on the initiative of the historian R\u00e9my Cazals.[CITATION-64] The first in a long and still growing series of diaries and memoirs written by \u2018ordinary\u2019 soldiers, Barthas\u2019s recollections captured the imagination of a large readership. In vivid and often cynical prose, Barthas tells a war story that resonated with many veterans and their descendants. Recalling the misery and horrors of industrial warfare, Barthas recounted trench life from the point of view of the common soldiers and NCOs. Castigating French commanders for their murderous incompetence, Barthas denounced the war as well as the empty rhetoric of nationalism. A fascinating and gripping text, his memoirs rejected any notion of patriotic mobilisation and exemplify a Socialist and pacifist vision of the war. Born in a village some forty kilometres west of B\u00e9ziers, Barthas served in the 296th Infantry Regiment, the reserve of the town\u2019s 96th. It is therefore useful to place his testimony alongside that of other local soldiers, such as that of Georges Crassous.A wine-grower from theof B\u00e9ziers, Crassous had, like Barthas, benefited from little formal education beyond primary school. An anti-clerical and Socialist activist, Crassous had been involved in a series of wine-growers\u2019 strikes in the years leading up to his military service in 1913. Crassous first saw combat on the Western Front in the 61st Infantry Regiment, part of the much-maligned 15th Army Corps. After fighting at Verdun and the Somme, he was transferred to the Arm\u00e9e d\u2019Orient in January 1917 and contributed to military operations in Greece and Serbia. He returned to France in July 1918 and served there until his demobilisation in the summer of 1919.Crassous\u2019s unpublished diaries never shy away from the horrors of war and recount, at times in graphic detail, his encounter with industrial warfare. As critical of his commanders as most other, he resented any infringement of the equality among combatants. In September 1917, he wrote to the Socialistof B\u00e9ziers to protest the implementation of furlough policies, underlining the paradoxical persistence, in a war for \u2018Right and Justice\u2019, of inequalities in the treatment of soldiers.[CITATION-65] In his first wartime letter, written to his parents on 1 August 1914\u2014\u2018a fateful time, an anxious time, a criminal moment\u2019\u2014Crassous harboured no illusion about a war which would bring about \u2018the most awful atrocities, the cruellest sufferings\u2019. Yet he went on to express his hope that it might \u2018bring about eternal Peace and the welfare of humankind\u2019. Crassous here echoed the majority of French Socialists who had resigned themselves to war, in the hope that the defeat of German militarism would consolidate and spread social democracy across Europe.[CITATION-66] In another letter sent on 9 March 1915, he castigated \u2018those damned Boches, whose might and atrocities cannot hide\u2019 their precarious military position. Keen to reassure his parents, he exhorted them to \u2018trust in the future, so we will have the joy to see each other again in perfect health\u2019.[CITATION-67] Yet his letters and diaries also reveal a more personal and indeed mundane vision of the war: \u2018A thousand farewells with hope of return, for I leave happy to be defending your persons, your property\u2019, he wrote.[CITATION-68] Notwithstanding his ideological understanding of the war, Crassous clearly construed it as a defensive conflict. At stake was not just the future of the Republic and of progressive politics, but the safety of his own family and home. Indeed, Crassous saw the war primarily through the conventional lenses of class, occupation and local identity. Fighting in Champagne in the fall of 1915, the wine-grower took the time to remark on the grape harvest in the region and defied the military curfew to pick a few of those grapes.[CITATION-69] In Greece and then in Serbia, he reported on the state of vineyards as he fought, in foreign lands, to safeguard the.[CITATION-70] Interestingly, and despite his gruelling experience of war on the Western Front, Crassous resented even more his time in south-eastern Europe and longed to \u2018live again under the beautiful sun of the\u2019.[CITATION-71] As the arrival of a new major appeared to raise his morale, he expressed his \u2018desire\u2019 to \u2018spend the grape-harvest at home\u2019, for the first time in four long years.[CITATION-72] On 29 August 1919, the last entry in his war diary succinctly noted his return home, where many, including his parents, had started another harvest.Understated and construed through class and local identities, Crassous\u2019s undeniable patriotism largely eschewed the language of nationalism. His diaries and letters illustrate a point made by Pierre Sorlin on the basis of a sophisticated discourse analysis. Despite the talent of its publicists and its capacity to whip up political controversies, the French nationalist movement largely failed to impose its language and concepts in early twentieth-century France.[CITATION-73] Patriotic mobilisation drew its strength from nationhood, a sense of belonging and loyalty to the national community, which cannot be confused with nationalism. The unpublished diary written by another soldier from the area, a left-wing agricultural labourer named Emile Jourdan, also raises questions usually neglected by those content to confine the discussion to an alternative nationalism/anti-patriotism. Jourdan\u2019s family history was intimately bound up with the political and social struggles of the region. His brother was among the mutineers of the 17th Infantry Regiment in 1907 and had been sent to Tunisia as a punishment.[CITATION-74] As was the case for Crassous and indeed for the majority of combatants, Jourdan equated his war experience with misery and suffering. In contrast to Crassous\u2019s diaries, Jourdan never explicitly used patriotic vocabulary in his. And yet, in one of the darkest periods of his service, in February 1916 he complained, as any good anti-clerical republican would, of the \u2018propaganda\u2019 of chaplains. \u2018Poor Republic\u2019, he wrote on 13 February 1916:if you don\u2019t realise this soon enough, this clique will try to destroy you since many of your defenders will have disappeared, unlike those shirkers, nurses or stretcher-bearers at the rear or inthat the Dalbiez Law will never reach.[CITATION-75] In drawing such a stark opposition between shirking non-combatants or clerics and the defenders of the Republic, Jourdan articulated a rather common Republican vision of patriotic duty, shorn of the rhetoric of nationalism, but imbued with commitment to a defensive war. Jourdan\u2019s rejection of propaganda, of nationalist(literally \u2018brain-stuffing\u2019), was common enough. Yet it did not entail (as was indeed only rarely the case across the French armed forces) a rejection of national solidarity.[CITATION-76] To the historian of the First World War, the absence of conventional markers of nationalism or patriotism in many combatant and civilian testimonies begs the question of the very existence of patriotism in wartime. Historians and literary scholars have long established how the \u2018high diction\u2019 of nationalism collapsed when confronted with the realities of industrial warfare.[CITATION-77] By contrast, the testimonies of anti-militarist and internationalist soldiers such as Louis Barthas have atttained a prominence in both collective memory and the historiography which has made their perspective paradigmatic. Yet they remain just as problematic as the writings of militant nationalists. After all, Barthas\u2019s remarkable testimony was rewritten over a lengthy period after his demobilisation. As the introduction to the original 1978 edition indicates, Barthas sat down every night to rewrite and consign his wartime recollections to notebooks supplemented with postcards and pictures. While his editor, R\u00e9my Cazals, invites us to accept his family\u2019s claim that Barthas never amended his original testimony, both the linguistic quality and political consistency of the work clearly undermine this contention. Although this does not diminish the undeniable value of his testimony, it nonetheless underlines the political nature of Barthas\u2019s undertaking. Though his diaries may not have been intended for publication, their rewriting in the relative privacy of his home was as much a performance as the rhetorical flag-waving of any nationalist writer.The local and indeed individual appropriation of the national military experience was therefore an important aspect of the dynamic of cultural mobilisation in wartime France. Yet, in evoking the geography of patriotic mobilisation, we should not play down the national purchase of the rhetoric of the \u2018blood tax\u2019 that was inseparable from the revolutionary notion of \u2018lev\u00e9e en masse\u2019.[CITATION-78] The cultures of war in 1914\u201318 were indeed grounded in the moral superiority that each belligerent alliance claimed to embody. The ethics of mobilisation also ran deeper and helped define and regulate behaviours and social relations within the belligerent societies. Here again, the cultural dynamic of mobilisation stemmed from the transformations of warfare, for the totalising logic of the conflict also led to the emergence of specific sets of norms associated with wartime social life. In this context, the mobilisation of the urban home front prompted the emergence of new divisions and new categories within the citizenry of belligerent societies whose respective positions were evoked in terms of duty and defined by the wartime \u2018social relations of sacrifice\u2019.[CITATION-79] Accordingly, the front-line soldier stood out as the main character and role model in a wartime narrative which defined ideal civilian comportment in terms of duty, sacrifice and solidarity. The demands of industrial warfare were such that the material comforts of the home front populations were expected to become a casualty of the war. Material deprivations indeed soon added to military losses to foster a growing sense of victimisation on the home front. The dialectical articulation of victimisation and participation thus structured the perception and behaviour patterns which ultimately determined the levels and forms of social mobilisation. There are few better ways to approach the tensions inherent in patriotic mobilisation than to consider how southern communities responded to the influx of refugees from the north and eastern regions of the country.[CITATION-80] The experience of those who had fled the combat zones to seek refuge in B\u00e9ziers sheds light on the moral underpinnings of wartime patriotism.Up to the beginning of 1915, refugees symbolised a wider war culture and their fate represented the barbarism of German warfare.[CITATION-81] They were at this time considered as heroic victims of German militarism and were treated as such; supporting refugees was therefore elevated to a prime patriotic duty by national authorities and civil society alike.[CITATION-82] Yet, from 1915 onwards, tensions surfaced and incidents broke out between Belgian refugees and their hosts across the country. \u2018Boches du Nord\u2019, \u2018Dirty Belgians\u2019, \u2018German\u2019 and other terms of abuse were hurled at the exiles who unsurprisingly resented them and urged their representatives to demand that they be treated more respectfully.[CITATION-83] Likewise, refugees from Alsace-Lorraine and the northern regions of France suffered defamation from their southern fellow citizens, who mistook them for German-speakers and hurled at them the infamous abuse: \u2018Boche\u2019. Evidence garnered from postal censorship bore out the recurrence of such incidents, asserting that the \u2018gap between the North and the South () seemed to grow wider\u2019.[CITATION-84] Reinforced by deep and reciprocal ignorance as well as linguistic or legal marks of otherness, the refugees were no longer granted much sympathy or any special status among war victims. When every family was now facing grief and mourning, refugees found themselves accused of enjoying safety, of idleness, and of grim opportunism. Local populations no longer ascribed to them any dignifying quality. As far from the front as the people of B\u00e9ziers and the south might have been, they, too, saw themselves as victims of the war. Increasingly insensitive to the particular plight of refugees, they demanded from them total participation in the war effort.[CITATION-85] The dynamic of social mobilisation for war reflected the social fabric of the belligerent society. In this case, regional differentiation reinforced specific tensions created by the war.More generally, as the war dragged on, a series of distinct \u2018characters\u2019, dominated by the towering figure of the soldier-in-arms, came to embody the ethics of mobilisation, creating, as John Horne puts it, a \u2018language of social morality (what is felt to be \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cunjust\u201d, acceptable or unacceptable)\u2019 which regulated \u2018relations between social actors\u2019.[CITATION-86] The munitions worker, the nurse, the shirker, to name but a few, thus presented distinctive figures of mobilisation, however positive or negative, that corresponded to specific levels of participation in the war effort. Across belligerent societies, one figure, that of \u2018profiteer\u2019, became the paradigmatic embodiment of this language.[CITATION-87] Suspicions were first likely to be attached to those who had been spared from military duty. Even in countries where conscription was in place, age, disability or medical condition were not always enough to avoid bitter recriminations, particularly as women\u2019s contribution to the wartime economy and society challenged conventional gendered definitions of patriotic service. Beside military service, the issue of fair access to foodstuffs and other material resources lay at the core of accusations of profiteering. In B\u00e9ziers, as in most towns and cities of the societies involved in the war, denunciations of real or supposed crimes against the wartime moral economy were a contentious and not uncommon means to enforce these social norms. For instance, Victor Bonnemalle, a local shopkeeper in B\u00e9ziers, was accused of trafficking gold in August 1915. Despite the lack of substantiating evidence, the police felt compelled to investigate a citizen whose respectability, according to the Police Commissioner, was proved by his regular contributions to patriotic charities. Meanwhile, rumours swirled around town and reputations were tainted if not irremediably damaged.[CITATION-88] Similar dynamics were at work across all belligerent societies where profiteering and shirking were often held up as the negative definition of one\u2019s own patriotism. France is indeed no exception here. Wartime patriotism was the product of the nation\u2019s cultural geography, of pre-existing political cultures, and of the specific ethics of wartime mobilisation that cut across local and national communities.The political history of France during the First World War has long focused on high politics, civil-military relations, and on the growth of the state apparatus.[CITATION-89] For their part, labour historians have often concentrated on strikes, while the socialist movement has also been scrutinised by political and intellectual historians.[CITATION-90] Although the cultural history of the war has often largely drawn inspiration from the study of national or local public opinion, it has rarely attended to popular politics as such. Urban history, however, allows us to bridge this gap and to illuminate the nature and significance of local politics in wartime. It is indeed at this level that the quotidian operations of the state and its direct interactions with citizens appear clearly, activities which are often obscured in those national sources that document the workings of the Republican state apparatus.The conduct of urban politics in 1914\u201318 is quite an elusive subject, since the disruptions brought about by the war substantially modified the urban polity. The suspension of the electoral process as well as the curtailment of the public sphere by censorship, propaganda and material hardships were obvious examples of wartime changes. Likewise, the conscription of political activists had strong implications for local political life. In this context, the study of urban civil society underlines the critical functions that social conflicts performed in the process of patriotic mobilisation. Contrary to traditional interpretations, the wartime growth of the state\u2019s apparatus and intervention did not strip local civil societies of their mediating role. Indeed, a closer look at urban associations reveals the extent to which the war altered the social location of power and therefore shifted political conflicts into the realm of voluntary organisations. The organisations of urban civil society were contentious spaces that partially filled the gap left by the wartime curtailment of the public sphere. In this context social conflicts refracted the new kinds of political problems entailed by the war and were as a result critical to the success or failure of patriotic mobilisation. The social relations of sacrifice took on political dimensions because the issues of recruiting and conscription, of the organisation of labour, of the supply and shortages of food or coal challenged and often undermined the legitimacy of authority on national and local levels alike.A series of strikes highlighted these political challenges in B\u00e9ziers in 1917\u201318, when carters, hairdressers, carpenters, seamstresses and metalworkers employed in a munitions factory all downed tools.[CITATION-91] Unsurprisingly, the latter were under constant monitoring, but the police apparatus never recorded, even during the most heated meetings, any condemnation of the war as a national, defensive imperative.[CITATION-92] The impact of inflation on the cost of living as well as the organisation of recruitment were, however, denounced as critical infringements of the idea of equality of sacrifice which underpinned social mobilisation and the patriotic compact.[CITATION-93] On the other side of the battlefront, the urban history of Germany has similarly underlined the importance of such conflicts over access to and distribution of essential resources.[CITATION-94] Part and parcel of the process of mobilisation, these conflicts enabled belligerent societies, by way of strikes and protest, to articulate the conditions of their commitment to the war effort. A continuing process of negotiation and bargaining thus manufactured popular consent to a war effort elaborated as much through struggles and conflicts as through outspoken support.[CITATION-95] The study of urban mobilisation thus enriches our understanding of wartime politics. It also invites us to look afresh at the impact of the wartime mobilisation on conventional conceptions of citizenship and of the state. French Republican political philosophy, however, was built upon individual\u2014as opposed to communitarian\u2014autonomy and on the primacy of the nation-state. In other words, this form of universalist and abstract Republicanism left little conceptual room (if any at all) for intermediary bodies and communities to play a mediating role between the individual citizen and the nation-state. As a result the \u2018articulation of political universalism and the diversity of opinions and identities\u2019, or, as C\u00e9cile Laborde put it, \u2018how to represent the social in the Republic\u2019 raises particular challenges for historians.[CITATION-96] Specifically, this framework of analysis, derived from the Third Republic\u2019s language of politics, hampers historical investigations into the local dimensions of citizenship.The functions of social regulation performed by urban elites in wartime enable the historian to investigate the political dimensions of social mobilisation that lay beyond party politics. Social conflicts revealed the tensions provoked by the wartime economic disruptions but also provide insights into significant changes in the structure and sociology of political participation. When seamstresses went on strike in B\u00e9ziers in 1915 and 1917, they asked the town\u2019s mayor to forward their demands to their main customer, the military.[CITATION-97] The fact that such a political mediation was performed by municipal elites is hardly surprising. It first reveals the extent to which the French structure of authority, based on the concept of popular sovereignty, had been internalised since the formation of the Third Republic. It also confirms that mayors, elected to represent both the urban community and the state, were peripheral but none the less essential linchpins of the Republic.[CITATION-98] Moreover, this seamstresses\u2019 strike is all the more revealing in that their gender excluded them from formal participation in the electoral process and from the mainstream of political life. Although limited in scale and confined within the town\u2019s boundaries, this social movement challenged their gendered exclusion and forced local elites to recognise their claims and to engage with them as political actors.As Charles Tilly demonstrated, the evolution of warfare and its growing demands for material resources and organisational reforms accounted for the formation and development of state structures in Europe. While \u2018the organization of coercion and preparation for war\u2019 constituted the state\u2019s main objectives and functions, the raising of mass armies and the advent of industrial warfare contributed to the extension and gradual empowerment of the citizenry.[CITATION-99] Thus, Tilly set out to explain \u2018how war made states and vice versa\u2019. He also suggested how the preparation for war and war-making affected the polity as a whole, including urban civil society within which the respective demands of the state and the citizenry were mediated. The First World War dramatically reinforced the terms of the social contract to which \u2018citizenship\u2019 refers; it also underlined the central place of negotiation, bargaining and conflict in the organisation of solidarity and in the operations of the state\u2019s coercive apparatus.The history of the wartime state has largely and rightly focused on national administrative structures and governmental agencies.[CITATION-100] The urban history of mobilisation supplements this perspective with an investigation into the adaptation of public services in the exceptional circumstances of the conflict. Civil society provided many of the material and human resources needed so badly by the state. From strict control to flexible partnership, circumstances dictated the attitude of the state towards civil society organisations. Circumstances, if not universal goodwill, imposed co-operation\u2014even in France, where the prefects, the local representatives of the national government, were traditionally reluctant to cede or share any of their prerogatives with civil society. Due to the limitations of administrative bodies disorganised by military mobilisation, assistance to soldiers\u2019 dependents and war victims was ensured by civil society organisations active in each locality.[CITATION-101] In 1916, the French government strengthened the framework in which voluntary organisations had been operating, passing a law on 30 May 1916 to regulate the activities of \u2018charities calling upon public generosity\u2019.[CITATION-102] Most interestingly perhaps, the necessities of war and the structure of military recruitment forced a temporary redefinition of the contours of the local state.The indisputable expansion of state agency entailed by the nature of an industrial conflict waged on a global scale is well known.[CITATION-103] Yet, local, national and comparative studies have demonstrated how voluntary organisations compensated for the shortcomings of the state, proving indispensable in the mobilisation of the material and cultural resources of the nation, and even benefiting from the war.[CITATION-104] Historians of the state have stressed the necessity and importance of the \u2018state\u2019s ability to secure the consent of key groups in civil society\u2019.[CITATION-105] The degree to which the French state co-operated with\u2014and indeed relied on\u2014civil society during the war underlined the \u2018pragmatic pluralism\u2019 of the Third Republic in 1914\u201318. Born out of necessity, such pragmatism was also born out of opportunity. In this regard, too, the structure of military participation had a significant political impact. While the number of enlisted men as a percentage of the male population of military age hovered around 80 per cent in France (as opposed to 53 per cent in Britain), the number of potential political activists among the younger cohorts was significantly curtailed in the former.[CITATION-106] In B\u00e9ziers, where the figure was 84 per cent, military recruitment exceeded the national average. It further reinforced the social determinants of a political system that already put a premium on the accumulation of social capital and financial resources. This point stresses the importance for historians of political life of paying closer attention to the sociological determinants of collective action. The first wartime initiative of the B\u00e9ziers branch of the Socialist Party was, as previously mentioned, to produce and publicise a letter stating its commitment to national defence. This was also its last official contribution to the local war effort. Military mobilisation soon deprived the branch of its leadership and of most of its male membership, and eventually forced it into abeyance.The Great War did not usher in any major upheaval, any redefinition of the organising and managing principles of the Republican state. Civil society was literally embodied by groups and individuals who were perfectly integrated into the Third Republic political system. There is no need for a detailed prosopography of urban elites to note the pre-eminence of teachers, lawyers and other professionals among the leadership of war-related charities. The Committee for the Relief of Wounded Soldiers of B\u00e9ziers does nonetheless offer a salient example of the dynamic at work here. Formed on the initiative of the Deputy Prefect to meet a need that the state could not, this private association was led by individuals who had been selected by the town\u2019s military authorities. They included prominent wine-growers (Cadenat, Viennet) and medical professionals (Dr Roger), while a local barrister, Ricateau, was the chairman. The over-representation of traditional republican elites was simply reinforced by the structures of military recruitment. The Parrains de l\u2019arrondissement de B\u00e9ziers, the organisation dedicated to local prisoners of war previously mentioned, originated in working-class and socialist milieus, which accounted for the social diversity of its leadership. By 1917, its takeover by middle-class professionals reflected in no small part the impact of conscription. Socialist organisations simply no longer had enough members to keep it running.The unitary republican state could therefore give pluralism its chance since military mobilisation had,, transformed urban political sociology and all but eliminated oppositional groups and activists. The social and political proximity between these urban elites and the upper echelons of the state administration accounts for the latitude granted to voluntary organisations by the prefectoral administration. The war challenged institutional and normative definitions of the Republican state and vindicated the pragmatic approach to public service embraced by the contemporary legal theorist L\u00e9on Duguit.[CITATION-107] For Duguit argued that the modern state was, in the era of the Great War, better understood not as a set of coercive institutions, but as a provider of public services:The modern State increasingly appears as a group of individuals working in a concerted fashion to meet the material and moral needs of participants, under the leadership and control of governing authorities; the notion of public service is thus substituted for that of public might; the State ceases to be an authority that orders to become a group that works.[CITATION-108] For the best part of thirty years, the historiography of the French experience of the Great War has focused on the cultural dynamics of wartime mobilisation. Scholars continue to argue over the existence and importance of a specific \u2018war culture\u2019 that not only turned national sentiment into a powerful mobilising device, but also accounted for French resilience in the face of industrial warfare. Paradoxically, however, patriotism has remained a marginal concern. The historiographical debate over \u2018war culture\u2019 remains oddly detached from wider scholarly discussions over nationhood and nationalism. It also suffers from a common and detrimental conflation of patriotism and nationalism, even in the \u2018banal\u2019 forms that Michael Billig deconstructed so effectively. Nationalism invokes an ideological coherence as well as the systematic primacy of the nation. It fails to offer an account of the characteristics of patriotism. Billig\u2019s critical work also ignores the potential of patriotism to sustain social mobilisation against the state.[CITATION-109] Indeed, as this article has argued, the mobilisation of urban and peripheral identities did not necessarily set them in a collision course with national mobilisation, even when protesters took on state authorities. In fact, the experience of B\u00e9ziers and southern France suggest that the resilience of the national polity proceeded from the capacity of the French political system to accommodate such assertions of local identity. The relationship between the national centre and the urban and regional peripheries was one of collaboration and integration as well as one of resistance and open conflicts. For patriotism was, and should be, understood in both an anthropological and legal-political sense, as a performance of solidarity to kith and kin; as a performance of loyalty to an imagined community of fellow citizens. The First World War witnessed patriotism in action and the French experience of the conflict underlines the plurality of communities and territorial identities which made up the nation.[CITATION-110] Nationalism\u2014both as a political project and as category of analysis\u2014is intimately bound up with the demands that the state may place on the citizenry. By contrast, patriotism underlines the capacity to mobilise nationhood to assert distance from the state and even to resist its authority when its demands no longer seem legitimate. In reaffirming the necessary distinction between patriotism and nationalism, this article has sought to avoid the implicit depoliticisation of nationhood that the evocation of \u2018national sentiment\u2019 has encouraged in the cultural history of the First World War. To an extent, the argument echoes the distinction that John Breuilly has drawn between the \u2018motivational nationalism\u2019 of nationalist movements and the \u2018structural nationalism\u2019 mobilised in times of crisis.[CITATION-111] This article has also sought to strengthen and sharpen this distinction in order to highlight the articulation and integration of distinct but coeval territorial identities. In this regard, urban history offers an excellent way to demonstrate the inherent pluralism of patriotic mobilisation, in that it allows the historian to scrutinise the mobilisation of regional identities in the service of national defence.[CITATION-112] The perspective adopted here emphatically rejects the essentialist definitions of identities propounded by regionalist or nationalist movements. It rests on a pragmatic and pluralist approach to urban, regional and national identities. As a result, identities are here defined as cognitive as well as political resources, which enabled social groups to define themselves in relation to other constituent groups within the national community and to make sense of the experience of war.[CITATION-113] They were mobilised in a contingent manner to carry out particular social or political agendas. The success of wartime national mobilisation did not rest on an improbable national consensus, but on the capacity of patriots of all hues to reconcile their diverging understandings of the national project to defend the existence of the nation-state. In this context, social movements performed a critical role, allowing social groups to assert the condition of their participation to the war effort. As the urban history of the First World War enjoys a revival, the approach adopted in our study of southern France demonstrates that the belligerent communities both relied on and transformed the multi-layered social fabric that tied individuals and groups to the imagined national community. In France, the process of mobilisation hinged on urban and infra-national solidarities that did not undermine the war effort but ultimately reinforced the resilience of the belligerent nation at large. Pluralism was indeed key to the success of French national mobilisation during the First World War.The victory of the Allied coalition in 1918 vindicated patriotic mobilisation and safeguarded the French Republic and its national sovereignty. Yet the economic and social dislocations of the inter-war period soon reopened the debate over the legitimacy of the Republic. Competing and sometimes incompatible definitions of the nation itself often lay at the roots of the polarisation that defined French politics between the wars.[CITATION-114] In his contemporary analysis of the fall of France in 1940, Marc Bloch offered searing insights into the failure of political mobilisation for that later war. Significantly, the co-founder of the, a demobilised soldier and anti-Nazi resister, explicitly linked national cohesion and patriotic mobilisation to a continuing commitment to political pluralism.It is good, it is healthy that in a free country, contradictory social philosophies freely contend with each other. It is inevitable, in the current state of our societies, that different classes defend conflicting interests and acknowledge their antagonisms. The misfortune of the fatherland begins when these clashes are no longer deemed legitimate.[CITATION-115] A veteran of the First World War, the great medievalist might have here been drawing on his own experience of the travails and eventual success of French patriotic mobilisation between 1914 and 1918."

    "text": "Shortly after William of Orange arrived in Devon at the outset of the Glorious Revolution in 1688, Dutch troops stationed in Dartmouth seized the, a ship laden with marble purchased for the French court at Versailles. This seizure precipitated an extraordinary insurance dispute in Paris between two little-known royal companies: the Royal Insurance Company and the Royal Marble Company. This article analyses the fractious dispute and the companies at its heart. In so doing, it reflects on the dispute as a product of the French state\u2019s broader exploitation of companies as tools of risk management: the state leveraged private capital in order to spread the risks of its virulently anti-Dutch commercial policy. Yet the dispute also exposed the ambiguities of war and peace in seventeenth-century thought and practice. In justifying their refusal to pay out on the insurance policy they had signed on the, the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s directors suggested that an insurer could decide unilaterally that France was in a state of war, thereby triggering a contractual clause that would shift the onus back onto the policyholder. Although Louis XIV himself stepped in to defuse the dispute at its most contentious moment, the state proved unable to respond to the challenge posed to its sovereignty, with significant consequences for the French insurance industry and maritime commerce up to the end of the Old Regime.On 27 August 1688, at 16 rue Quincampoix in central Paris, a very ordinary transaction took place. Here in its offices, the Royal Insurance Company () signed a marine insurance policy with the Royal Marble Company (). Through this policy, the Royal Insurance Company agreed to reimburse the Royal Marble Company up to 16,000 livres tournois if the, or the Carrara marble with which it was loaded, was damaged or lost in the course of its voyage from Genoa to Le Havre in northern France.[CITATION-1] When thewas seized in England at the outset of the so-called Glorious Revolution, this ordinary transaction became the subject of a most extraordinary conflict. This article analyses the conflict, piecing together evidence from the extant registers of the Royal Insurance Company, the records of Paris\u2019s admiralty court and other archival sources in England and France.[CITATION-2] In analysing the tentative resolution to this messy conflict, the article makes a key contribution to the study of early modern insurance. While the field has witnessed a recent renaissance, France has not yet reaped the benefits.[CITATION-3] The article thus offers the first close study of the Royal Insurance Company in over seventy-five years, and for the first time sketches the conflict resolution system for insurance disputes in Paris after the promulgation of theof 1681.[CITATION-4] In so doing, the article draws on, and offers empirical support for, recent analytical works on mercantile conflict resolution and management in pre-modern Europe.[CITATION-5] This is especially valuable in the light of the paucity of sources at the historian\u2019s disposal for studying the multi-institutional nature of early modern insurance conflicts.Nevertheless, while the article revolves around an insurance conflict, its central focus is on what this conflict reveals about royal companies in France and their function in serving state interests. The nature of the state\u2019s intervention into the dispute sheds light on the limited life cycle of the companies, which were conceived of and treated as tools of risk management for the state in spaces where it was weak, thereby existing and functioning \u2018in the absence rather than the dominance of the state\u2019.[CITATION-6] Here, I quote Philip Stern, who used this phrase in reference to the English East India Company, whose privileges were justified by the fact that they operated in distant lands where the state itself could not maintain a presence. Yet interests in distant lands depended upon control and mastery of the \u2018wild, unruly, and untameable\u2019 sea, which became a focal point for debates on state sovereignty throughout the early modern period.[CITATION-7] By bringing the maritime sphere back into the analysis of European chartered companies, as C\u00e1tia Antunes and Kate Ekama have recently suggested, we can appreciate how corporate and non-corporate actors interacted and came into conflict in spaces closer to home.[CITATION-8] In the case under discussion here, I go further still: the state\u2019s precarious hold over maritime affairs led the Royal Insurance Company to claim that France was in a state of war before the formal declaration of war was made against the Dutch in late November 1688. This threatened to undermine state sovereignty in metropolitan France itself and contributed to a broader destabilisation of the conceptual divide between war and peace in pre-modern political thought and legal practice.Seen in this context, the conflict was the product of the state\u2019s ability to manage risks through establishing business relations with close allies. Nevertheless, it emerged from, and drew unwanted attention to, both state weaknesses in the maritime sphere and the space within French commerce for a plurality of understandings of war and peace. The ambiguous resolution to the dispute had implications that fomented further conflict across France up to the end of the Old Regime.By the seventeenth century, marine insurance had already become firmly entrenched in commercial centres across Europe. The oldest known policy was issued in Genoa on 20 February 1343, transferring risks at sea to the underwriter in exchange for an agreed sum (i.e. the premium).[CITATION-9] From the Italian states, insurance migrated across the Mediterranean and later northwards.[CITATION-10] By the time the policy on thewas signed, Amsterdam was firmly established as Europe\u2019s leading insurance market. London was already a major centre too: together with the Royal Exchange, Edward Lloyd\u2019s coffeehouse was just emerging as a significant space for the negotiation of insurance policies and the dissemination of maritime information.[CITATION-11] The rise of insurance across Europe had not been without controversy. Early scholastic thought, focusing on the aleatory nature of insurance, had placed insurance in the same semantic field as gambling, enshrining a broader moral suspicion of insurance and other similar business instruments, such as bills of exchange.[CITATION-12] Francesca Trivellato has recently documented the rise of an antisemitic legend in seventeenth-century France concerning the origins of insurance and the bill of exchange. In the case of insurance, this was a prejudiced manifestation of French society\u2019s anxieties about the scope for underwriters to renege on their commitments\u2014and the potential for this to bring about the policyholder\u2019s financial ruin.[CITATION-13] In turn, policyholders could exploit information asymmetries to the detriment of underwriters: they could, for example, conceal information about the seaworthiness of a vessel to secure more favourable terms. Taking such asymmetries to their extreme, policyholders could even over-insure a vessel with multiple unwitting underwriters and then deliberately sink it, walking away with a handsome profit.[CITATION-14] Moral hazard\u2014that is, the capacity for parties to enter an insurance policy in bad faith\u2014thus underpinned the instrument\u2019s capacity to engender chaos in commercial life.[CITATION-15] As a tool for managing risk, insurance was itself risky.The two companies in thedispute operated within this environment of suspicion towards insurance. Although surprisingly little has been written about it, the Royal Insurance Company was entirely typical of the privileged corporate model exploited by the French state in the 1680s.[CITATION-16] It was the pet project of Jean-Baptiste Antoine Colbert, marquis de Seignelay, who succeeded his famous father as secretary of state for maritime affairs () in 1683.[CITATION-17] Following in his father\u2019s footsteps\u2014Colbert had created an ill-fated insurance chamber in Paris in 1668\u2014Seignelay established the Royal Insurance Company in 1686 with the intention of challenging the dominance of Amsterdam\u2019s and London\u2019s markets, at the same time as reducing the outflow of specie from France in premiums in a period where coinage was in short supply.[CITATION-18] He also hoped the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s conduct would serve as a model for underwriters across France, thereby addressing prevailing fears of moral hazard in the insurance industry.[CITATION-19] Seignelay had restructured the French East India Company () and created the Guinea Company () in 1685 to encourage small groups of wealthyto invest in the state\u2019s commercial projects. A\u2018was any person who handled the king\u2019s money\u2019, but many were close allies of the Crown who were essential in supporting the public debt, especially in times of war, through their services as tax farmers.[CITATION-20] Following the model of these companies, Seignelay encouraged thirty, royal allies and notable merchants to invest a total of 300,000 livres in the Royal Insurance Company. Five of these shareholders were selected to serve as directors at any one time, being replaced in a fixed pattern every six months. These directors handled the company\u2019s activities, agreeing and signing insurance policies on behalf of all the shareholders, who shared any profits or losses with the directors equally.[CITATION-21] Among the shareholders was Jean-Baptiste de Lagny, who had been appointed by Seignelay as director general of commerce () in 1686. Lagny had extensive ties to royal finance, and served as a general farmer for the state from 1680 onwards.[CITATION-22] Profit was not the central motivation for those who joined. As part of the institution\u2019s letters patent, Seignelay presented shareholders with a suite of privileges: most significantly, they were given priority in filling vacancies in the directorship of the French East India Company, and a company shareholder was chosen every two years to serve as a judge on Paris\u2019s prestigious merchant court.[CITATION-23] The social, commercial and legal privileges of membership meant, to quote David Bien, that \u2018the return was a different kind, one measured not in money but in the psychic satisfaction found in enhanced social standing\u2019 and access to networks of royal patronage.[CITATION-24] In the same vein, the Royal Marble Company was established as part of the French state\u2019s broader strategy of challenging Dutch supremacy in the provisioning of marble to northern Europe.[CITATION-25] It was also the product of factionalism at Versailles: when Fran\u00e7ois-Michel Le Tellier, marquis de Louvois, succeeded Colbert as secretary of state for the royal household () in 1683, the provisioning of marble to the French court was in the hands of Pierre Formont, a valued ally of the late Secretary.[CITATION-26] Louvois moved immediately to remove Formont and the remaining favourites of Colbert in order to introduce his own system for meeting the court\u2019s marble needs.Louvois began by establishing a royal company, signing a contract in February 1684 with a group of Crown allies to provide marble to the court at favourable rates. In August 1686, he broke this contract to sign another with a new royal company that was based on rue Th\u00e9venot in Paris.[CITATION-27] The partners were Jean Haudicquer de Blancourt, who was involved in the general farm in the posts of Guyenne and Toulouse; Claude Accault, a royal counsellor () and also a tax farmer; Claude Delaistre, a royal counsellor and secretary; Simon de Montgrand, a royal counsellor; and Dominique de Montgrand, sieur de Mazade, a nobleman based in Marseille.[CITATION-28] While Montgrand de Mazade did not sign the original contract, he was soon granted power of attorney by the Royal Marble Company to co-ordinate its activities in Italy and was later acknowledged as a partner.[CITATION-29] Therefore, just like Seignelay, Louvois opted to give the contract to a group ofand Crown allies upon whom he could depend to fulfil state needs while also serving their own interests through currying royal favour.[CITATION-30] This company, like its predecessor, was tasked with providing Carrara marble to the court. As its name suggests, Carrara marble was sourced in and around the city of Carrara in north-western Italy. It was prized across the world for being of the highest quality, used even in the construction of the Taj Mahal.[CITATION-31] This made it ideal for crafting statues for the French court, where mediocre marble from the Pyrenees was inadequate in expressing the glory and magnificence of the Sun King.[CITATION-32] Nevertheless, the transport of marble from Carrara to France was a true logistical challenge, and the Royal Marble Company was supported in this undertaking by naval officials () and the consuls of the French nation in Genoa and Livorno.[CITATION-33] With their support, theset sail from Genoa loaded with thirty-seven blocks () of marble, purchased for 8,755 livres.[CITATION-34] If the voyage had gone to plan, thewould have arrived in Le Havre, at the mouth of the Seine, where the marble would have been loaded ontosmall vessels used to load and unload large ships\u2014to be carried upstream to Rouen, and then loaded again onto river boats to be carried towards Paris. Following the terms of the contract, payment for this marble would have come only after its safe arrival, with three quarters paid when the marble arrived in Le Havre and the remaining quarter upon arrival in Paris.[CITATION-35] But thenever reached Le Havre. In November 1688, the ship entered the English Channel, encountering high winds while also being chased by two Dutch frigates.[CITATION-36] In the face of these twin risks, the shipmaster, Jean Trullet, chose to dock in Dartmouth on 26 November NS.[CITATION-37] In so doing, thebecame the subject of an unfortunate confluence of extraordinary circumstances. Unbeknownst to Trullet, William of Orange and the Dutch fleet had landed just up the coast in Torbay on 15 November to seize the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland from James II.[CITATION-38] The so-called Glorious Revolution had begun. William and his army marched towards Exeter, arriving on 19 November. When thedocked in Dartmouth, William was still in Exeter.[CITATION-39] Meanwhile, on the very same day as thedocked in Dartmouth, Louis XIV declared war \u2018by sea and land against the Dutch\u2019, making Trullet and his ship an unwitting enemy of the invading Stadtholder.[CITATION-40] Upon disembarking on 27 November, Trullet \u2018was captured \u2026 by the soldiers of the Prince of Orange, who took him prisoner\u2019 in Dartmouth Castle. Several soldiers and an officer then took three lifeboats to board, seize and loot the ship, forcing the remainder of the crew to surrender in the process.[CITATION-41] Eventually, the ship was taken to Starcross (near Exeter) on or just before 16 August 1689. It was ultimately condemned, along with its cargo, on 27 September.[CITATION-42] Thewas lost.Back in Paris, the two companies were in conflict even before thehad reached Dartmouth. While the policy agreed a premium rate of 7 per cent, it also contained a war clause\u2014that is, if war broke out between France and any other country, the Royal Marble Company was liable to pay a 3 per cent augmentation of the premium, or else the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s coverage of the risk would cease. On 9 November, \u00c9tienne Jagault, the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s registrar, wrote to the partners of the Royal Marble Company to warn them that, since it had failed to pay the augmented premium, the Royal Insurance Company would no longer be liable for any losses resulting from the war. For reasons that become clear below, the company was still acknowledging liability for any other type of loss.This warning was given seventeen days before war was formally declared by Louis XIV. How did the Royal Insurance Company justify this? The directors argued that \u2018acts of hostility had [already] commenced\u2019 between France and the United Provinces, meaning that France was already at war, if not.[CITATION-43] This warning was prompted, perhaps, by insider knowledge from Lagny, who, as director general of commerce, had access to all flows of information in the Secretariat of State for Maritime Affairs in Paris. This access left him well placed to keep the directors abreast of all attacks on French ships\u2014and to inform them that a formal declaration of war against the Dutch would soon be made.[CITATION-44] On 15 November, the partners of the Royal Marble Company protested the demand for payment before the, the city\u2019s \u2018main royal trial court\u2019, arguing that they had no obligation to pay the augmented premium because \u2018there had not been a declaration of war\u2019.[CITATION-45] Jagault followed this up on 4 December, insisting that the Royal Insurance Company remained discharged of any war risks now that war had been declared. The Royal Marble Company finally acquiesced, paying the 480 livres demanded on the same day.[CITATION-46] By this point, thehad already been seized in Dartmouth. An account of the seizure was given before a judge of Le Havre\u2019s admiralty court by three members of the crew only on 24 December.[CITATION-47] It was presumably Montgrand, who was based in Le Havre, who sent word of the loss to his colleagues in Paris. Adrien Vanier, the cashier of the Royal Marble Company, abandoned theand its merchandise to the Royal Insurance Company on 14 January 1689.[CITATION-48] This transferred ownership of these effects to the insurers in exchange for payment on the insurance policy.Following theand the institution\u2019s own letters patent, the Royal Insurance Company was obligated to make payment on policies within three months of a declaration of abandonment, even if it disputed the claim for payment.[CITATION-49] 14 April came and went with no payment made. What followed was a great deal of paperwork and disagreement\u2014rather like insurance practice today\u2014with the Royal Marble Company pushing the Royal Insurance Company to make payment. On 27 April, the Royal Marble Company issued its first warning that, if payment was not made soon, they would use the \u2018ways of law\u2019 to pursue payment for both the principal and the interest now accruing on it.[CITATION-50] In theory, the procedure for resolving insurance conflicts was carved in stone through the(see). This, together with the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s letters patent, enshrined that all insurance disputes would be put to arbitration in the first instance, with each party selecting a practising merchant or banker as an arbiter.[CITATION-51] Their judgment would then be ratified by the admiralty court. This was the \u2018institutionalisation of arbitration\u2019 in action.[CITATION-52] The procedure for resolving insurance conflicts, as outlined in the 1681.In keeping with this procedure, Jagault wrote to the Royal Marble Company on 30 April, informing the partners that the Royal Insurance Company recognised no responsibility for the loss and would present their reasoning before arbiters. The company named Claude Villain as their arbiter and invited the partners of the Royal Marble Company to choose an arbiter in turn. Accepting this invitation, the partners announced their choice on 6 May: none other than Jacques Savary. Savary was perhaps the most famous merchant in Europe during the late seventeenth century, as the author of, \u2018the most reprinted, translated, and plagiarised merchant manual of early modern Europe\u2019.[CITATION-53] It was at this point that the conflict grew out of control. On 14 May, the Royal Insurance Company demanded that the Royal Marble Company name \u2018another arbiter thanSavary, who is not of the quality required\u2019 by the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s letters patent.[CITATION-54] Now 66 years old, Savary was, it seems, no longer a practising merchant, which disqualified him from serving as an arbiter in the case. The Royal Marble Company took poorly to this demand, and chose to escalate the dispute immediately, eschewing the procedure outlined by the. The very same day, the partners petitioned Paris\u2019s admiralty court to judge the dispute. It agreed to do so, with proceedings noted on 27 May and 6 June that produced no clear result. On 20 June, the Royal Insurance Company submitted its choice of Claude Villain as arbiter to the court and asked that, in express conformity with theand the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s letters patent, the Royal Marble Company be compelled to follow suit and settle the dispute through arbitration instead of through the court.[CITATION-55] Apparently, the court did not agree to this. Instead, it passed judgment on the case before it between 20 and 26 June.[CITATION-56] Not simply finding in favour of the Royal Marble Company, the court submitted the directors of the Royal Insurance Company tothat is, they were sentenced to be imprisoned until the debt was paid in full. This was the ultimate violation of the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s letters patent, which held that the directors would never be held personally liable for the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s debts. The company was an explicitly unlimited liability institution, meaning that all its shareholders were liable for any losses (in proportion to their investment) once its funds were depleted, but directors were expressly accorded no further responsibility for any debts in their capacity as directors.[CITATION-57] Ron Harris has recently argued that shareholder liability was not expressly delineated by corporations before the period 1780\u20131830 because the circumstances did not exist for this to be necessary.[CITATION-58] Yet shareholder liability was at the heart of the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s creation and its functioning: for Seignelay, a clear demarcation of shareholder liability was essential in ensuring the creditworthiness of the institution. Through such a demarcation, policyholders-as-creditors were assured indemnification even if the company itself became insolvent.[CITATION-59] This affront to the directors\u2019 rights was especially egregious, as, following the most literal interpretation of the phrase \u2018personally liable\u2019, it was not their effects that were being seized here, but their own bodies. However, like the protagonists of a Greek drama, the directors were saved from this judgment by. Just as Apollo arrives on stage to restore order at the conclusion of Euripedes\u2019, the Sun King himself issued letters of safe conduct on 26 June, protecting the directors for three months against the claims of the Royal Marble Company and expressly forbidding the execution of the admiralty court\u2019s orders.[CITATION-60] Unlike Apollo, however, Louis XIV could not bring this conflict to an emphatic and mutually agreeable resolution. He could only try to bring the parties to the table in a more auspicious setting. Almost certainly with Seignelay and Lagny pulling strings at Versailles to protect the directors, an order of the Council of State followed on 6 July that \u2018quash[ed] the sentences made in the seat of the admiralty of France in Paris\u2019 and ordered that the parties name arbiters \u2018who are merchants or bankers, conforming to theof 1681\u2019.[CITATION-61] The dispute would go on, but this time before peers who would perhaps be better placed to restore order.Accordingly, Claude Accault came to 16 rue Quincampoix on 18 July to sign thethe formal document submitting the dispute to arbiters and binding both parties \u2018to execute\u2019 their judgment as if it were the \u2018order of [a] sovereign court\u2019.[CITATION-62] Demonstrating that tensions were still running high, Jagault wrote at first that Savary was the Royal Marble Company\u2019s choice for arbiter\u2014presumably on Accault\u2019s prompting\u2014before this was noticed and crossed out, with Michel Hazon being named in Savary\u2019s place. Recognising that this was a contentious issue, Villain and Hazon exercised their right to appoint a third arbiter to help them to judge the case. They chose Pierre Chabert, the consul to the French nation in Amsterdam, who had been forced to return to Paris after the outbreak of war. The three arbiters convened the parties at Chabert\u2019s house on the afternoon of Thursday 6 October 1689 to hear the arguments and deliver their judgment.The record of this extraordinary dispute is kept in the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s arbitration register. This register does not spell out the arguments presented by each party; instead, it lists the documents that were submitted to the arbiters for consideration: in keeping a record of these, the arbiters made sure that nothing was lost, ensuring that paperwork could be returned to the parties for later legal actions. Fortunately, we can sketch out the outlines of some of the arguments that were made by piecing this evidence together. As part of their supporting evidence, the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s directors submitted to the arbiters \u2018articles 28, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42\u2019 of the sectionand \u2018articles 24 and 26\u2019 of the sectionof the.[CITATION-63] With these articles as their legal foundations, the directors argued that the Royal Insurance Company was not liable for the loss of theon two grounds.Firstly, the directors submitted that the Royal Marble Company \u2018paid the [augmented] premium in case of war only after it had known of the loss of their ship and cargo\u2019, absolving the Royal Insurance Company of all responsibility for payment.[CITATION-64] This was built on articles 38 to 41 of. Article 38 declared \u2018null\u2019 all insurance \u2018made after the loss or arrival of the insured effects, if the insured knew or could have known of the loss, or the insurer of the arrival, before the signing of the policy\u2019.[CITATION-65] The potential to hold this knowledge was determined through the presumptions of articles 39 and 40: \u2018the insured will be presumed to have known of the loss, and the insurer the arrival of the insured effects, if it is found that, from the place of loss or the approach of the vessel, the news had been able to be carried [i.e. transmitted] before the signing of the policy to the place where it was concluded, in counting one and a half [nautical] leagues per hour, without prejudice to other proofs\u2019.[CITATION-66] For our purposes, this meant that, if a policy was signed but the loss had already occurred, the policyholder was presumed to have known of the loss through applying the \u2018league-and-a-half per hour\u2019 rule. The policyholder\u2019s good faith was not accepted as a legal argument by the, as this could not be established with certainty.[CITATION-67] Why did the directors draw on these articles? Clearly, they were not arguing that the loss of the ship on 27 November 1688 had been known to the Royal Marble Company when the policy was signed on 27 August. They were not reading the articles literally. Instead, they were drawing a nuanced legal analogy between the signing of the policy and the payment of the augmented premium. The directors\u2019 argument was that war had been declared by Louis XIV on 26 November, the same day as thedocked in Dartmouth, but the Royal Marble Company only paid the augmented premium on 4 December. This was ample time, through the application of the \u2018league-and-a-half per hour\u2019 rule, for the news of thefate to have reached Montgrand in Le Havre, to be then transmitted to Paris.Sadly, the calculation they presented to the arbiters is not spelled out. Nevertheless, we can make our own estimate. Let us presume that thewas seized as late as the evening of 27 November. Dartmouth is 50 nautical leagues from Le Havre, and Le Havre is 65 nautical leagues from Paris by river, making a total of 115 nautical leagues.[CITATION-68] In applying the \u2018league-and-a-half per hour\u2019 rule, knowledge of the\u2019s loss would have been presumed to have reached Paris late on the evening of 30 November (see).A visualisation of the movement of information, as conceptualised in thedispute.Of course, this is only an estimate. Yet even if we allow a degree of leeway and suppose that the news of the\u2019s loss was predicted to have reached Paris as late as midday on 1 December, this was still three days before the augmented premium was paid. In applying the rule, the directors argued they were not liable for payment.Could the analogy between the policy and the war clause be sustained? The directors no doubt insisted that it must. The original policy, the directors suggested, did not include the risks of war unless the augmented premium was paid\u2014that is, to use a common characterisation in the early modern insurance industry, the insurance policy was analogous to a sales contract. With the war clause, the directors argued that the risks of war remained the Royal Marble Company\u2019s property until the augmented premium was paid: it was only then, they suggested, that ownership of war risks was transferred to the Royal Insurance Company.[CITATION-69] In drawing on these articles from the, the company was suggesting that the payment on the war clause was a new transaction\u2014essentially, a new policy entailing a new transfer of risk to the insurer. As a result, the \u2018league-and-a-half per hour\u2019 rule had to be applied.This argument was built on legitimate concerns. The directors no doubt emphasised that, if the arbiters rejected their reasoning, the marine insurance industry itself would suffer: when war clauses were used, policyholders would be disposed to wait for news of any loss before paying the augmented premium. Insurers would thus become victims of moral hazard, receiving augmented premiums only from policyholders with losses to claim. In an industry where profit margins were slim\u2014and losses were especially common when war broke out\u2014insurers would simply try to exclude war risks through policy clauses or withdraw from the market entirely.[CITATION-70] To adapt an observation made by Guido Rossi, the rules of the game needed to favour insurers here rather than policyholders, or else insurance risked becoming untenable in times of political uncertainty\u2014just when it was needed most.[CITATION-71] Supplementing this argument was the suggestion that the Royal Marble Company had shirked its responsibility to report the loss in a timely manner. Article 42 ofstipulated that, \u2018[w]hen the insured receives news of the loss of the insured vessel or merchandise\u2019, the policyholder must inform the insurer of this news \u2018forthwith\u2019.[CITATION-72] While the Royal Marble Company submitted that it was informed of the loss of thetowards the end of December 1688, the declaration of abandonment to the insurers in Paris took place only on 14 January 1689. This point was no doubt intended to undermine any suggestion of good faith from the Royal Marble Company rather than contribute substantially to the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s own cause.For their second argument, the directors submitted that \u2018the master of the ship was negligent of his duties in conducting the ship, which could have caused its capture\u2019.[CITATION-73] Article 28 of the sectionfrom theheld that insurers were not liable for \u2018losses and damages coming to vessels and merchandise by the fault of masters and mariners\u2019 if barratry of the shipmaster was not explicitly listed as an insured risk in the policy.[CITATION-74] Consequently, the Royal Insurance Company tried to establish the shipmaster\u2019s negligence. Here, the directors invoked articles 24 and 26 of the section. Article 24 forbade shipmasters \u2018to enter any foreign harbour without necessity; and in cases where they are pushed there by storm or chased by pirates, they will be obliged to leave there and set sail at the first possible opportunity\u2019.[CITATION-75] Since thehad been forced to dock because of a stormbecause it was being chased, the directors presumably focused on the second clause, obliging the shipmaster to set sail as soon as possible after a forced stop. Theproved unable to set sail again, as Trullet was captured the day after by Dutch soldiers and the ship seized soon after that.It is Trullet\u2019s capture that seems to have been the key element of the directors\u2019 argument. It was certain that thehad not been able to set sail again, but they suggested that this was Trullet\u2019s fault: he had left the ship to go ashore, even though article 26 offorbade shipmasters \u2018to abandon their ship during the voyage for any possible danger without the opinion [i.e. agreement] of the key officers and sailors; in this case, they will be obliged to save, alongside themselves, the money and anything [else] they can from the most precious merchandise\u2019 loaded on the ship.[CITATION-76] The directors suggested that, by going on shore alone, Trullet had abandoned his ship; the fact that thewas unable to set sail once the weather improved was his own doing, as his capture was the result of his own negligence in going ashore rather than sending another member of the crew. One can sense that the company was stretching here: blaming the shipmaster for a loss was a common legal strategy in maritime disputes because it made for an easy argument, even if it was not always convincing.[CITATION-77] Meanwhile, the Royal Marble Company was following a very different legal strategy. The partners submitted seven documents to justify their interest in theand to prove it had been lost. These ranged from key documents, such as bills for the purchase of theand the marble with which it was loaded, to more trivial pieces, such as the bill for consular duties in Genoa. The partners knew that providing paperwork was their primary responsibility in a case like this: once they could justify their interest in the insured effects and provide evidence of their loss, the onus was on the insurer to prove they were not liable to pay. This meant that the partners engaged in a \u2018reactive\u2019 rather than \u2018active\u2019 line of argument\u2014that is, they responded to the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s legal argument rather than trying to make one of their own. Consequently, we cannot infer their responses from the documents they submitted to the same extent as we have for the Royal Insurance Company. Nevertheless, we can reasonably speculate on the types of response the partners may have offered.In response to the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s argument about knowledge of the loss of the, the partners likely responded that, notwithstanding the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s choice to invoke the \u2018league-and-a-half per hour\u2019 rule, they were informed about the loss of theonly after having paid the augmented premium on 4 December: members of the crew testified before the admiralty court of Rouen only on 24 December. In addressing the substance of the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s argument, however, the partners most likely submitted that the company erred in suggesting that the \u2018league-and-a-half per hour\u2019 rule applied in this instance. The policy itself had been signed long before the ship had been lost, and articles 38 to 41 ofreferred to the policy, not to war clauses, which were not addressed at all in the.Going further than this, it could reasonably have been argued that payment of the augmented premium entailed no transfer of risk and hence no new transaction. Making this argument would have depended on a close reading of the original policy that sparked the dispute. Sadly, I have not found it. Indeed, I have only found one of the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s policies to date.[CITATION-78] This policy was signed with the French Mediterranean Company (, also known as the) on 5 November 1687 (see).[CITATION-79] Decades later, the Royal Insurance Company provided a model policy (dated 24 March 1709) for a revised edition of Mathieu de la Porte\u2019s famous and successful accounting manual,, with terms that were scarcely different from those of the 1687 policy.[CITATION-80] We can therefore be confident that the policy signed with the Royal Marble Company followed the same form.The insurance policy of the Mediterranean Company, 5 November 1689.

War risks were not directly tied in the clause to the augmented premium, meaning that the partners could legitimately have argued that there was no new transfer of risk: the \u2018league-and-a-half\u2019 rule thus did not apply. As far as the partners were concerned, they had lived up to their obligations per the policy they had signed.The partners were in more familiar territory when responding to the argument about Trullet\u2019s negligence. They shrewdly submitted two insurance policies of 12 November 1687 and 30 April 1688, in which the Royal Insurance Company had insured the\u2019s return voyages from Genoa to Le Havre for a total of 26,000 livres. In both cases, Trullet was named as the shipmaster.[CITATION-83] From this, they argued that the company itself had endorsed Trullet as a competent shipmaster through their own underwriting.[CITATION-84] In any case, it was easy to argue that Trullet had acted appropriately, docking in Dartmouth only out of necessity and in total ignorance of what had transpired in Devon only days earlier. Given that the last major land invasion of England from the Continent had taken place 622 years earlier, Trullet could scarcely have been expected to foresee William of Orange\u2019s landing. Moreover, he could not have been expected to know about Louis XIV\u2019s declaration of war against the Dutch, since this came on the same day as the\u2019s arrival into Dartmouth. Even if the weather had allowed theto leave Dartmouth on 27 November, Trullet\u2019s capture by Dutch soldiers the same day had prevented this from happening. Put simply, the argument about Trullet\u2019s negligence had no legs.After reflecting on the arguments of both parties, the arbiters delivered their judgment. The Royal Insurance Company was ordered to make payment of 16,000 livres (the full amount insured) as well as interest on this starting from 14 April 1689 and expenses of 24 livres.[CITATION-85] In return, the Royal Insurance Company was granted full rights to the vessel and merchandise abandoned to them. Sadly, the reasons for the arbiters\u2019 decision are not given: it can only be presumed that they deemed the activation of the war clause not to be analogous to a new policy and considered the argument for Trullet\u2019s negligence unconvincing.With the conclusion of the case, Accault asked Jagault to transcribe the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s record of the case in full so that it could be submitted to the admiralty court. Jagault duly obliged, and on 13 October\u2014a week after the case had concluded\u2014Accault, Delaistre, Montgrand and Montgrand de Mazade submitted the transcription to the court for the judgment to be ratified.[CITATION-86] But the Royal Insurance Company was not finished: while the court ratified the judgment on 17 October, on 15 October they had received the company\u2019s directors, who signalled their intention to appeal the decision through the company\u2019s privileged appeals process, in which royal councillors and Paris\u2019s leading municipal figures would serve as the judges rather than theof Paris (see).[CITATION-87] The Royal Insurance Company\u2019s procedure for resolving insurance conflicts, following its letters patent of 1686.In the end, this appeal never took place. On 24 November 1690\u2014over a year after the directors had signalled their intention to appeal\u2014Accault, Delaistre, Montgrand and Montgrand de Mazade submitted to the admiralty court that, \u2018as a consequence of the withdrawal of the appeal of an arbitration sentence made on 6 October 1689 byChabert, Hazon and Villain\u2019, and with the consent given by the directors of the Royal Insurance Company before notaries at theon 23 September 1690, the Royal Insurance Company had formally relinquished any claim to the amount it had provisionally paid the Royal Marble Company following the arbitration sentence.[CITATION-88] The arbitration sentence now stood.So, in the end, the Royal Marble Company prevailed. But was it the winner in this dispute? In many ways, the conflict was a triumph of the state in managing the risks of its maritime and commercial projects. The theoretical literature on the historical development of business, and on the rise of the great chartered companies, has rightly stressed the strengths and weaknesses of different institutional structures in the management of risk.[CITATION-89] Yet the case of theoffers an illuminating example of the French state\u2019s capacity to exploit companies\u2014and the private capital that underpinned them\u2014as tools of risk management.Developing trade with distant markets\u2014especially the East Indies\u2014was a central plank of French commercial policy, although it was recognised that private resources alone could not overcome the significant barriers to entry.[CITATION-90] French merchants under Louis XIV acknowledged the need for the state\u2019s support in establishing the commercial and diplomatic frameworks necessary for trade in these markets.[CITATION-91] Yet establishing such frameworks was a costly and risky endeavour indeed; through recourse to chartered companies, the state was able to mobilise extensive private capital\u2014especially that of\u2014to share these risks. It is on these terms that Philippe Haudr\u00e8re suggests that \u2018Colbert\u2019s East India Company was an economic failure but a relative political success\u2019.[CITATION-92] Indeed, Marie M\u00e9nard-Jacob has recently argued that Colbert\u2019s East India Company allowed for the creation of the frameworks necessary for more successful trade in the eighteenth century: the outlay was significant, and shareholders bore the brunt of the company\u2019s early struggles, but these investments bore fruit in the long run.[CITATION-93] Elisabeth Heijmans has found that, in exchange for their commitment, shareholders in French chartered companies were able to exploit corporate privileges to conduct their own trade in these markets without competition.[CITATION-94] Yet the French state also relied on companies in markets closer to home. Even familiar waters remained precarious, and the state benefited here from shifting the risks of its commercial policy to companies as well.[CITATION-95] Theis a case in point. It was far from unusual for the state to rely on private groups in the procurement of Carrara marble, of course. Yet while naval officials and the consuls to the French nation in Genoa and Livorno provided logistical support to the Royal Marble Company in Italy and southern France, Louvois ensured that the state would bear none of the risks at sea by agreeing to make payment on any marble only once it had arrived safely in Le Havre. The Royal Insurance Company agreed to bear some or all the risks of the\u2019s voyagejust one of many voyages the company insured in which the state had a vested interest\u2014which further redistributed the voyage\u2019s risks among close allies of the Crown.[CITATION-96] When thewas seized in Dartmouth, the companies were left to fight among themselves in picking up the pieces, while the state bore none of the losses.Marble was a crucial medium in crafting the \u2018image\u2019 of the Sun King\u2014explored famously by Peter Burke\u2014but the case of theexemplifies how its procurement could defy the very values of order andit was intended to promulgate: both companies emerged, operated and disputed with each other within an environment of political precarity, both at Versailles and beyond the bounds of France.[CITATION-97] Such precarity ensured that, once they had outlived their use in undermining Dutch supremacy in their given industry, these companies were discarded unceremoniously by the state, without concern for the costs to those with a stake in them. We can see this play out in the Crown\u2019s intervention in the dispute, where Seignelay successfully interceded on the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s behalf. No doubt on his encouragement, the king signed letters of safe conduct to spare the directors from imprisonment, while a later order of the Council of State was issued to protect the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s interests by ordering that the dispute be taken before arbiters. Conversely, Louvois saw no need to protect the Royal Marble Company\u2019s interests: Montgrand de Mazade noted that, \u2018[with] the war of 1688 taking place, the entrepreneurs [of the Royal Marble Company] discontinued the supply [of marble] by order ofde Louvois\u2019.[CITATION-98] \u2018Evidently\u2019, as Genevi\u00e8ve Bresc-Bautier puts it, \u2018the transport of extravagant marble was no longer a priority\u2019, especially since thewas not the only vessel sent from Genoa in 1688 by the Royal Marble Company to encounter problems returning to France.[CITATION-99] With the company no longer able to serve its function, and the royal workshops having an ample stockpile of marble to draw on during the war, it ceased to be useful to the state.[CITATION-100] By contrast, the Royal Insurance Company sat at the heart of Seignelay\u2019s commercial policy and, with the outbreak of the Nine Years War, the Secretary was just getting started in exploiting the institution in service of state interests. The Crown\u2019s support for the Royal Insurance Company in the dispute was hence a matter of crude political expediency; the Colbert clan\u2019s modest \u2018victory\u2019 over the Le Tellier clan here must be interpreted accordingly.Indeed, the tide would soon turn, with the Royal Insurance Company sharing the fate of its adversary at the turn of the century. The Nine Years War hit the institution hard, with 529 insurance claims submitted in the years 1689 to 1692 alone (see),[CITATION-101] followed by a flurry of arbitration and admiralty cases in 1694 and 1695.[CITATION-102] By then, Seignelay had died, and his successors as secretary of state for maritime affairs hailed from the Ph\u00e9lypeaux clan, who were no friends of the Colberts.[CITATION-103] While the English Parliament debated bankruptcy protection measures in 1693 to support the underwriters of Lloyd\u2019s coffeehouse in London, who had also suffered throughout the war, Louis Ph\u00e9lypeaux offered the company no such support.[CITATION-104] This forced it to withdraw from the market entirely in 1695, to the detriment of the merchants of Nantes in particular, who had been securing coverage in Paris on a regular basis.[CITATION-105] With the end of war in 1697, Lagny proposed in 1698 to give the institution a new lease of life by recapitalising it, but Ph\u00e9lypeaux proved indifferent to this proposal. This was not because he felt the French insurance industry was in good health even without the company: indeed, he recognised that \u2018we are [still] insuring much of our commerce in Holland\u2019.[CITATION-106] Seignelay had intended for the company to undermine the markets of Amsterdam and London, but factionalism had ensured the failure of this ambition.The Royal Insurance Company\u2019s underwriting in the years 1686\u201395 in livres tournois, alongside the number of insurance claims in the years 1686\u201392. Source: Wade,, pp. 173, 302.The company\u2019s fate was sealed with Lagny\u2019s death in 1700: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Ph\u00e9lypeaux instigated a smear campaign against the institution in 1701. Just as political expediency spared the directors of the company from prison in 1688, so it ensured the company\u2019s demise in 1701; by 1710, the Royal Insurance Company existed in name alone.[CITATION-107] The consequences of this smear campaign were deeply felt in Paris and beyond: while London supplanted Amsterdam as Europe\u2019s leading insurance market after the Bubble Act of 1720, Paris was left behind, emerging again as an insurance centre only in the 1750s.[CITATION-108] The, and the dispute that followed its capture, thus speaks to a broader system of risk management that the French state deployed in service to its commercial policy. The state under Louis XIV had a long track record of reneging on its commitments to investors in its chartered companies, which were frequently dissolved or restructured at the Crown\u2019s behest in response to political oscillations.[CITATION-109] Thus, as Jeff Horn has argued, privilege was a powerful tool of economic development, but one that could be decidedly volatile.[CITATION-110] Nevertheless, the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s shareholders knew what they signed up for, and exploited whatever social, economic and legal privileges were on offer. Consequently, investment in any of the chartered companies was rather like underwriting itself: it was an exercise in assessing risk and predicting whether the benefits of shareholding (financial or not) would outweigh the inevitable costs. Conceptualising the French chartered companies in this way helps us to understand why they were very different creatures from their English and Dutch counterparts.[CITATION-111] The affair of thetherefore reaffirms that royal companies under Louis XIV in their various guises were truly institutions to be \u2018plundered from above and from below\u2019.[CITATION-112] The fractious and complicated dispute that emerged, where both companies were forced to dedicate much time and expense to resolving it in and out of court, was an unfortunate and inconvenient product of a system that was specifically designed to transfer the risks of the state\u2019s commercial enterprises to.Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to presume that this dispute was the by-product of a capricious, omnipotent state. Shifting the risks of the marble voyages onto the two royal companies had simply created unforeseen challenges that exposed the vulnerability of the French state in the maritime sphere. While theoutlined a clear procedure for resolving insurance conflicts, we can see inthat the path of this conflict was far from linear. Theobligated parties to insurance disputes to go before arbiters in the first instance, but the Royal Marble Company ignored this by taking their grievances directly before the admiralty court, precisely because they felt that this would force the Royal Insurance Company to come to the table and put an end to the dispute. It required the king himself to intervene to overturn the admiralty court\u2019s order to imprison the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s directors and to ensure that the procedure of thewas carried out.The path of theconflict.In the end, the admiralty court\u2014whose original judgment on the conflict was spurned by the king\u2014played a key role in resolving the dispute. The court ratified the arbiters\u2019 ruling and mediated the payment it had ordered, before finally witnessing the end of the dispute with the decision of the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s directors to drop their appeal of the arbitration judgment. To adapt Justyna Wubs-Mrozewicz\u2019s insights, arbitration and recourse to the admiralty court had become \u2018in [this] conflict, not stages of it\u2019.[CITATION-113] The process set by thehad been broken by the parties to the conflict, but the elements of it were put back together in a new configuration and a resolution was ultimately found. That this was possible reflected the agency of the companies in spite of their royal patronage.Such agency underpinned the crucial issue at the heart of the dispute. Thewas unable to offer the sort of clear guidance that would have kept the companies out of the courtroom and Chabert\u2019s house in the first place. This was an intricate legal affair, where an unfortunate confluence of events exposed not only an ambiguous contractual clause, but also the ambiguity of war itself. Villain, Hazon and Chabert could not look to thefor guidance here, as war clauses were not discussed in it at all. Their judgment gave no solution to the pressing question in the dispute: when was France to be considered in a state of war, and with what consequences for parties to insurance policies?Answering this question was not an easy endeavour. Late medieval thought had started to shift away from earlier conceptualisations of just war, allowing Alberico Gentili and others to articulate conditions for perfect (i.e. legal) war. In spite of this shift in conceptualisation, the Thomist concept of authority was essential to both awar and awar: \u2018[f]or a war to be legal\u2019 or just, as Randall Lesaffer has put it, \u2018it needed to be waged among sovereigns and to be formally declared\u2019.[CITATION-114] Gentili defined an imperfect war quite ambiguously as a series of isolated acts of hostility without, in his words, \u2018an interruption of friendly relations\u2019 between two sovereign powers.[CITATION-115] Whether imperfect war was really war at all was left unclear.Hugo Grotius transformed the discussion entirely by incorporating just war and perfect war within the same framework: here, natural law (interested in whether war was) coexisted with the volitional law of nations (interested in whether war was).[CITATION-116] In laying out this framework, Grotius followed Gentili in positing that a declaration of war and legitimate authority were necessary conditions of perfect war. Indeed, for Grotius, the two went hand in hand: a declaration of war made it clear that the war was being carried out only as a last resort by a legitimate sovereign power, in accordance with the volitional law of nations.[CITATION-117] Yet Grotius deviated from Gentili and others by defining an imperfect war in strict formal terms: for Grotius, an imperfect war was one precisely where one or both conditions of perfect war were not met. He was thus emphatic that \u2018imperfect war was still war\u2019: it was only in the nineteenth century that imperfect war began to be reconceptualised as \u2018measures short of war\u2019, more in line with Gentili\u2019s thinking, and thus beyond the definition of war altogether.[CITATION-118] Complicating matters further, Renaud Morieux has recently argued\u2014building on a rich literature\u2014that theoretical conceptualisations of war and peace often diverged greatly from supple and plural legal realities across space and time.[CITATION-119] Thedispute supports these findings. While Gentili, Grotius and others were focused on the issue of whether war was just or unjust, perfect or imperfect, the dispute rested on a clause in an insurance policy which left the way open to such distinctions being exploited. When precisely was a war clause activated in an insurance policy? Where theoffered no solutions, the Royal Insurance Company tried twice to offer its own. Firstly, the directors demanded payment of the augmented premium on 9 November 1688, seventeen days before war was formally declared by Louis XIV, on the grounds that \u2018acts of hostility had [already] commenced\u2019 between France and the United Provinces. Even though war had not been declared, the directors argued that a Grotian state of imperfect war had already existed at sea several weeks before 26 November. By presenting this solution, the directors argued implicitly that they could issue a formal statement, unilaterally absolving themselves of responsibility for war risks until the Royal Marble Company paid the augmented premium.In demanding the augmented premium so early, the Royal Insurance Company was exploiting growing ambiguities in how war was defined in theory and in practice in the seventeenth century. The directors were suggesting that, for the purposes of commercial activity and the functioning of the insurance industry, war was not the product of the formal exercise of power by the state. Drawing on the insider knowledge it received through Lagny in the Secretariat of State for Maritime Affairs, the company assumed the authority to decide that France was in an undeclared state of war with the United Provinces.Plainly, this was an explosive solution which, leaving aside the significant implications for state sovereignty, risked being abused by insurers at the expense of policyholders. Although the Royal Marble Company disputed the demand for payment before the outbreak of war, other policyholders may have acquiesced in\u2014and thereby endorsed\u2014such demands. The Royal Insurance Company\u2019s strategy thus might have succeeded in implicitly challenging state sovereignty.Nevertheless, the directors changed tack once the dispute reached arbitration, offering a far more reasonable and practicable solution. Here, they acknowledged that a formal declaration of war by the state\u2014meeting conditions for both a Gentilian and a Grotian perfect war\u2014was necessary for the war clause to be activated, but the payment on this clause had to be treated as a new transaction, thereby allowing the \u2018league-and-a-half per hour\u2019 rule to be applied. This needed to be applied, they argued, or else moral hazard would triumph in periods of war. Nevertheless, it was always going to be easy for the partners of the Royal Marble Company to argue that thegave no such guidance on war clauses and that no new transaction had occurred. Whatever ultimately informed the arbiters\u2019 decision, it was not thealone: this was a \u2018hard case\u2019, where there had to be \u2018an explicit interpretative dimension to the legal decision-making process\u2019.[CITATION-120] The dispute thus marked a triumph of the French state\u2014but it was a triumph in kicking the can down the road. Rather than take seriously the profound consequences of the dispute in defining war, and the solutions the Royal Insurance Company had proposed to resolve it, the state chose to focus on the legal process itself, thereby abdicating responsibility to arbiters who were in no position to address the underlying shortcomings of the.Although it could not have been known at the time, this abdication of responsibility had significant consequences for the French insurance industry in the long run. As the corporate model flourished in the eighteenth century, and the industry grew in the French ports, the ambiguities of war loomed ever larger. More and more wars were fought without a preliminary declaration, with evident implications for the insurance industry. Ultimately, the state was forced to acknowledge these ambiguities and offer a solution when litigation proliferated.[CITATION-121] The result was most inelegant: through a schedule of augmentation, all policies\u2014even those without war clauses\u2014were alteredso that all policyholders had to pay a set augmented premium depending on the insured route and the arrival or departure date of the insured vessel. Each port drew up their own schedule, before forwarding them to the Council of Commerce, which made the final decision.[CITATION-122] This process simply fomented widespread political dispute: the schedule that was adopted in each war ultimately hinged on who was best placed to lobby the state. While the schedule for La Rochelle was eventually upheld across France after the outbreak of the Seven Years War, the balance of power had shifted by 1778 with the outbreak of the Anglo-French War. Then, Parisian companies were able to lobby the Crown to select 17 June 1778 as the opening date of hostilities\u2014as opposed to the date of 29 July submitted in the schedule drawn up in La Rochelle\u2014and to impose higher augmentations than the Rochelais had proposed.[CITATION-123] Thus, in the insurance world, war had become an amorphous entity: the French state could now assert a retroactive state of imperfect war, beginning at different times in different sea spaces, with far-reaching consequences for overseas commerce. Evidently, the state appreciated the profound consequences for its sovereignty if the ports had been allowed to make such judgments themselves.[CITATION-124] Nevertheless, while the state refused to delegate sovereignty as the Royal Insurance Company had originally suggested, it ended up serving corporate interests anyway, shifting the balance of power decisively towards the insurer at the expense of the insured, who found themselves bound to retroactive, extra-contractual charges.Seignelay had created the Royal Insurance Company for three key reasons: firstly, he hoped to undermine the insurance markets of Amsterdam and London; secondly, he wanted to address moral hazard problems across France by setting standards in insurance practice for the rest of the kingdom to follow; and thirdly, he sought to exploit the institution as a tool of risk management for the state. Yet insurance was itself risky in ways that Seignelay had not foreseen: the Royal Insurance Company discovered that the ambiguities of defining war gave ample scope for moral hazard on the part of policyholders. By proposing standards for defining war across time and space, the company threatened to undermine state sovereignty. In the face of this challenge, the Old Regime state never found a satisfactory solution: through the schedules of augmentation, the state had to identify and acknowledge imperfect war. This had significant consequences in wartime, when the French economy was at its most precarious and the Crown relied most heavily on underwriters to keep maritime commerce going. In the midst of these choppy waters, with threats on the horizon, the French ship of state did not sail smoothly."

    "text": "Recent historiography has placed particular emphasis on the social origins and influence of individuals who took opposing sides in debates on the abolition of the slave trade between 1787 and 1807. There is no doubt that family networks and connections influenced patterns of pro-slavery and abolitionist support. Despite this familial focus, comparatively little attention has been paid to the attitudes and interventions in the debate of King George III and his family. As early as 1808, Thomas Clarkson\u2019srecorded how Prince William Henry, duke of Clarence, and his younger cousin, Prince William Frederick, second duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, held diametrically opposed views on the issue. Evidence that has recently come to light in the Royal Archives makes it possible to assess whether the divide between George III\u2019s son and nephew points to a royal family riven by disagreement on the rights and wrongs of slavery. By broadening the canvas of study to include other royal dukes, this article contributes to a much fuller understanding of the family\u2019s reaction to one of the most pressing moral and economic questions of the day. Their views were not just a matter of their own personal opinions; their interventions in debate affected (and on balance, impeded) the progress of abolition and had direct repercussions on the lives of hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans.Among the holdings of the Royal Collection Trust is the \u2018Jamaica Service\u2019 of silver gilt, comprising six ice pails, two five-light candelabra, two oval tureens, a sauceboat and salts.[CITATION-1] This gift was presented to Prince William Henry, third son of King George III and Queen Charlotte, who was created duke of Clarence in 1789.[CITATION-2] The service, paid for by the Jamaica Assembly, was to thank him for his efforts in defending the slave trade and slavery; it bears hallmarks from 1803 and 1804, suggesting that it was given to him a few years before the abolition of the slave trade.[CITATION-3] The intention was clearly strategic, as the island\u2019s sugar planters wished to encourage the duke\u2019s continued advocacy of their cause in the ongoing debate on abolition. In contrast, the king\u2019s nephew, Prince William Frederick, second duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, championed the abolitionist cause.[CITATION-4] This was acknowledged by an honourable mention in Thomas Clarkson\u2019spublished in 1808.[CITATION-5] These two royal cousins, situated at opposite ends of the political scale on abolition, illustrate how polarised views characteristic of national debate can be traced in the country\u2019s most high profile and influential family.[CITATION-6] Clarkson\u2019spraised the Duke of Gloucester for \u2018having opposed the example of his royal relations on this subject in behalf of an helpless and oppressed people\u2019.[CITATION-7] The views of Clarence and Gloucester were on public record as a result of their speeches in the House of Lords, whereas the king and his other relatives did not usually speak so publicly or directly. Leading abolitionists were convinced, however, that other senior royals shared Clarence\u2019s pro-slavery views. Wilberforce recorded in his diary in 1807 that Clarence and his younger brother, Prince Augustus, duke of Sussex, had stated their opposition to the Abolition Bill, and were \u2018speaking, as it was understood, the sentiments of all the reigning family\u2019.[CITATION-8] At a time when growing abolitionist sentiment collided with a pro-slavery culture in Britain, members of the royal family were clearly engaged in a wider \u2018transatlantic conversation about slavery and abolition\u2019.[CITATION-9] They were not unique in having disagreements; in Liverpool, the abolitionist surgeon James Currie observed how \u2018the general discussion of the slavery of the negroes \u2026 has made great havock in the happiness of many families\u2019.[CITATION-10] This article assesses whether the divide between Clarence and Gloucester points to a royal family riven by disagreement on the rights and wrongs of slavery. Evidence which has recently come to light in the Georgian Papers at the Royal Archives makes it possible to look afresh at the views of George III, and to consider the extent to which he agreed with the arguments presented by his son, the Duke of Clarence.[CITATION-11] Broadening the canvas of study to include other royal dukes contributes to a much fuller understanding of the family\u2019s reaction to one of the most pressing moral and economic questions of the day. Their views were not just a matter of their own personal opinions; their interventions in debate affected (and on balance, impeded) the progress of abolition, and had direct repercussions on the lives of hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans.[CITATION-12] The first section of the article analyses the strategies used by Clarence to oppose ideas he considered destructive to the wealth, influence and security of the empire. As a high-profile apologist for the West India interest, he articulated pro-slavery ideas that found support among the political elite, as well as some sections of the middling and lower orders of society.[CITATION-13] The second section considers the Duke of Gloucester, who, by contrast, drew on radical new ideas of political economy to attack his cousin\u2019s defence of slavery and to demonstrate that national interests could be reconciled with humanitarian concerns.[CITATION-14] Through his support for the new Crown colony at Sierra Leone, he showed a willingness to foster \u2018an alternative concept of empire\u2019 based on new ways of thinking about the use of African labour.[CITATION-15] The question of where George III and some of his other sons stood within the wide spectrum of opinion separating Clarence and Gloucester is the focus of the third section of the article. The final section considers the implications of these findings on slavery and abolition to a wider understanding of the political influence and image of monarchy during the reign of George III.The Duke of Clarence\u2019s gift from the Jamaica Assembly was a token of appreciation for his defence of the island\u2019s economy, sharing much in common with presentation swords given to naval officers who fought in defence of British Caribbean possessions during the Napoleonic wars.[CITATION-16] Embellished with symbols representing the wealth and imperial strength of the West Indian colonies, including armorial bearings, naval trophies and cornucopias, the Jamaica Service made a clear statement of the riches flowing from the plantations, but casually ignored the brutality of the system in its decorative use of the heads of enslaved Africans. By the time the service was completed by Digby Scott and Benjamin Smith II, its symbolism represented an idealised and outdated image of British West Indian planters, as the growth of abolitionism from the late 1780s, according to Trevor Burnard, had transformed their public image from \u2018ornaments of empire\u2019 to \u2018pariahs\u2019.[CITATION-17] By defending planters and the British slave merchants who supplied them, the duke publicly associated himself, and by implication the royal family, with men castigated for their cruel, vulgar and uncivilised behaviour.[CITATION-18] He used his political voice in an attempt to restore their reputations as loyal Britons and valued subjects of the Crown, a status they prized highly.[CITATION-19] He appropriated and adapted the abolitionist phrase that Africans were our \u2018fellow creatures\u2019 and referred to planters as our \u2018fellow-subjects\u2019.[CITATION-20] As an effective spokesman for slaving interests, Clarence systematically used his position in the Lords to oppose measures for the regulation and abolition of the trade, bolstering the pro-slavery campaign through his powerful oratory and the authority and patronage he was able to deploy.[CITATION-21] His regular participation in parliamentary debate, and his ability to rally support and votes for the pro-slavery cause, contributed to the defeat, or delay, of various measures. As a result of his intervention, the views of British slave merchants and agents for Jamaica and other Caribbean islands were heard almost verbatim in the Lords, as he not only tabled their petitions but also restated their arguments in his speeches. In opposing two abolitionist-sponsored bills in 1799, the duke tabled nine petitions from Liverpool and London merchants and West India planters.[CITATION-22] Ranging over the wide gamut of anti-abolitionist, pro-slavery and pro-colonial arguments used by the West India interest, Clarence set out to prove that the abolitionist case was economically damaging, anti-British, politically dangerous and strategically foolhardy. His powerful rhetoric grew out of, but also reinforced, an existing pro-slavery culture. He perpetuated the view that enslaved Africans were merely cargo, and remained impervious to suggestions that they were men and brothers.[CITATION-23] Although he presented some first-hand testimony based on his visits to Jamaica, his main contribution was not in the formulation of any original arguments, but rather in his high-profile rehearsal of arguments already used in the Commons by his network of supporters, including Sir Banastre Tarleton, MP for Liverpool.[CITATION-24] The duke\u2019s view of Africans as valuable commodities of use to the British Empire may well have pre-dated his entry into the Royal Navy, but his periods of service in the Caribbean shaped his outlook on slavery and furnished him with information and contacts that later proved valuable in the Lords. At the age of 17, during the American War of Independence, he visited Jamaica. When HMSwas anchored at Port Royal in 1783, he had the opportunity to go ashore and make \u2018some little excursions\u2019. Although no specific reference was made to visiting slave plantations, he met various officials and naval officers in Dominica, Antigua and Jamaica who informed him about commercial affairs.[CITATION-25] Horatio Nelson noted that balls and other entertainments were organised for the prince. In February 1783, he reported that \u2018A vast deal of notice has been taken of him at Jamaica: he has been Addressed by the Council, and the House of Assembly were to address him the day after I sailed. He has hisat Spanish Town: they are all highly delighted with him\u2019.[CITATION-26] The lavish hospitality offered to naval personnel played a part in shaping the \u2018lasting Friendship\u2019 that the prince formed with some of the \u2018Gentlemen of Jamaica\u2019.[CITATION-27] The Assembly, aware of the political advantages of retaining the prince\u2019s patronage, resolved on 2 December 1788 to make him a present of a \u2018Diamond Star\u2019.[CITATION-28] The gift, partly in recognition of his service in the Royal Navy, helped to nurture the prince\u2019s long-term commitment to the political defence of the islands. A widespread pro-slavery culture at the highest levels in the Royal Navy was reflected in the way Stephen Fuller, agent for Jamaica, \u2018prevailed upon seven Admirals a Commodore & a Captain\u2019 to give evidence opposing abolition in April 1790.[CITATION-29] The views that the prince later expressed in the Lords were very similar to those of his fellow naval officer and friend, Nelson. In a letter to Simon Taylor, a wealthy Jamaica sugar planter, Nelson explained on 10 June 1805 how he had been \u2018taught to appreciate the value of our West India possessions; and neither in the field, nor in the senate, shall their just rights be infringed, whilst I have an arm to fight in their defence, or a tongue to launch my voice\u2019.[CITATION-30] Letters sent home by Prince William provided a useful source of information for his father, who had never visited the Caribbean, or any other location outside Britain.[CITATION-31] In letters written to the king on board HMSin January 1787, four months before the formation of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, Prince William drew attention to the economic value of slavery and slave-produced commodities. Describing enslaved men, women and children in Dominica as financial assets, he noted that the \u2018trade in slaves at this island is very great owing to our supplying the French with that valuable commodity\u2019.[CITATION-32] A comment he made in 1785 may have had some bearing on the king\u2019s later response to calls for abolition. Writing to his father from Ireland just weeks before his twentieth birthday, the prince observed that \u2018I think the inhabitants here are in a more miserable state than the negroes in the West Indies\u2019.[CITATION-33] This was an early example of an anti-abolitionist argument used to contest the need to improve slave conditions, and may well have reinforced the king\u2019s view that reform was unnecessary.[CITATION-34] Five months after the Jamaica Assembly resolved to present the duke with a diamond star, he agreed to give evidence before the House of Commons. Fuller considered that his testimony would \u2018add great weight to the Cause of the Island of Jamaica, and the rest of the Colonies, and would be most gratefully acknowledged\u2019.[CITATION-35] Three years later, Fuller considered that Clarence had \u2018distinguished himself in a singular manner\u2019 during his questioning of witnesses at the Bar of the House of Lords in 1793. The duke\u2019s use of \u2018his local knowledge\u2019 of the Caribbean was seen as effective in eliciting evidence that \u2018struck the whole House\u2019.[CITATION-36] His questioning of witnesses was shaped by his conviction that stopping, or limiting, imports of enslaved Africans would be devastating to Jamaica and other Caribbean possessions.[CITATION-37] The duke\u2019s visits to the Caribbean were used to political advantage in the Lords. He was sufficiently astute to know that first-hand knowledge of Africa and the Caribbean was highly prized in debates on the slave trade. Abolitionists were eager to produce former slave-ship mariners as witnesses, including Alexander Falconbridge and John Newton, to counter the claims of their pro-slavery opponents.[CITATION-38] As a result, Clarence took every opportunity to frame his contribution to debate as an expert witness with authentic \u2018ocular proof\u2019, while at the same time emphasising that abolitionists\u2019 lack of first-hand experience meant that their claims of inhumanity were \u2018ill-founded\u2019.[CITATION-39] What is clear from his earlier correspondence with his father, however, is that the young prince made no effort to speak to any enslaved individuals during his visits to Caribbean islands. His reports were superficial, based on distant observation, and influenced by his friendships with planters.[CITATION-40] Judging by Fuller\u2019s reports, Clarence was able to speak with confidence and conviction about affairs in Jamaica. On 5 May 1792, Fuller reported to the Committee of Correspondence of the Jamaica Assembly that the duke gave an excellent speech in which he \u2018spoke most favourably of the treatment of the Negroes in general\u2019.[CITATION-41] The duke was on less secure ground when he spoke about the organisation of the slave trade, or the conduct of the trade in West Africa. He was unable to draw on any first-hand knowledge, and repeated arguments already presented in the Commons, or contained in petitions and pamphlets. When he argued that the trade saved many Africans from being used for human sacrifice in states such as Dahomey in West Africa, he drew on Archibald Dalzel\u2019s.[CITATION-42] The duke accepted Dalzel\u2019s view that Africans who sold and sacrificed enslaved people were savage and barbaric, and that Africans transported to the Caribbean would be treated more humanely by their new masters there.[CITATION-43] While the duke\u2019s first-hand knowledge of the Caribbean may have proved useful to the king, there is some tentative evidence to indicate that the exchange of information was reciprocal. George III may have drawn his son\u2019s attention to a source that he could use to demonstrate the value of West India property that would be lost by abolition. In a speech given in opposition to the Slave Trade Limitation Bill in 1799, Clarence closely followed assumptions contained in Arthur Young\u2019sa source that his father had employed extensively in his own writings.[CITATION-44] The duke used this source to calculate that 450,000 \u2018Negroes\u2019 valued at \u00a350 each were worth \u00a322,500,000, but noting that the price of enslaved individuals had risen to \u00a380 a head, he revised his calculation to \u00a336,000,000. After taking account of how \u2018utensils, mules, and crop [] on the ground, double the value of the Negroes\u2019, he lambasted the utter folly of abolitionists who \u2018desire you to relinquish your colonial wealth, the sinews of our commercial existence, and sink into insignificance and contempt in the eyes of Europe and the world\u2019.[CITATION-45] Aware of the propaganda value of the speech, the duke and his allies capitalised upon their victory in the Lords by publishing it as a pamphlet. Funding was provided by West India planters and Liverpool slave merchants as a mark of gratitude for the \u2018eminent services\u2019 of the duke.[CITATION-46] Although it was clear by 1807 that he was fighting a losing battle, Clarence continued to represent these vested interests to the bitter end.[CITATION-47] Just two months before his father gave his royal assent to the Abolition Bill, he tabled five petitions, including \u2018three from Liverpool, one from the Agents for Jamaica, and one from the Merchants in general concerned with the West-India trade\u2019.[CITATION-48] The Duke of Gloucester, a late entrant to parliamentary debate on the slave trade, made his most important contribution to abolition through his role in its enforcement after 1807. His abolitionist sympathies may well have developed more than a decade earlier, however, during his studies at the University of Cambridge, a notable \u2018site of antislavery activism\u2019.[CITATION-49] After taking up his seat in the Lords following the death of his father in 1805, his maiden speech provided a boost for the abolitionist cause. During debate on the Foreign Slave Trade Bill on 16 May 1806, he set out his implacable opposition to the trade on humanitarian grounds, and his royal status went some way towards counterbalancing the anti-abolitionist influence of the king\u2019s sons, his older cousins.[CITATION-50] Emphasising the \u2018misery and desolation\u2019 caused by the trade, the duke declared his unequivocal support for abolition in the presence of his more senior cousins who were seated close to him on the peers\u2019 bench nearest to the throne, and in order of their precedence. The fact that the Duke of Sussex countered shortly after with the argument that enslaved people were \u2018well treated in general\u2019 emphasised how far Gloucester was out of step with his cousins.[CITATION-51] Nine months later, Gloucester\u2019s speech in support of the Abolition Bill on its second reading was given in the presence of four of the king\u2019s sons: York, Clarence, Kent and Cambridge.[CITATION-52] Speaking directly after Clarence, he began by stating his support for Lord Grenville and emphasised how the question before them reflected on the \u2018honour and integrity of their Lordships\u2019.[CITATION-53] Gloucester challenged Clarence on his military claims, disputing his assertion that the trade was vital to the Royal Navy, and hence to the defence of the colonies.[CITATION-54] While re-stating arguments Thomas Clarkson had developed almost two decades earlier, Gloucester injected a new element into debate based on his first-hand observations in Liverpool. Pointing out that he had been on board slave ships, he emphasised that they could be readily adapted for troop transportation. These inspections, presumably made at Liverpool docks during his period as Commander of the North-West District, were used to challenge the claims of Liverpool slave traders that their considerable investment in ships would be wasted.[CITATION-55] The duke, who met Thomas Earle and other leading slave merchants during his residence at St Domingo House in Everton, dismissed their oft-repeated claim that they would be ruined by abolition.[CITATION-56] His argument that many new avenues of trade could be opened in place of the slave trade signalled his support for the Sierra Leone Company, whose directors had been so roundly attacked by Clarence in 1799.[CITATION-57] Gloucester\u2019s presence in the Lords was regarded as vital to the progress of abolition by the prime minister, Lord Grenville, and their correspondence from 1806 ensured that he received intelligence about the timing of parliamentary debates and the content of bills. He assured Grenville in January 1807 that, \u2018nothing shall prevent the Duke of Gloucester being in his Place on Monday next, and constantly attending the Progress of the Bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade through the House of Lords\u2019.[CITATION-58] He derived considerable satisfaction from the passage of the Abolition Bill, and clearly enjoyed receiving news from Liverpool\u2019s leading abolitionist, William Roscoe, about reactions in the port. He delighted in hearing reports that Roscoe\u2019s friends had sent two black men around the town carrying boards stating, \u2018we thank God we are free!!\u2019[CITATION-59] Three years later, the duke was pleased to receive news that attempts to fit out ships in Liverpool to revive the slave trade clandestinely had been stopped.[CITATION-60] Speechmaking and checking legislative proposals were among the ways Gloucester supported the progress of abolition, but his main importance lay in his influence on policies to enforce abolition and secure international treaty agreements. He saw the passage of legislation in 1807 as only the first step in halting the trade, and considered it vital to watch \u2018with a jealous Eye the Execution of the Abolition Act\u2019.[CITATION-61] Policing the implementation of this legislation on the coast of West Africa was central to the aims of the African Institution, and Gloucester agreed to serve as President of this powerful lobbying group, formed less than a month after the Abolition Bill received the royal assent.[CITATION-62] Although royal patronage was undoubtedly a valuable commodity, the gratitude accorded to him in 1808 and 1809 for his support was not merely hyperbole.[CITATION-63] He was much more than a figurehead and not a \u2018Silly Billy\u2019, a nickname that appeared in newspaper reports from the early 1820s.[CITATION-64] Using the powerful networks formed around him in the African Institution, the duke influenced the development of post-abolition policies in Britain and West Africa. In addition to chairing annual meetings, he worked behind the scenes in shaping policies for the suppression of the slave trade at the Crown colony of Sierra Leone. Captain Edward Henry Columbine, appointed as Crown governor in 1809, noted that \u2018the Secretary of State, & His Majesty\u2019s government in general, were very liberally disposed to attend to the requests & suggestions\u2019 of the Institution\u2019s members \u2018in all such matters as relate to the welfare of Africa\u2019.[CITATION-65] The need for further decisive intervention to halt the slave trade was set out in a prescient letter which Roscoe sent to Gloucester for his consideration in 1810. In a thirty-four-page document, Roscoe, a subscriber to the African Institution, debated whether Britain had the right to use its military power to suppress the export of enslaved Africans in the ships of other nations.[CITATION-66] Citing Cicero and other authors, he urged the duke to consider that if one nation acted against the welfare of another, there was just cause for intervention to prevent abuses. He raised the question of whether Britain was able to \u2018defend the continent of Africa against the depredations of those who persist in continuing the trade for slaves?\u2019 As Roscoe, in common with most British abolitionists, had never visited Africa, he was extremely naive in assuming that the slave trade could be halted using a small number of ships. He asked: \u2018Could she [Britain] not by means of a very few ships of war stationed along the coasts of that country bring that disgraceful traffic to a speedy termination\u2019?[CITATION-67] Gloucester\u2019s active role in policy formation is reflected in his lively exchange of ideas with Roscoe. Although he accepted that intercepting ships could be regarded as \u2018Right & just\u2019, he thought that Roscoe\u2019s proposals went too far. He agreed that, during wartime, Britain had the right to capture any slave ship belonging to France and her dependent states. He expressed serious reservations about Roscoe\u2019s insistence that Britain had the right to capture all foreign vessels carrying enslaved Africans whether or not they were at war with the country concerned.[CITATION-68] Such a vigorous policy of interception, he argued, would undermine treaty negotiations, particularly those with France and would involve Britain in \u2018great & momentous difficulties\u2019.[CITATION-69] International treaty negotiations, in Gloucester\u2019s view, were critical to stemming the trade. He considered it incumbent upon government to use peace negotiations to put pressure on countries, including Portugal and Spain, which continued to \u2018traffick in Human Blood\u2019.[CITATION-70] He was disappointed that \u2018in the late Treaty with the Government of the Brazils\u2019, the subject of abolition had been overlooked.[CITATION-71] The Anglo-Portuguese treaty agreed on 19 February 1810 did make a commitment to the gradual abolition of the trade, restricting Portuguese slave-trading to Portuguese possessions in Africa, but fell far short of the duke\u2019s hopes for immediate abolition.[CITATION-72] At a public meeting chaired by Gloucester in June 1814, it was resolved to submit petitions to government protesting that peace negotiations with France would allow a revival of the slave trade.[CITATION-73] By the summer of 1814, the duke had submitted petitions containing about 100,000 signatures to the Lords and he informed Roscoe that he would lose no time in tabling a petition from Liverpool containing another 30,000 signatures. He was confident that pressure could also be exerted on France by the sovereigns of allied nations, and he regarded Tsar Alexander of Russia as a keen advocate of abolition. He reported to Roscoe that his meetings with the Tsar had been accompanied by the \u2018most gratifying assurances upon the subject\u2019.[CITATION-74] Harnessing free African labour, in place of enslaved labour, to exploit the natural riches of Africa was central to schemes promoted by the African Institution. The duke and other subscribers considered that intercepting slave ships and releasing enslaved Africans at Sierra Leone offered the dual benefit of disrupting the trade and securing a new supply of labour. In order to foster conditions in Africa favourable to agrarian reform, Gloucester presided over discussions on dispatching cotton seeds, cotton gins, silk worms and plants from the East and West Indies to Sierra Leone. In the same year, 1809, he arranged for three African boys from Sierra Leone to study at the Royal Military Asylum at Chelsea prior to being sent back to Sierra Leone as instructors. Six years later, the duke wrote a letter of introduction for Thomas Clarkson to meet Tsar Alexander and explain the scope for \u2018legitimate\u2019 trade using his collection of African specimens.[CITATION-75] Lobbying by Gloucester and other members of the African Institution may have contributed to a change in attitudes to the role that Africa could play in a post-abolition economy. In 1808, Lord Castlereagh informed the king that changes \u2018in the Commercial Intercourse of your Majesty\u2019s Subjects with the Coast of Africa\u2019 made it \u2018Expedient to Institute an Enquiry into the possibility of opening Trade in other articles with that Continent\u2019.[CITATION-76] The close associations between the African Institution and the new Crown colony of Sierra Leone meant that Gloucester\u2019s role quickly became mired in controversy. Evidence gathered by Thomas Perronet Thompson, the first Crown governor, showed that 167 enslaved Africans released from two American ships by HMSin March 1808 had been marched from the harbour to the seat of colonial government at Fort Thornton, put in a cattle pen and sold to existing settlers for twenty dollars each. Robert Thorpe, former chief justice to Sierra Leone, re-stated these accusations seven years later and sparked a vitriolic pamphlet warfare in which the duke\u2019s name was given a prominent place. In a letter addressed to Wilberforce, vice president of the African Institution, Thorpe alleged that slavery had been allowed to continue at Freetown under the guise of apprenticeship.[CITATION-77] Given Britain\u2019s new vaunted role as the global champion of abolition, his claims were explosive. Admittedly, most of Thorpe\u2019s allegations related to the earlier period of Company control which pre-dated the duke\u2019s involvement, but the most embarrassing claim was Thorpe\u2019s report that individuals released from slave ships (referred to as \u2018Captured Negroes\u2019 and subsequently \u2018Liberated Africans\u2019) had been sold in Freetown at a time when Gloucester was the organisation\u2019s leading representative.[CITATION-78] Zachary Macaulay, the former governor of Sierra Leone, considered Thorpe\u2019s accusations so damaging that he felt compelled to write a lengthy letter addressed to the duke defending his own reputation.[CITATION-79] The Institution formally refuted Thorpe\u2019s damaging allegations with a point-by-point rejection of his claims, and these responses and counter-responses continued into multiple editions.[CITATION-80] The duke was prepared to ride out such controversies based on his conviction that Macaulay was innocent of all charges, and that the Institution was engaged in \u2018great work\u2019 making \u2018atonement to Injured Humanity\u2019.[CITATION-81] As Clarence and Gloucester adopted such sharply opposing positions, where did George III and other members of his family stand on the slave trade question? No clear evidence has yet come to light to trace the views of Queen Charlotte and the princesses, other than a few examples of pamphlets and cartoons which say more about the assumptions of the writers and satirists than they do about the royal family. In 1792, for example, the anonymous author ofappealed to the assumed maternal instincts of the newly married duchess by asking her to imagine the suffering of thousands of infants separated from their parents.[CITATION-82] The central appeal of thefocused on persuading her to convince her \u2018Royal Consort\u2019, the Duke of York, to oppose the slave trade. It also claimed that her example as an \u2018amiable daughter-in-law\u2019 would persuade George III and Queen Charlotte to discourage a \u2018villainous trade, by rejecting the produce of it\u2019. The pamphlet concluded with flattery, telling the duchess that if she helped Africans in this way, songs would be composed in her honour as \u2018the guardian angel of Africa\u2019.[CITATION-83] As the couple separated several years later, her anticipated influence was entirely imaginary.[CITATION-84] This lack of direct of evidence for the views of women at court is not to suggest that they were unaware of, or uninterested in, this debate; as Madeleine Pelling and Karin Wulf have recently noted, the court of Queen Charlotte included \u2018accomplished, intellectually curious, and literary women\u2019.[CITATION-85] In 1793, the Duke of York entrusted Clarence with his proxy vote on the Slave Trade Limitation Bill, which is suggestive of shared sympathies with his younger brother.[CITATION-86] In his role as commander in chief of the army from 1798 to 1809, York, the king\u2019s second son, provided extensive practical support for slavery. He had command of the king\u2019s forces during a period when thousands of enslaved Africans were purchased for army service, and there is no suggestion that he tried to discourage or limit the practice of \u2018military slavery\u2019.[CITATION-87] As he informed the king of the \u2018acknowledged utility of the Black Corps\u2019 in saving British lives in the West Indies in 1801, he was clearly aware of the strategic advantages of purchasing enslaved Africans for the army, particularly after the heavy losses incurred in Saint-Domingue.[CITATION-88] None of the king\u2019s seven surviving sons, all of whom were entitled to vote in the House of Lords by virtue of peerages conferred on them, supported the Abolition Bill on its second reading in February 1807.[CITATION-89] The Prince of Wales absented himself for political reasons but, in common with the other royal dukes, he had made his opposition to abolitionist proposals abundantly clear in earlier debates.[CITATION-90] When Macaulay was called to give evidence in defence of the Slave Trade Limitation Bill in 1799, he recorded that their \u2018chief enemies\u2019 included Clarence \u2018and the other royal dukes\u2019.[CITATION-91] The Prince of Wales voted against the bill; his proxy, held by his younger brother, the Duke of Cumberland, was among thirty-two votes cast against the \u2018motion made by Lord Grenville for going into a Committee on the Slave Trade Limitation Bill\u2019 on 5 July 1799.[CITATION-92] The dukes of Kent and Cumberland also voted against the bill.[CITATION-93] Prince Augustus, duke of Sussex, contributed to debate on the Foreign Slave Trade Bill in 1806. Despite the suggestion by his biographers that he was an abolitionist, his political behaviour in the Lords at this stage indicates otherwise.[CITATION-94] His speech opposing the measure on 16 May 1806 drew on the same type of arguments used by his older brother, Clarence.[CITATION-95] In the same year, he attempted to secure appointment as the governor of Jamaica, a role he pursued tenaciously in his desire for esteem and the need to prove himself useful to his father.[CITATION-96] Between December 1806 and January 1807, Sussex explored the possibility that Lord Caledon, an alternative candidate for the post, could take the governorship of Jamaica while he himself filled the same position at the newly acquired Cape Colony.[CITATION-97] Eight years earlier, while studying at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, he had formed a plan \u2018to offer himself a candidate for Liverpool\u2019 and discussed how he would canvass for the election with two men from the town. His tutor, Edward Livingston, described this as \u2018a mad project\u2019 and reported his concerns to Lord Dundas. It is difficult to imagine that the prince could have contemplated taking up either the governorship of Jamaica or a parliamentary seat for Liverpool without being of a pro-slavery turn of mind.[CITATION-98] Reconstructing George III\u2019s views on the slave trade and slavery is complicated by areas of silence, as well as conflicting evidence, in the Royal Archives. While his views on other issues of contemporary debate, including his implacable opposition to Catholic emancipation, emerge clearly in official correspondence with his ministers, his attitudes to the slave trade and its abolition are not set out as directly.[CITATION-99] The slave trade does not emerge as a prominent issue in matters of business between 1787 and 1807. In a context of prolonged warfare with France, the king was preoccupied with international relations, military strategy, the threat of invasion, and internal social disorder. As some of the king\u2019s periods of illness coincided with key phases in abolitionist debate, the extent of his correspondence on relevant political affairs is limited.[CITATION-100] Added to this, national debate on the slave trade was in abeyance for a number of years from the late 1790s.[CITATION-101] In the absence of direct statements by George III, various contemporary observers made assumptions about his views. Gustavus Vassa (commonly known today by his birth name, Olaudah Equiano), who had secured his own freedom from slavery, assumed that the king supported slavery. In his petition to Queen Charlotte of 21 March 1788, Vassa urged her to use her influence with her \u2018royal consort\u2019 to improve the condition of enslaved Africans from \u2018brutes \u2026 to the rights and situation of men\u2019.[CITATION-102] In March 1792, Gillray put words into the king\u2019s mouth in his cartoon \u2018Anti-saccharrites,\u2014or\u2014John Bull and his family leaving off the use of sugar\u2019. The king is shown saying that the sugar-free drink is \u2018delicious\u2019, but the caption for Queen Charlotte reveals that the boycott was a convenient device to lampoon George III\u2019s reputation for frugality.[CITATION-103] Others assumed that the king was sympathetic to abolition. Robert Bowyer, a publisher and painter of miniatures, explained in 1810 that he was sending the king a copy of[CITATION-104] He expressed his hope that the king would accept this new publication, as it commemorated \u2018a measure which must have so much accorded with those feelings of humanity & kindness which have ever been so conspicuous in your Majesty\u2019s disposition\u2019.[CITATION-105] One source in which George III engages directly with the question of slavery is an undated essay he authored sometime between 1748 and 1805.[CITATION-106] This essay draws onby Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu, first published in 1748.[CITATION-107] The pages devoted to slavery closely follow the contents of Book XV, Chapters One to Five of Montesquieu\u2019s work: \u2018In what manner the Laws of civil Slavery are relative to the Nature of the Climate\u2019.[CITATION-108] The king\u2019s essay repeats Montesquieu\u2019s observations that the state of slavery \u2018is bad of its own nature\u2019 and opposed to civil law and the law of nature.[CITATION-109] In other places, the king paraphrases Montesquieu\u2019s ideas in an apparent attempt to understand and interpret his writings, but this repetition offers no clear insight into the king\u2019s own views on slavery. There is one section, however, where the king expanded upon Montesquieu\u2019s writings and added his own observations on the slave trade. In the section based on \u2018the Slavery of the Negroes\u2019, George III paraphrased Montesquieu\u2019s explanation of how some justified the slavery of Africans. Montesquieu implicitly disagreed with these arguments but explained that if he were \u2018to vindicate our right to make slaves of the Negroes, these should be my arguments\u2019.[CITATION-110] George III\u2019s essay adapted this section, as follows:But what shall we say to the European traffic of Black slaves, the very reasons arg\u2019d for it will be perhaps sufficient to make us hold this practice in execration; such are the impossibility of cultivating the American Colonys without them, or if that is not quite the case, the produce of these Colonys as Sugar, Indigo, Tobacco &c. would be too dear, besides the Africans are black, wooly [] headed with monstrous features, nor have they common sense as they prefer a piece of glass to gold; such are the arguments for an inhuman Custom wantonly practic\u2019d by the most enlightened Polite Nations in the World; there is no occasion to answer them, for they stand self condemn\u2019d.[CITATION-111] The king added new sentences at the beginning and end of the section, which are particularly noteworthy. His references to holding \u2018this practice in execration\u2019 and \u2018an inhuman Custom wantonly practic\u2019d\u2019 may suggest that he accepted, or at least recognised, that arguments offered in defence of slavery were not creditable and were \u2018self condemn\u2019d\u2019.[CITATION-112] Alternatively, the additions to the text may provide the king\u2019s interpretation of the implications of Montesquieu\u2019s arguments and may not necessarily represent his own views.George III also elaborated on Montesquieu\u2019s text by referring to Africans as \u2018wooly headed with monstrous features\u2019.[CITATION-113] This phrase, reflecting stereotypical views of Africans of the type used by pro-slavery advocates, was not original to the king. The use of similar terms in published accounts provides some tentative indications of the dating of the king\u2019s unpublished essay. The term \u2018woolly-headed\u2019 appears in a number of travel accounts in the 1770s, including John Hawkesworth\u2019s, published in 1773, and held by the Royal Collection Trust.[CITATION-114] Five years later, John Trusler\u2019srepeated the description in Hawkesworth\u2019s volume that the inhabitants were \u2018black, and woolly-headed, like Negroes\u2019.[CITATION-115] Earlier uses of the term, however, can be dated to the first half of the eighteenth century. In 1703, Baron de Lahontan\u2019sdescribed Africans as \u2018black and flat Nos\u2019d\u2019 with \u2018monstrous thick Lips\u2019 and \u2018soft woolly Hair on their Head\u2019.[CITATION-116] The king\u2019s heavy reliance on Montesquieu, the overlap in terminology with printed travel accounts and the lack of any reference to calls for the abolition of the trade all suggest that the section of his essay on slavery was completed by the 1770s. It is conceivable that he composed the piece in the late 1750s or early 1760s, at a time when he was writing on other legal and governmental issues.[CITATION-117] If so, this indicates that the views he expressed reflected the state of majority opinion on the slave trade in mid-eighteenth-century Britain.Fragmentary evidence dispersed in the Royal Archives contains strong indications of a pro-slavery outlook in some of the king\u2019s decisions. Although no direct policy statements on slavery have yet come to light in George III\u2019s papers, he dealt with the subject more obliquely through decisions concerning geopolitics, the empire and its defence, the economy, property rights and state revenues. While the king did not have any direct investments in slave labour in the plantations, the military forces of the Crown included thousands of \u2018slaves in red coats\u2019 in the last decade of the eighteenth century.[CITATION-118] The king\u2019s concern for order and stability, and his desire to protect the strength of the British Empire against a backdrop of revolutionary changes in Europe and America, disposed him towards maintaining the status quo in regard to slavery.[CITATION-119] For example, when Lord Camden, secretary of state for war and the colonies, proposed in 1805 that \u2018it would be expedient to prohibit the Importation of slaves for the Cultivation of fresh Land into such Colonies or Settlements\u2019 in the Caribbean that might be restored to the French after the war, the king argued that such principles should not be extended to other colonial possessions.[CITATION-120] Concerned that the property rights of British subjects would be adversely affected, he supported the continuance of imports of enslaved Africans into other British islands.[CITATION-121] No measure, he insisted, should be adopted which would \u2018disgrace the honour and justice of the British Legislature which has ever fostered the British Islands and has no more right from ideas of false phylanthropy [] to affect the property of British settlers than it would have to prevent the cultivation of land in Great Britain\u2019.[CITATION-122] The cautious manner in which Lord Camden recommended this policy also hints at the king\u2019s concerns about the slave trade. He emphasised that the measure did not mean coming down on either side of the debate, as \u2018those Persons who are the most favourable & those who are the most adverse to the Abolition of that Trade agree in the Policy of the Order in Council which Lord Camden offers to your Majesty\u2019s Consideration\u2019.[CITATION-123] George III was aware of revenue flowing into the Treasury from the customs duties on sugar. In response to seeing the conspicuous wealth displayed by a Jamaican planter on a journey near Weymouth around 1790, he is alleged to have asked the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, about the duties on \u2018All that sugar!\u2019 As David Richardson notes, the story is apocryphal, but is still useful in highlighting the wealth generated by the sugar islands.[CITATION-124] The importance that the king and his ministers attached to protecting Britain\u2019s Caribbean possessions was informed by military as well as economic considerations. In correspondence with Lord Sandwich in 1779 during the American War of Independence, the king emphasised the urgency of retaining the \u2018sugar Islands\u2019 of Jamaica and Barbados as a means of funding the war.[CITATION-125] When Britain was at war with Revolutionary France in the 1790s, the same concern for protecting the West India islands was stated clearly in the king\u2019s correspondence with his ministers. In the intervening period, the loss of the British colonies in North America sharpened still further his resolve to protect remaining overseas possessions and prevent further losses of influence, market outlets for British goods and supplies of cash crops.[CITATION-126] In the midst of ongoing maritime warfare with France, Henry Dundas, secretary for war, wrote to the king to press the case for increasing British forces in the Caribbean.[CITATION-127] Cabinet minutes from 14 August 1795, preserved in the king\u2019s correspondence, emphasised the need for the vigorous pursuit of war by land and sea. This was seen as \u2018essential to the present and future security of his Majesty\u2019s possessions in that part of the World, and for this purpose it is necessary that preparation be forthwith made for offensive operations both in the Leeward Islands and in the Island of St. Domingo\u2019. The proximity of Saint-Domingue to Jamaica posed a major threat to British interests in the Caribbean and, not surprisingly, the king\u2019s reply on 16 August approved troop increases.[CITATION-128] When Clarence argued in 1807 that abolition would result in the loss of the West Indies and the destruction of the empire, he echoed ideas that his father had emphasised in his policies for at least three decades.[CITATION-129] Ministers were prepared to present the king with requests from Caribbean planters. On 3 January 1805, for example, Lord Camden informed the king that the planters of Grenada were anxious that he had not appointed a lieutenant governor for the island.[CITATION-130] The king responded quickly and proposed several candidates. In contrast, when the king considered matters relating to enslaved Africans, it was usually in terms of their value as property and labour, their recruitment into the army, or the need to control social disorder in British Caribbean possessions. On 23 March 1807, two days before the Abolition Bill received the royal assent, the king expressed alarm at the \u2018Disturbances among the Negroes in Jamaica\u2019.[CITATION-131] Evidence in the Royal Archives points to some ambiguities in the king\u2019s attitudes. It appears that he supported the continuance of the slave trade and slavery, while acknowledging the inhumanity on which the system was based. It is entirely possible that the king was drawing a distinction between his own private morality and public morality, and that he was sympathetic to the moral condemnation of slavery at an intellectual level while justifying it on military and economic grounds.[CITATION-132] Such ambiguities were not unique to George III; clear contradictions were inherent in the views and behaviour of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson on the issue of slavery.[CITATION-133] Accepting that the king\u2019s pragmatism disposed him to a pro-slavery outlook fits more clearly with existing historiography.[CITATION-134] John Cannon commented that George III was \u2018unenthusiastic\u2019 about abolition, and Seymour Drescher noted that the Abolition Bill received only a \u2018reluctant royal assent\u2019.[CITATION-135] The king\u2019s assent to the Abolition Bill in March 1807 raises the question of why, despite his long-standing opposition to abolition, he was willing to accept, or at least swallow, his ministers\u2019 policy recommendation at this juncture.[CITATION-136] As the king was not politically passive or malleable at this stage in his reign, the explanation may lie instead in the major readjustment of abolitionist arguments and political strategy that occurred after 1803.[CITATION-137] This shift in political strategy enabled abolitionists skilfully to represent Britain\u2019s continuing involvement in the slave trade as a threat to national interests and the security of British Caribbean possessions. As a result of these strategic changes, abolitionists were able to \u2018overcome the forces of conservatism that had held abolition in abeyance for over a decade\u2019 by reconciling British self-interest with widespread public sympathy for the plight of enslaved Africans. They achieved this by demonstrating that abolition was \u2018sound policy\u2019, particularly in the wake of the rebellion in Saint-Domingue and the continuing threats posed by warfare with France.[CITATION-138] Abolitionists thereby presented themselves as the \u2018friends rather than enemies of the British West Indian imperial project\u2019. They emphasised how their policies would ensure the preservation of the colonies, an approach that would have appealed to the king\u2019s overriding concern with protecting Britain\u2019s geopolitical position and its wealth and national security.[CITATION-139] Two key international developments may also have helped to allay some of George III\u2019s concerns about the impact of abolition on British Caribbean possessions by 1807. The proclamation of Saint-Domingue as the independent republic of Haiti in 1804 considerably reduced concerns about French threats to Jamaica. By supporting Haiti and showing itself favourable to abolition, Britain could constrain the ambitions of the French in the region and foster stability.[CITATION-140] The prospect of the former American colonies passing legislation to abolish the trade in 1807 was also important, as it removed the possibility that they would expand their imports of enslaved Africans to take up the slack left by Britain.[CITATION-141] The provision in the Abolition Bill to enlist \u2018Liberated Africans\u2019 released from slave ships into the army and Royal Navy might have also allayed some of the king\u2019s concerns about maintaining Britain\u2019s military strength.[CITATION-142] Furthermore, the fact that the measure put forward in 1807 originated with Grenville in the Lords and was not a private bill emphasised that this was a \u2018policy-driven political act rather than a moral one\u2019.[CITATION-143] The opening up of the Georgian Papers has enabled a fuller and more nuanced assessment of the attitudes of the Hanoverian royal family to slavery and abolition than has hitherto been possible. This evidence also has a wider significance, as it touches on long running issues of historiographical debate relating to the king\u2019s political influence and the image of the Georgian monarchy.[CITATION-144] The picture that emerges from the Georgian Papers is of a royal family largely personifying the existence of a pro-slavery culture in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Britain. More than a quarter of a century after Adam Smith set out the merits of free labour over slave labour in(1776), senior members of the royal family could not envisage an empire without the supply of enslaved African labour.[CITATION-145] As ideas of liberty were brought into sharp focus by the age of revolutions across Europe, North America and the Caribbean, George III and his sons remained loath to reconsider enslaved Africans as suitable recipients of freedom.[CITATION-146] There was a considerable degree of unanimity on the issue, and the only obvious dissentient voice in the royal family before 1807 was that of the Duke of Gloucester. He actively promoted policies for the use of Africans released from slave ships as a new and supposedly free form of labour supply in West Africa.[CITATION-147] However, although he was not without influence, Gloucester was low down in the order of precedence in the royal family, and his views carried less political weight than those of the king and his sons.After the trauma of losing the American colonies, the king\u2019s official correspondence indicates that he was at pains to protect British West India interests as pillars of empire.[CITATION-148] In contrast to a number of commentators in Europe and North America, the king appeared largely untroubled by the notion that slavery might be tarnishing Britain\u2019s reputation, even though he appeared to accept the basis of some Enlightenment ideas on slavery.[CITATION-149] While he may have contemplated the idea that the trade was unethical, this was not enough to outweigh his commitment to defending British interests overseas, particularly in a context of warfare with France.[CITATION-150] The Duke of Clarence also prioritised British self-interest over ethical considerations about slavery. He appears to have taken an even harder line than his father and exhibited no trace of reflection on whether Africans should be regarded as fellow humans. His opinions were characterised by an \u2018older mentality of toleration\u2019 of the slave trade, and reflected the types of attitudes that Thomas Clarkson encountered during his visit to Liverpool.[CITATION-151] Clarence and his brothers were taking their political lead from George III. A comment made by Fuller in March 1795 suggests that the \u2018behind-the-scenes opposition\u2019 of the king was pivotal. He commented that \u2018His Majesty is a true Friend to the Colonies. I am of opinion we owe more to him than is generally known in regard to the defeat [of] the absurd attempt of abolishing the Slave Trade\u2019. Fuller, who made this comment shortly after finishing a period of thirty years as agent for Jamaica, was better placed than most observers to assess the king\u2019s views on the subject.[CITATION-152] He did not have a close relationship with the king, but his frequent contact with Clarence no doubt offered valuable insights into the views of the royal family.[CITATION-153] Other commentators in the political arena noted George III\u2019s opposition, including Charles James Fox, who commented in 1802 that abolition would not be secured during the king\u2019s lifetime.[CITATION-154] The king was able, within the constraints of a limited monarchy, to oppose abolition for almost two decades.[CITATION-155] Yet, as David Richardson points out, the \u2018king\u2019s party was not alone in aiding West India interests\u2019 in resisting abolition. Disunity on the issue among prominent government ministers in four governing administrations between 1783 and 1806 was also a key factor which made \u2018its adoption as formal government policy inconceivable before 1806\u20137\u2019. This was the case even though William Pitt, who was sympathetic to abolition, was prime minister for most of this period.[CITATION-156] Nonetheless, the king exercised his political influence on abolition in various direct and indirect ways. By making it perfectly clear that he was opposed to abolition, George III influenced Pitt\u2019s decision not to bring forward such measures for his approval.[CITATION-157] Lord Liverpool was informed by Clarence in 1799 that \u2018it was the King\u2019s determination that any business of this sort should never be made a cabinet measure\u2019.[CITATION-158] The king was able to sway debate through his interaction with his ministers, and by persuading members of the Lords and Commons to oppose abolition on the grounds it would damage British interests.[CITATION-159] Papers among the king\u2019s official correspondence indicate that he monitored voting patterns in the Lords.[CITATION-160] Following a major speech on the Slave Trade Limitation Bill by Clarence, the Prince of Wales was also interested in learning more about patterns of voting on 5 July 1799. Henry Cowper, clerk assistant to the House of Lords, was instructed to report on proceedings, and he subsequently furnished the prince with a list of peers present for the debate and the proxies they held.[CITATION-161] The debate on abolition sheds some further light on the nature of George III\u2019s relationship with his ministers in the last few years of his active reign. His decision not to oppose Grenville\u2019s proposal to introduce a bill in 1807 is also consistent with Dickinson\u2019s assessment that towards the end of his reign it \u2018became increasingly common for his ministers to initiate policy discussions, arrive at conclusions, and, thereafter, they usually secured the king\u2019s agreement without too much difficulty\u2019.[CITATION-162] The king\u2019s decision not to stand in Grenville\u2019s way reflected both the changed political landscape after the death of Pitt in 1806 and the formation of the coalition Ministry of All the Talents, which was \u2018dominated by men who favoured abolition\u2019 and who were able to demonstrate convincingly that the measure was vital to national security.[CITATION-163] It is clear that the views of the royal family on abolition mattered in political terms, despite a complaint by the Duke of Sussex in December 1806 that \u2018It is a melancholy Reflection for the Royal Family that any Borough Purchaser can have more Weight with ministers than them\u2019.[CITATION-164] His peevish comment was made after Grenville opposed his attempts to secure appointments in Jamaica and the Cape Colony but it may also have reflected his irritation at how the new prime minister had made clear his intention to push ahead with abolition.[CITATION-165] Whatever the motivation, the duke was entirely disingenuous in suggesting that the Hanoverian royal family had scant political influence. Abolitionists certainly considered that the lobbying power of the royal dukes was dangerous to their cause. In 1807, Clarkson informed one of his correspondents that it was necessary to \u2018counteract\u2019 the efforts of the princes who \u2018are canvassing against Us, and will do Us much Mischief\u2019.[CITATION-166] Debates in the 1790s reveal that the role of the king\u2019s sons in managing opinion and votes was frequently decisive in blocking, or at least delaying, abolitionist measures. In 1792, Wilberforce also believed that his defeat in the Commons was due in large measure to \u2018the Guelph [royal] family\u2019s being against us\u2019.[CITATION-167] Although royal intervention was no guarantee of success, the agreement by the Prince of Wales not to vote in the debates on abolition in 1807 reveals the significance that Grenville placed on his tacit support, or at least his lack of direct opposition. Conversely, Grenville\u2019s eagerness for Gloucester to be present for debates in the upper chamber further emphasises how the royal dukes still wielded political influence.George III\u2019s growing popularity from the late 1780s appears not to have been dented to any significant extent by the way in which the royal family resisted the clamour for abolition.[CITATION-168] A number of factors explain this apparent paradox. One development that helped to bolster George III\u2019s popularity later in his reign was the public perception that he was playing a less active role in politics. As a result, the blame for unpopular policies was placed on his ministers rather than on the king.[CITATION-169] Besides which, Fuller\u2019s comment in 1795 indicates that the king\u2019s opposition to abolition was not generally known. Against a backdrop of huge support for abolition across Britain, it is significant that George III\u2019s views were not made public, and his sons took on responsibility for opposing the measure.[CITATION-170] After his devastating period of illness in 1788, an upswelling of public sympathy contributed to the king\u2019s growing popularity.[CITATION-171] Against the backdrop of the second mass petitioning campaign of 1792, the king was depicted as the central character in Gillray\u2019s \u2018Anti-saccharrites\u2019 cartoon. In an age of, in which satirists were prepared to adopt a scatological approach to the royal family, Gillray\u2019s treatment of the king was restrained. Brief reference was made to the inhumanity of slavery through Queen Charlotte\u2019s comment about reducing the labour of the \u2018poor Blackeemoors\u2019, but the image emphasised George III\u2019s concern with saving money, a trait that many of his subjects among the middling classes would have viewed as a virtue.[CITATION-172] Gillray could have been far more savage in his treatment of the king if he had made use of the powerful descriptions of African suffering contained in pamphlets by Thomas Clarkson, William Fox and William Roscoe.[CITATION-173] In contrast, the reputation of the Duke of Clarence took a pounding in cartoons and newspaper reports. References to Africans and slavery formed an integral part of visual strategies used to emphasise his immorality and hypocrisy. The portrayal of the prince embracing \u2018Wouski\u2019, a young black woman, in his shipboard hammock in January 1788 may have lost something of its political and cultural force later in the year when the king became ill.[CITATION-174] References to Wouski surfaced again in 1791 and 1792, however, as a basis for attacking the duke\u2019s relationship with the actress Mrs Dorothy Jordan. The duke\u2019s infidelities were highlighted in the \u2018Story of Nell\u2019s Coach\u2019 by William Dent in 1791, as \u2018Wowski\u2019 is shown warning Mrs Jordan that he will leave her for another, as \u2018Massa love me once, now he love you\u2019.[CITATION-175] More scandalous still was \u2018Symptoms of Cruelty\u2019, a print in which a partly clothed Clarence, in a punishment collar, is shown being whipped by Mrs Jordan. Direct comment on the duke\u2019s hypocrisy is made through the description of the scene as \u2018A Representation of the manner of Treatment of the Slaves in the West Indies\u2014or an Advocate for the Slave Trade receiving a Taste\u2019.[CITATION-176] The duke\u2019s attendance at the notorious trial of John Kimber, a slave ship captain, for the murder of an enslaved woman, in June 1792 as one of his \u2018friends\u2019 would have further increased public criticism of his hypocrisy.[CITATION-177] The duke\u2019s dissolute behaviour was no doubt galling to supporters of abolition, many of whom were of an evangelical turn of mind and wished to see a reformation of morals across the nation. Such biting criticism by Dent and other satirists must have tarnished not only the duke\u2019s reputation, but also the image of royalty in the minds of at least some observers. In their attitudes to the Hanoverian royal family, however, the public appeared willing to draw a clear distinction between the king\u2019s qualities and the behaviour of his sons. Criticism of his sons\u2019 moral failings only served to increase the king\u2019s popularity by emphasising his many virtues.[CITATION-178] The speeches of the king\u2019s abolitionist nephew, Gloucester, went some way towards protecting the royal family\u2019s reputation on the question of abolition by the first decade of the nineteenth century. His maiden speech in 1806 marked an important shift, whereby members of the royal family represented both sides of debate in the upper chamber. The inscrutability of the king\u2019s views on slavery meant that abolitionists and anti-abolitionists could choose who they thought most closely represented the outlook of the monarch.In the immediate aftermath of abolition, George III and Gloucester were given some credit in popular imagery for the passage of the measure. In George Cruikshank\u2019spublished in 1807, George III was depicted on a gold throne holding out his hand to a diverse gathering of men, women and children from across the globe. A kneeling African is shown holding a large ivory tusk under his arm, and another man wearing a turban is shown approaching the throne with gifts. An African child is depicted holding a red banner with the words \u2018Slave Trade Abolished\u2019.[CITATION-179] This brightly coloured etching built on the popular view of the king as the father of Britons, and depicted him as the head of a family of nations drawn from various territories of the British empire. Ships in the background symbolised not only the commercial prosperity of the maritime nation ruled over by George III, but also the strength and protection offered by the Royal Navy. Wearing a jewelled crown, ermine and velvet, the king is portrayed as a dispenser of liberty and happiness to his imperial family.[CITATION-180] An engraving celebrating the passage of abolition in 1807 did not include any direct reference to the king, but the role of the royal family was recognised through its dedication to the Duke of Gloucester. Although Wilberforce, illuminated by celestial light on the right-hand side of the image, was given the main credit for abolition, George III still benefited from some of the reflected glory. By depicting Britannia \u2018trampling on the emblems of slavery\u2019, the print celebrated British achievements of liberty and justice.[CITATION-181] The portrayal of \u2018triumphant Britannia\u2019 was also closely associated with national celebrations of naval victories, which provided a rich vein of patriotic support for the king.[CITATION-182] Abolition thereby furnished another source of national pride, setting Britons apart from the French.[CITATION-183] Despite the king\u2019s sustained opposition to abolition for almost two decades, the passage of the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807 further cemented his popular reputation as a defender of liberty. These images stood in direct contrast to the way the Declaration of Independence more than three decades earlier had portrayed George III as \u2018the tyrant responsible for the American Revolution\u2019.[CITATION-184] Abolition, although occurring towards the end of his active reign, further reinforced \u2018the apotheosis of George III\u2019.[CITATION-185] As Jeremy Black has noted, however, the slave trade is one of the factors that explains \u2018why George\u2019s reign has an ambiguous, not to say contentious, memory across part of the world\u2019.[CITATION-186] Taking the period between George III\u2019s accession and the abolition of the trade, British ships transported more than 1.5 million Africans into slavery. More than 200,000 of these individuals perished during the Atlantic crossing.[CITATION-187] There is no doubt that the king and his sons used their political influence in various practical ways to defend the wealth and property rights of Caribbean planters, as well as the commercial freedom of British slave merchants to profit from the forced transportation of enslaved Africans. The role of the royal family in supporting slavery and delaying abolition had a tangible human impact on the number of Africans uprooted and displaced by the trade. Based on their ideological support for slavery and their commitment to defending Britain\u2019s geopolitical interests, they used their individual and collective influence to oppose measures they thought would weaken the colonies, and by extension the British Empire. By so doing, they threw their weight and influence behind the West India interest, thereby bolstering its \u2018formidable lobbying force\u2019.[CITATION-188] The funeral of Wilberforce suggests that some of the old fissures within the royal family remained more than a quarter of a century after the passage of the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. William IV (formerly the Duke of Clarence) did not attend the funeral of his old adversary at Westminster Abbey in August 1833, although the Duke of Gloucester served as one of the pallbearers. The pro-slavery stance of the Duke of Sussex appears to have shifted in intervening years, as he was among the \u2018Friends of the Late William Wilberforce\u2019 who raised money for a memorial in September 1833.[CITATION-189] Later the same month, and approximately three decades after receiving the Jamaica Service, William IV gave his assent to the Slave Emancipation Act in 1833. Although his attitudes to this legislation are outside the scope of this article, it remains clear that the arguments he used to campaign against abolition during his father\u2019s reign continued to shape pro-slavery opinion during the 1820s and 1830s.[CITATION-190] "

    "title": "Espionage and the 1935 Press War in Palestine: Revisiting Factionalism, Forgeries and Fake News*",
    "author": "Steven Wagner",
    "date": "30 August 2023",
    "text": "In 1935, Palestinian newspapers published a forged letter alleged to have been sent from pan-Islamist leader, Shakib Arslan, to the Palestinian leader and Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husayni. The letter indicated that Husayni and Arslan accepted Italian bribes in exchange for pro-Italian articles in the publications they controlled. Italy was widely despised for its treatment of Libyan Muslims, and so exposing this relationship was expected to be controversial. Amid a national debate about Italy\u2019s imminent invasion of Abyssinia, and its role in the Eastern Mediterranean, Husayni\u2019s Palestinian opponents hoped to embarrass him as a sell-out. Both a government official and national leader, Husayni\u2019s true position came to define the Palestinian debate about the national interest: should Palestinians co-operate with one oppressive empire so as to free themselves from another? Relying on multilingual and multinational archival evidence, this article proves that the letter was indeed forged, but based on real intelligence gathered by Husayni\u2019s Palestinian opponents who sought to damage his reputation. It also shows that British intelligence probably encouraged the forgery, hoping to expose and stem Italian propaganda activity. The scheme backfired and accelerated Italian interference in Palestine. It crystalised Husayni\u2019s popularity, as Palestinians believed he could deliver national liberation. They did not care if Italy was involved. This episode shows that British assessments of \u2018factional\u2019 Palestinian politics reflected their shallow understanding of these conflicts. Meanwhile, it also sheds unique light on Palestinian espionage and counterintelligence work, and the way in which it empowered Husayni and Arslan.During the spring of 1935, a bitter controversy captured the front pages of Palestinian Arabic newspapers. Palestinian opposition parties and their newspapers published a letter which purported to be from the pan-Islamist anti-colonial leader Shakib Arslan (1869\u20131946) to the Palestinian leader, the Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husayni (1897\u20131974), which detailed the pair\u2019s collaboration with Italian propagandists in exchange for a subsidy, or, as it was widely considered, a bribe. The scandal was twofold. As notables, Arslan and Husayni were embarrassed to appear to need money. Additionally, newspapers had closely covered Italian oppression of Muslims in Libya during 1923\u201332\u2014including soldiers\u2019 violence, displacement of Libyan settlements, and disease-ridden concentrations camps. Since 1911, Italian imperialism in the region had bred deep resentment. Husayni was emerging, with Arslan\u2019s vocal support, as a national and regional organiser and leader, having convened a pan-Islamic congress in Jerusalem in late 1931. So, if the letter had been genuine, Palestinian readers of the news might reasonably conclude that Arslan and Husayni had failed ethically and morally by taking Italian money at the expense of Libyan Muslim interests.According to William Cleveland\u2019s study of Shakib Arslan\u2019s anti-imperialist struggle, Arslan\u2019s sentiments were accurately reflected in the letter. Cleveland speculates, as did many of Arslan\u2019s contemporaries, that financial distress motivated Arslan\u2019s sudden turn to support Mussolini.[CITATION-1] Indeed, Arslan complained to correspondents about his finances.[CITATION-2] His rapprochement with Italy was a response to Mussolini\u2019s campaign to promote Fascist ideology and pro-Italian sentiment throughout the eastern Mediterranean. To support Italian ambitions for both spiritual and material expansion, propaganda recruited local support through radio broadcasts, newspapers, student exchanges, cultivating elite support and other activities. It sought to \u2018challenge the British imperial and mandatory system from within\u2019. To that end, Italy strengthened bonds with anti-colonial movements in British and French-held territory. Although some British officials were dismissive, those who were alarmed still lacked the means to contain Italian influence.[CITATION-3] To help counter Italy\u2019s campaign, Britain supported Palestinian covert action, in which a forged letter was to be used to embarrass Arslan and Husayni. The Palestinian forgers hoped that, by exposing his ties to a hostile Christian empire, they could damage Husayni\u2019s reputation as both a Palestinian national leader and as an emerging pan-Islamic leader. If the letter was authentic, then it would provide evidence to the increasingly well-organised nationalist youth movements that Husayni, Arslan and their elite class were not fit to lead. At this time, Palestinian national discourse was shifting its focus away from undoing British support for Zionism and towards ending Mandatory rule and the foundation of an independent Palestinian state. Many Palestinians believed that supporting Italy, with all its expansionist ambitions, was a risk to that national project\u2014even if Britain was their common enemy.This article offers conclusive proof that, despite their denials, Husayni\u2019s Palestinian opponents forged the letter. However, it argues that the forgery was based on genuine intelligence seen by Palestinian agents. Husayni\u2019s political opponents decided to publish the forgery after discussions with British intelligence officers, who shared their distrust of Husayni and who hoped to curb Italian propaganda activity. However, this rare illustration of Palestinian espionage and covert action failed to stem Italian propaganda activity or to damage the Mufti\u2019s reputation, and, in fact, had the opposite effect on both. Instead of casting doubt on Husayni, Arslan and the leadership organs they controlled, the episode revived faith in them. Palestinians ultimately trusted Husayni more than the opposition. They saw him as a strategic thinker and national leader, and his opponents as petty and self-interested. This episode proved to Husayni\u2019s many doubters that he was prepared to resist Britain covertly, and at great reputational risk. It offers uniquely well-documented insight into how Palestinians gathered and used intelligence during the British Mandate, and how this episode left a lasting fracture among leading politicians.The question of forgery is examined here through an analysis of Arslan\u2019s handwriting, using samples from 1929, 1935 and 1944. Additionally, Arslan\u2019s own arguments about the forgery are examined against an analysis of the evidence available. The analysis shows that John Patrick \u2018Pat\u2019 Domvile, the Air Staff Intelligence chief in Jerusalem, received intelligence on the Mufti\u2019s connections to Italy from the Opposition leader Fakhri Nashashibi and encouraged him to publish it. Using a lie to tell the truth, the pair hoped to damage Husayni\u2019s reputation as a nationalist leader and expose Italian interference in Palestinian politics.This article provides an original and revised account of Palestinian intelligence gathering. It adopts a broad definition of intelligence, that is: information of political import, usually kept secret, which is obtained from open or secret sources. \u2018Intelligence\u2019 may also refer to the individuals and institutions which trade in it. Recent declassifications from archives in the United States, United Kingdom and Israel have made this research possible. A large collection of files produced by the Palestine government, but found in the Central Zionist Archive, are central to the arguments in this article.[CITATION-4] Secret files of the High Commissioner and his Chief Secretary contain intelligence reports from the Palestine Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, or MI6) office in Jerusalem (known locally as X2), Air Staff Intelligence (ASI) and other bodies. Such records are normally withheld or destroyed, but a mole in the Chief Secretary\u2019s office seems likely to have supplied these materials to the Jewish Agency for Palestine\u2014the semi-autonomous governing body of the Yishuv, or Jewish community of Palestine.[CITATION-5] So, these records survived in Israeli archives. Further CID materials were preserved among the India Office Records at the British Library.Seen together, these records reveal core disagreements between civil and military officials on Husayni\u2019s role in the national movement, and the nature of the threat that movement posed. Domvile and his colleagues failed to convince the High Commissioner, Arthur Wauchope, or his Chief Secretary, John Hathorn Hall, that Husayni presented a growing threat. Perhaps this spurred ASI\u2019s involvement with the forgery. Wauchope and Hall disparaged Domvile\u2019s reports, but appreciated the SIS officer\u2019s work. Hall\u2019s assistant, Sydney Moody, recorded:My own personal opinion is that the S.S. [Secret Service] reports are much more useful than the RAF [ASI] intelligence reports. For one thing, any information the latter furnish has usually been anticipated either by the S.S. or the Police; and for another, the S.S. intelligence has a wider view and scope \u2026 [They] are a real, independent check on the situation.[CITATION-6] SIS\u2019s small establishment was in danger of closure around the time that this scandal broke out. The scant records on that matter are not clear as to why the SIS station head, Major John Shelley, was ordered to close down operations, but the order was rescinded by May 1935 after the intervention of civil secretaries under the High Commissioner and Chief Secretary.[CITATION-7] SIS reports are scarce, but discrepancies in ASI and CID reporting help to illustrate some facts in the forgery case. Domvile alienated British government officials but was close with Zionist intelligence sources. The future founding chief of Mossad, Reuven Zaslani (later Shiloah), worked for Pat Domvile at ASI, while simultaneously managing intelligence work for the Jewish Agency\u2019s political department. On Domvile, Zionist leader Dov Hoz told Zaslani: \u2018I think he is the best Zionist evangelist toward the English in Palestine\u2019.[CITATION-8] US intelligence records also play a role in this analysis. In 2005, the CIA\u2019s six-volume file on the Mufti was declassified.[CITATION-9] It contains a report on the forgery case, prepared in 1943 by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which will be discussed later. US intelligence captured Husayni\u2019s wartime archive in 1945. They allowed Zionist intelligence officers to take microfilm copies in 1946 and, remarkably, do not seem to have shared the material with Britain. Israeli-held copies were declassified in 2006, although only catalogued and made available in 2013. Part of the collection remained uncatalogued until 2019, and other parts are reportedly damaged.[CITATION-10] The private archive of the Mufti from 1940 to 1945 provides crucial evidence about Arslan\u2019s perspective on the case.There is a general dearth of evidence from original Arabic sources. The Mufti\u2019s archive is a breakthrough for researchers in that regard, but nonetheless, access to other Arabic records is difficult because records have been plundered or destroyed and there is no central Palestinian archive to maintain such records. The Mufti\u2019s papers are not like other colonial archives. They were discovered, not plundered, by the US army in search of an indicted Nazi war criminal. Yet the US lost the originals and the only surviving records available were shared with the Zionists in 1946, who used them selectively to damage the Palestinian case at the UN in 1947, and again during Israel\u2019s trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961.[CITATION-11] So, they still present major problems, and it is helpful that there has been a revived scholarly discussion of colonial records and Palestinian loss of control over these sources.[CITATION-12] This article attempts to address these problems by incorporating Arslan\u2019s own account of the forgery episode across the available record, especially in his letters to the Moroccan nationalist Muhammad Dawwud, which were preserved by the latter\u2019s family.[CITATION-13] Arabic sources such as these offset the skewing effect of the colonial intelligence archives. That skewing effect previously led me, and many other scholars, to dismiss the forgery episode and subsequent press war (in which the parties involved battled out their differences in the newspapers) as unimportant, because, forged or not, the contents of these embarrassing letters revealed the truth about Italy\u2019s relationships with Shakib Arslan and Hajj Amin al-Husayni. It is all too easy to see this as an episode in the narrative of Palestinian factionalism when the truth is much more complex, and important to our understanding of Palestinian political aspirations.So, the details of this case matter. They mattered to Arslan, who resented his slanderers for the rest of his life. They mattered to Husayni, who may have attempted murder in retaliation. He became notorious for that practice. Although few could appreciate it at the time, this episode undermined democratic political processes in Palestine. When we compare original Arabic records with colonial intelligence records, perhaps the clearest available account of Palestinian intelligence gathering emerges. Stunningly, Arslan correctly named the senior British intelligence official who supported the scheme, Pat Domvile. That the British never detected these networks reveals the limits to their ability to understand Palestinian resistance. While colonial forces wielded powerful intelligence bureaucracies against Palestinians and their pan-Arab partners, it should be clear from this case that Palestinians also traded in intelligence to great effect.British surveillance records offer a partial account of the development of Palestinian strategy. Seen alongside Arabic evidence, the relationship between that strategy and the burgeoning political parties, newspapers and propaganda becomes clearer. All British intelligence agencies monitored Italian activity in the region. In April 1934, the CID reported that, although Italy was widely disliked for its policy in Libya, and despite its rumoured (and true) agreements with multiple Zionist parties, Italian propaganda was starting to gain some attention: \u2018This has been explained by a well informed source as being due to Arab despair in British rule\u2019. Mussolini, with Shakib Arslan\u2019s help, had organised a \u2018conference of Oriental students\u2019 in Rome in December 1933. This educational exchange programme was part of Italy\u2019s attempt to promote itself and Fascism in the region. The conference was the start of a wider campaign. The CID noted \u2018[t]he consular authorities in Palestine seem to be busy and reported now and then to have held conversations with political leaders from the Mufti downwards\u2019. It also reported that Arslan and his partner at the Syro-Palestinian Congress in Geneva, Ihsan Jabiri, also lived on Italian government subsidies: \u2018[t]his explains reports about an agreement with a foreign power, in anticipation of a European war, for which Ihsan Jabiri was said to have visited Arab countries\u2019.[CITATION-14] This agreement refers to the, or National Pact, which was first discussed in January 1932 on the sidelines of the Jerusalem pan-Islamic Congress. Veteran politicians agreed that Syrians and Palestinians should take advantage of the brewing crises in Europe. They hoped to leverage the influence of independent Arab states during a European war to demand independence for all Arabs. The pact planned to exploit a future European war and seek foreign assistance towards gaining independence for Syria and Palestine. Italy promised to play that part, but Palestinians were sceptical.[CITATION-15] Although some were attracted to the modernising promise of Fascism, Palestinian leaders had consistently called for true representative democracy since the start of British rule.[CITATION-16] Fascist Italy produced no ideological partnership. Rather, Arslan and Palestinian politicians anticipated exploiting such a moment for their own interests.In 1934, the Italian consul general began systematically to establish relationships with Arab leaders in order \u2018to efface the ill-effects which Italian policy in Tripolitania had on Arab minds\u2019. Arslan\u2019s bargain with Italy was yet another wedge between Britain and Italy during the Abyssinian crisis. From his point of view, the deal was paying off. Echoing Arslan\u2019s rebuttals in the press, the CID remarked that conditions in Tripolitania had improved recently and that Italy had begun to support the Syro-Palestinian congress\u2019s arguments against Britain and France at the League of Nations. Although popular opinion was shifting, many pan-Arabists remained sceptical of Italy\u2019s intentions and its ability to help. Even if it could not win over a majority of Palestinians, Italy still enjoyed the fruits of its partnership with Arslan. Ihsan Jabiri had actively been gathering intelligence for the Italians since his arrival in Palestine in February 1935. The CID optimistically reported that Palestinian papers ceased pro-Italian propaganda as a result of the forgery controversy, but this lull would not last. Wauchope feared that the main effect of the propaganda was likely to be increased hostility towards Britain.[CITATION-17] As events unfolded in the six months prior to the Palestinian General Strike and Revolt in April 1936, it became clear that Britain was capable of arousing Palestinian resistance without any help from Italy.The forgery episode addresses \u2018factional\u2019 Palestinian politics as a historiographical issue. British and Zionist observers often characterised Palestinian national politics as factional for a range of reasons. This was part of a divide-and-rule tactic that began in the 1920s to curb nationalist organisation.[CITATION-18] Scholars who share this frame of analysis tend to oversimplify disagreement and conflict within Palestinian nationalism, and to restrict their analyses to elite groups.In 1982, Salim Tamari showed that, by characterising Palestinian politics in this period as \u2018factional\u2019, scholars are reusing the polarising categories imposed by capitalist and colonial forces during the Mandate period. Tamari does not reject the term, but instead offers a nuanced picture of how these categories emerged. The \u2018factional\u2019 category of politics \u2018deflected\u2019 class politics, and overlooked categories such as confession, ideology, clan or region. Factionalism over-emphasises the self-interestedness of Palestinian elites, who, Tamari suggests, perhaps ought not to be thought of as a homogeneous group. Factionalism incapacitated Palestinian resistance to colonisation and is often considered to be a source for disunity and disintegration during the Palestinian, or catastrophe of 1948.[CITATION-19] Broadly, scholars of Palestine recognise the importance of factions while cautioning against the repetition of a colonial trope designed to condescend towards the Palestinian capacity for self-government.[CITATION-20] This article intends to focus on elites, and to examine fully the evidence about the breaking point in Husayni\u2019s relations with his rivals. It shows how these competing groups navigated national liberation and the geopolitical competition between Italy and Britain. To British observers, the episode reinforced the narrative of factionalism. To an extent, it also crystallised a factional reality between pro- and anti-Husayni camps. Although this study examines factions, it tries to use more specific and, arguably, more helpful categories to describe these varying interest groups. The forgery case illuminates factionalism as an issue in Palestinian and colonial politics, but it does not mindlessly reiterate the trope of factional Palestinian elites. Instead, it offers more intimate and nuanced understanding of a severe break in relations between Husayni and his opponents. It also shows that this break was not the defining characteristic of Palestinian politics, even during the press war.Although widely popular, the Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husayni, divided opinion among elites and middle classes. He skyrocketed to officialdom at the age of 24, lacking scholarly credentials, after a grand bargain struck between his family and the High Commissioner Herbert Samuel. In 1918\u201320 the military government sacked the Husaynis from the mayoralty and other posts in Jerusalem for supporting nationalist revolution. In 1921, Samuel appointed Hajj Amin as \u2018Grand Mufti\u2019 of Palestine\u2014the most senior independent jurist qualified to issue, or. Later that year, Husayni was also elected president (by an irregular procedure which amounted to appointment) of the British-created Supreme Muslim Council (SMC). It was set up to control the Islamic Trusts or(pl.)\u2014a major source for revenue.[CITATION-21] Samuel\u2019s \u2018grand bargain\u2019 exploited existing factions in Jerusalem in a classic divide-and-rule strategy. Samuel also hoped to neutralise Husayni as a popular nationalist organiser. For a time, he succeeded.With these two posts, Husayni wielded enormous powers of patronage over Palestinian social, civil and religious life. This broke traditional power structures. Husayni controlled two large government budgets and the power to hire and fire government officials working in the Shari\u2018a courts, any religious office, education and other influential areas of public life. From late 1931, Husayni established an independent pan-Islamic congress in Jerusalem. This added a third national instrument to his portfolio. The congress and its budget were not subject to British scrutiny. This incredible concentration of power in his hands inspired an opposition faction, or, to Husayni\u2019s, or \u2018council\u2019 faction. The opposition consisted of rival families, especially the Nashashibis, as well as communities which sought to represent alternative regional, economic and even theological or jurisprudential interests. A number of, or Islamic scholars, considered themselves to belong to the opposition.During the early 1930s Britain subsidised Husayni\u2019s SMC budget in exchange for his overt support for the government during a widespread civil disobedience campaign, led by a younger generation of nationalist leaders. This freed up further finance to support popular resistance secretly and attract more popular support for himself. The Palestine government tended to see the Mufti as an important agent of influence, who, if nurtured correctly, could stabilise radicals among Palestinian nationalists and lead the movement to eventual self-government. In 1934, the SMC received large payments from the government in exchange for Hajj Amin\u2019s co-operation and moderating influence over the radical parties.[CITATION-22] This moderation ended after the radical youth parties broadly backed Husayni for supporting Italy\u2014probably to his surprise.His role as national organiser has received revived scholarly attention and debate.[CITATION-23] Although his appointments were colonial impositions, by 1935 he was reaching the peak of his popularity. The reasons for this are hard to discern, as he enjoyed widespread support among the peasantry, who left few records behind on the topic. Oral testimony, such as that recorded by Ted Swedenberg, seems to focus on Palestinians\u2019 admiration for his national leadership, and emphasises the national interest. They regarded the squabbles of political elites as a Jerusalem problem\u2014not a national one.[CITATION-24] Indeed, even as an emerging leader, before he was Mufti, Hajj Amin and his cousin and confidant, Jamal al-Husayni, personally visited villages near Jerusalem to report political news and to engage a popular audience.[CITATION-25] This illiterate but politically active peasant majority was the Mufti\u2019s base of support.Palestinian political parties emerged during the early 1930s as politics transformed to incorporate mass movements which had grown since 1928, when youth and labour movements began to grow. Coincidentally, competing Muslim and Jewish grievances over the \u2018Wailing Wall\u2019 or \u2018Buraq\u2019 in Jerusalem led the former to a short-lived revolt, which spread across the country in August 1929, prompting a military response. The \u2018Buraq Revolt\u2019, which saw massacres of Jewish communities in Safad and Hebron, galvanised popular support for the defence of Muslim holy sites and focused Palestinian attention on the danger of Britain\u2019s Zionist policy. Propaganda and publishing were central to party politics. Factional rivalry found partisan expression, but most parties focused on various campaigns to resist British policy. The forgery scandal placed incredible factional pressure on these parties.The first two parties to emerge were the Youth Congress (often called Youngmen in English sources) in August 1931, and theor \u2018independence\u2019 party, founded the next summer. The Youth Congress promoted a civil disobedience campaign modelled on that in India, having concluded that the older national institutions were failing to resist Zionism and imperialism. The Palestine Istiqlal Party joined that radical activist thrust. Both parties pressured elites to join their boycott and disobedience campaigns. Istiqlal had more elite organisers in its ranks, but both were youth-led. These parties won over the support of the Nablus-based \u2018National Bloc\u2019 in 1935\u2014a party established to balance the domination of Jerusalemite families on the national scene.The Bloc and other parties emerged following the death in 1934 of the Palestinian elder statesman, Musa Kazim al-Husayni, after British police beat him severely during demonstrations in late 1933. Unable to elect a new leader, and looking ahead to the eighth Palestine Arab Congress (which was never held), the Congress\u2019s Executive Committee encouraged the establishment of parties.[CITATION-26] The first one to centre on Jerusalem was the liberal \u2018reform\u2019 party, founded and led by Dr Hussein Khalidi. It was first aligned with Husayni\u2019s opponents. However, in 1934 Hajj Amin persuaded Khalidi to run against Ragheb Nashashibi in the mayoral elections in Jerusalem. In the election campaign, the Nashashibis published Nazi-influenced, anti-Jewish propaganda in their newspaper,, hoping to attract more nationalist support. Fakhri Nashashibi began to model his nascent party on Mussolini\u2019s Fascist party. This backfired, and his opposition faction alienated both Jewish and Muslim voters. In a well-co-ordinated propaganda campaign in the Palestinian press,papers, some opposition papers and the Hebrew press all supported Khalidi\u2019s candidacy. Ragheb Nashashibi lost the mayoralty, in what the CID described as the Mufti\u2019s \u2018master stroke\u2019.[CITATION-27] The Nashashibi family, which led the opposition faction, had lost its remaining official government posts. Reeling, in January 1935 they and other opposition leaders formally established Hizb al-Difa\u2018 al-Watani, the National Defence Party, also known as al-Difa\u2018 (not to be confused with the newspaper of the same name). They also began a semi-secret partnership with the Jewish Agency.The Mufti\u2019s domination of the SMC, the Islamic Trusts, the Jerusalem pan-Islamic Congress and other important bodies now extended to most national bodies and civil posts. In late March 1935, Jamal al-Husayni quit the defunct national institutions which had been set up during 1918\u201320, and founded the Palestine Arab Party (PAP) to consolidate his family\u2019s dominating position and to bring more official Husayni representation into a nascent Palestinian party system. According to Bayan al-Hout, PAP\u2019s first aim\u2014to end the Mandate and make Palestine independent\u2014made it the most popular party.[CITATION-28] PAP was distinguished for its Palestinian nationalist agenda, rather than the hybrid national and pan-Arab programme of Istiqlal. Some leaders later hoped these new parties could flourish in anticipation of constitutional reform promised by the High Commissioner, which, if it had not failed in 1936 prior to the Palestinian revolt, would have established a legislature. Without an official organising body, parties never acquired \u2018electoral legitimacy\u2019 and, according to Bayan al-Hout, essentially formed three blocs.[CITATION-29] These parties had more in common than not. They were all ambitious nationalists. The Mufti\u2019s leadership and political skills, and those of Jamal, produced a coherent strategy for their party which distinguished it from its rivals. This, perhaps, is the key reason for its popularity. The Mufti and his party did not seek popularity for popularity\u2019s sake. Instead they used (and dominated) any available national instruments to advance the cause. These included newspapers, clubs, official offices and other media. By 1935, Husayni\u2019s domination of public offices across Palestine had anchored his power as popular support grew.Although some news editors worried about Italian intentions in the region, many younger politicians embraced Husayni and Arslan\u2019s realism and welcomed Italian support. The strategic crises faced by Britain and France during 1935\u20136 presented Arab independence movements with an opportunity to break free, and to model the Arab national project on the successes of revisionist European states, especially Italy.Until the forgery scandal and press war, many members of the Palestinian elite feared Husayni\u2019s monopolisation of government offices and his dramatic rise in power and influence. The Nashashibi-led National Defence Party spearheaded efforts in 1935 to counter him, having recently lost ground in the municipal and council elections to parties aligned with thefaction. They attacked his reputation in the press, aiming to curb his influence.Winning over the popular opinion of Istiqlal and other radical youth movements was probably the most important prize of the press war. These readers were not exclusively loyal to a single newspaper, party or faction. PAP and Difa\u2018 needed youth support, yet the scandal also exposed the need for solidarity among the leading parties. Until the press war, opinions were fluid and all parties were jockeying to become the leading element of a mass movement. Difa\u2018 destroyed its chances to win over mass support after its pro-Nazi expressions. Likewise, al-Faruqi\u2019s paper,, had published a number of pro-Italian articles before it discovered that Arslan and Husayni had already sided with Britain\u2019s regional rival.[CITATION-30] The forgery episode illustrates that partisanship was not as rigid as often depicted by historians, although the bitter struggle for public opinion paradoxically helped create that impression.Many scholars have studied the role of the Palestinian press in national activity and factional conflict.[CITATION-31] Palestinian newspapers emerged from the early nationalist or proto-nationalist movement of the late Ottoman period. They were typically owned by notable families and leaned towards nationalism, but also tended to represent the specific interest of the owning family.Most Palestinians were not fully literate at this time, but could gain access to news and newspapers through a range of public communal means.[CITATION-32] Elites were often intermediaries for news, especially as publishers. Religious, scholastic, labour and other types of leaders played these roles.[CITATION-33] The spread of radio receivers in the 1930s changed these novel structures, to some extent. Nonetheless, these papers shaped political discourse, especially during 1935 when they began to form along partisan lines. Thus, newspapers were a fertile ground on which parties could carve out their positions and attack their opponents. These debates reflected real and significant issues for Palestinian nationalism, such as questions of leadership, strategy, resistance, nation-building, economic progress and social welfare. However, debates could also be interpreted as reflecting personal and petty disputes between rival elite families, especially in Jerusalem.Husayni\u2019s opponents who publicised the forgery seem to have done so as a result of their suspicions of Husayni and of Italian influence, rather than from pro-British convictions. For example, \u2018Isa Daoud al-\u2018Isa, owner of the newspaper, moved to Beirut in 1939, having survived an assassination attempt (probably ordered by Husayni) in 1936, and lived there until his death in 1950. According to his memoir, \u2018Isa maintained good relations with Hajj Amin. He met him while he was a student at al-Azhar in Cairo before the First World War, and afterwards in Damascus during Faysal\u2019s short-lived government there. He found him on both occasions to be an engaged nationalist, but noted that his opinion of him worsened after his irregular appointment as Mufti, and even more so as he used the offices of the Mufti and SMC to \u2018dominate the executive committee and control all its decisions\u2019. \u2018Isa began to publish critiques of Hajj Amin, and he was not alone. By 1934, \u2018Isa supported the foundation of Hizb al-Difa\u2018 and was among its leaders.[CITATION-34] Shaykh Sulayman al-Taji al-Faruqi foundedin 1932. Faruqi was an, or religious scholar, unlike Husayni. He was also a journalist and a long-standing opponent of Zionism. He was a key organiser of the Palestine Arab Congress in 1920, but found himself excluded from prominent positions in favour of Husayni\u2019s relatives.[CITATION-35] He was a firm opponent of Husayni\u2019s concentration of power. Although his paper adopted a pan-Islamist, anti-colonialist perspective, it attracted a younger, more radical nationalist readership and supported their calls for a boycott of British and Jewish goods. It was especially popular among those youth activists who founded Istiqlal. The newspaper became their unofficial medium for disseminating their ideas.[CITATION-36] Like \u2018Isa and al-Faruqi, Istiqlalists criticised the Mufti for his apparent collaboration with Britain as a government officer, and his reluctance to voice support for nationalist campaigns.In publishing the forged letter, editors such as al-\u2018Isa and al-Faruqi were responding to a series of articles published in March and April of 1935 by Shakib Arslan, one of the Mufti\u2019s mentors and key international allies. Arslan\u2019s articles in the Husayni-owned newspaperpraised Italy\u2019s support for Arslan\u2019s Syro-Palestinian Congress at the League of Nations. Arslan was a prominent pan-Islamist writer, journalist, activist and diplomat. He was the region\u2019s leading anti-imperialist voice in both Arabic and French. Many Palestinian readers thought Arslan\u2019s defence of Rome\u2019s policy towards Ethiopia was a strange about-face. Arslan rose to prominence attacking Italy\u2019s invasion of Libya in 1911 and his change of mind was noteworthy.[CITATION-37] Opposition papers began to attackfor its sudden support for Italian imperialism in East Africa. The erstwhile liberal debate on that topic became partisan.On 18 April 1935, al-Faruqi published a letter inthat, he alleged, was written by Shakib Arslan to the Mufti of Jerusalem. Faruqi was an erstwhile admirer of Arslan, but was sceptical of his pro-Italian advocacy and especially of what appeared to be Arslan\u2019s attempt to include the Mufti in that campaign. The letter seemed to prove Arslan and Husayni\u2019s hypocrisy. He shared widespread discomfort with Husayni\u2019s uneducated pan-Islamic leadership and his rising power. Faruqi published the letter because it showed that Arslan and the Mufti were receiving an Italian subsidy in exchange for their pro-Italian propaganda, and that Arslan was encouraging the Mufti to cease co-operation with Britain and turn towards resistance. Other newspapers, includingandreproduced the letter over the following days.[CITATION-38] The day before the news broke in Palestine, on 17 April 1935, the Egyptian daily\u2014historically pro-British\u2014published an extract of the same letter.[CITATION-39] This last point is a clue to the British link to the scandal.The press war escalated as another letter was published. This one was alleged to have been sent from Arslan to \u2018Abbas Hilmi II, the ex-Khedive of Egypt, and purported to show the pair\u2019s collusion with Italy.[CITATION-40] Arslan complained to the Syrian-Egyptian publisher Rose al-Yusuf, \u2018Now, after I have disproved their shameful forgery and public opinion knows that the letter is forged, they are again repeating their failure by publishing this correspondence\u2019. Embarrassed that the letter exposed his money problems, he thought the whole sixty-letter correspondence would save his reputation.[CITATION-41] Clearly, at issue was not just the question of Italian policy. For Arslan, this was about both his stature and the integrity of his strategy. Within Palestine, it was about whether the national movement ought to side openly with a hostile Christian empire and Britain\u2019s main regional rival. The Mufti\u2019s power and influence were at the centre of the storm.Until this point, the Mufti\u2019s connection to Italy had been a well-kept secret. His exposure bywas embarrassing. The obviousness of the forgery was his first lifeline. Husayni and Arslan vigorously argued that the letter was forged and denied being Italian agents. Both threatened lawsuits and consulted handwriting experts to prove the forgery.[CITATION-42] Arslan defended himself by writing letters to Palestinian newspapers and to the government. He appealed to the latter to lift his ban on entry to Palestine so that he could bring the case to court. The government rejected that appeal, as it still considered him a dangerous and subversive dissident.Among the Mufti\u2019s biographers there is little mention of the forgery case. Neither Zvi Elpeleg nor Philip Mattar\u2019s biographies of the Mufti discuss the forgery. Mattar mentions Arslan only once, even though he was one of the Mufti\u2019s key mentors and political partners.[CITATION-43] Cleveland states that at issue was Arslan\u2019s reputation as an anti-imperialist.[CITATION-44] Palestinian opposition leaders were using his Italian connections to embarrass the Mufti, but somehow Arslan was more compromised by the episode. Arslan\u2019s colleague at the Egyptian branch of the Syro-Palestinian Congress, and the Mufti\u2019s other mentor, Rashid Rida, warned Arslan \u2018that he was carrying his self-defence to extremes\u2019. Arslan denied being an Italian propagandist, and insisted that his rapprochement with Italy, and his condemnation of Ethiopia, resulted in better conditions for Muslims in Libya. He told Wauchope, \u2018I do not make any Italian, French, English, German, etc., propaganda. I only make Arab propaganda\u2019.[CITATION-45] Scholars tend to accept that the material was forged.[CITATION-46] The evidence about Husayni\u2019s connection with Italy had divided scholars until research in Italian archives proved the point. Massimiliano Fiore, in his study of Anglo-Italian relations in the Middle East, offers evidence of the direct support that Italy provided to the Mufti. The Italian propaganda officer in charge of this liaison went so far as to warn the Mufti in 1936 that future contact would have to take place outside Palestine, because Italian military intelligence (SIM) was under close observation by British security. Arslan was not the main conduit for Italian subversive funds to Palestine. Fiore takes no position on the question of forgery, although he emphasises that it did not matter\u2014most observers believed that its substance was true. Both Fiore and Nir Arielli demonstrate that Italy\u2019s support of Arslan was a: Arslan stopped criticising Italy in his publications in exchange for an easing of pressure on Muslims in Libya, to advance the pan-Arab cause\u2014and, of course, for money. According to Arielli, that money had been misappropriated by Arslan\u2019s partners\u2014either Ihsan Jabiri, or the Italian Consul in Jerusalem, Mariano de Angelis. Italian foreign policy \u2018ascribed great importance to Arslan. Quite a few of the reports regarding his articles and activities were shown to Mussolini\u2019.[CITATION-47] Manuela Williams\u2019s research in Italian archives shows that around December 1934, Ihsan Jabiri, the Mufti and the Italian Consul, De Angelis, met to discuss propaganda. De Angelis reported that the Mufti had \u2018warmed to the idea of friendship and collaboration with the Fascist regime\u2019.[CITATION-48] British intelligence noticed Jabiri: the CID reported in February that the purpose of Jabiri\u2019s visit to Palestine was to \u2018meet Syrian and Palestinian leaders and communicate to them the results of negotiations with Italian diplomats\u2019.[CITATION-49] The case had an impact on high policy, as the letters were included among the evidence to the Peel Commission, which investigated the cause of the 1936 Palestinian revolt and in 1937 recommended partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. In other words, to British officials on the commission, the press war illustrated the danger of Italian anti-British propaganda, which, it said, was one cause of the revolt. This was overstating the case, even if it was Britain\u2019s perception. Italy\u2019s easy ability to subvert British authority via Husayni\u2014who had normally been friendly towards Britain\u2014was cited among a great many examples of why the Mandate was \u2018unworkable\u2019.[CITATION-50] Arslan gave his own account of what happened in a letter to Wauchope written in June 1935. His arguments about the forgery are convincing. Yet, Arslan never addressed the nature of his relations with Italy. Arslan, who was normally blacklisted from travelling to the region, sought permission to enter Palestine so that he could bring a lawsuit.[CITATION-51] He stated his case to Wauchope, asking the High Commissioner to discipline his police and intelligence officers, who, he alleged, supported the forgery. After stating that he did not want to get into the details, Arslan provided numerous examples to support his argument that the letter was forged. He normally opened his letters with a long and elaborate series of customary compliments and praises to his friends, whereas the forgery opened with \u2018Dear Brother, His Eminence the honourable Sir Amin al-Husayni\u2019\u2014far shorter and less complimentary than usual. It also did not refer to Husayni as the Mufti, or Hajj.Arslan also argued that it would be absurd for him to write to Hajj Amin; that is, without any code, \u2018on such an important matter\u2019. This, he argued would be \u2018suicide\u2019, as it would invite further scrutiny, or even personal danger, from his and Italy\u2019s enemies. He added that it would make more sense to use allegory or allusion. Above all, a leader with his long experience of resisting imperialism would not make such an amateurish mistake.[CITATION-52] Moreover, he argued, there was no reason for him to spell out Italian financial support for Husayni in writing. The forged letter stated: \u2018I don\u2019t know if brother Ihsan Bek el Jabiri has told you of what has been arranged between me and between the Statesmen in Rome concerning our talk in Mecca and our agreement in Jerusalem\u2019.[CITATION-53] Since arriving in Palestine in February 1935, Jabiri had had plenty of opportunities to communicate with Husayni verbally and via intermediaries, and it would not have made sense for Arslan to risk writing about Jabiri\u2019s role.Additionally, Arslan argued, there were logical and chronological inconsistencies. He said that his passport would prove his last meeting with Mussolini was in February 1934, and then from April he spent five months with Husayni in Saudi Arabia at the Saudi\u2013Yemen peace conference. \u2018Why should I write to him about the so-called entente between Mussolini and myself while I had 1000 occasions to tell him all these things orally?\u2019[CITATION-54] Arslan\u2019s final argument was that the forgery contained four or five grammatical and linguistic mistakes: \u2018A member of the academy like me who is known by the purity of his writing and the solidity of his grammar cannot commit mistakes which are made by young students\u2019.[CITATION-55] Such mistakes were not obvious to me, although the formality of his writing style stands out in contrast to the simpler prose and casual word choices and style in the forgery.Arslan\u2019s letter to Wauchope attacked the theory of the crime, alleging he had no motive to send this letter. He attacked the means, highlighting the irrationality of sending such an incriminating letter, phrased so bluntly, without any code or security, and in such uncharacteristically poor style. His appeal is convincing, but does not prove the case. Arslan\u2019s arguments helpfully frame the forensic aspect of this analysis. Looking at samples from before and after this case alongside the 1935 letter, it will become clear to the naked eye that the 1935 letter was not written by the same hand.Aged 66 by 1935, Arslan suffered from an ailment that caused his hands to tremble. He once referred to it as his \u2018tired hands\u2019.[CITATION-56] He discussed the same condition in 1944 with Husayni, when explaining a change in handwriting in one of his letters. His letters were normally dictated to an aide. The American intelligence officer who indexed Hajj Amin\u2019s archive noted that Arslan\u2019s comment proved this was a genuine sample of his handwriting, perhaps as a point of reference for other investigations.[CITATION-57] A simple comparison of the three writing samples inshows that the 1935 letter lacks the tremor clearly visible in 1929 and 1944. The tremor is clearly visible in in the long-stroke lettersand(\u0627 and \u0644). Moreover, his aide\u2019s handwriting in a letter written the same month as the forgery is clearly different from that which is visible in the forgery.Handwriting SamplesHandwriting SamplesThere are plausible alternative explanations for the discrepancies. After Arslan\u2019s handwriting expert proved the letter was not in Arslan\u2019s hand, the editors ofandwho knew that Arslan dictated his letters to an aide, suggested that was the explanation. Al-Faruqi reacted more cautiously, stating that he was open to retraction if the letter was proved not to be authentic.[CITATION-58] Further writing samples of both Arslan and his aide can be found in a published collection of his correspondence with the Moroccan nationalist leader Muhammad Dawwud.[CITATION-59] In one such letter, discussed below, Arslan mentioned that the information it contained was so secret that he did not use his aide and instead wrote it without help; it cost him five hours of effort which had \u2018tired his eyes\u2019.[CITATION-60] When comparing the 1935 forgery with a handwriting sample from Arslan\u2019s aide during the same period, two clear differences appear: the samples slope in opposite directions, indicating opposite hand-dominance in writing (it would seem that the forger was left-handed). Also, the forger used two points to indicate the letters(\u064a) and(\u062a) while Arslan\u2019s aide used a single stroke.Arslan was denied the opportunity to present his case in court. However, the range of handwriting samples analysed above clearly establishes that the letter was forged, as Arslan contended.Zionist and British intelligence reports, when examined forensically alongside Arslan\u2019s letters, help to complete the picture of what happened. The evidence which follows will show that, although it was forged, the substance of the letter was based on fact. In February 1935, when he arrived in Palestine on behalf of the Syro-Palestinian Congress, Jabiri took measures to obscure his activity and spread false reports to cover his tracks. He spread false reports that he could not continue working with Shakib Arslan because of what the Arab nation would think of him and about his friendly position towards Italy. A Jewish Agency informant said: \u2018They say that Ihsan works for Germany\u2019s benefit. He has in his possession a large sum to disseminate Nazi ideology among Arabs of the east in general, and Palestine in particular\u2019.[CITATION-61] The Nazis had showed little interest in Arab aspirations thus far, although German consular records indicate that the Foreign Ministry was starting to pay attention to Palestine.[CITATION-62] Zionist intelligence had another well-placed source who knew the truth: the source, codenamed \u2018, whose biography will be discussed below, commented on false reports about Jabiri\u2019s ill health and desire to stay near the springs of Tiberias and Hamma, saying that Jabiri was healthy and chose to live in Tiberias because of its proximity to the Syrian border and its distance from British authorities.[CITATION-63] Other intelligence produced by the Jewish Agency\u2019s political department was more reliable. Eliyahu Epstein (Eilat) reported that the Mufti and Jabiri \u2018were supposed to have a long meeting with the Italian consul in Jerusalem and spoke about questions which remain concealed [to the source]. It is known only that as a result of the meeting, material was sent to Syria just before departure of the Syrian-Iraqi [pan-Arab party] delegation to Hejaz [for Hajj]\u2019.[CITATION-64] This aligns closely with Manuela Williams\u2019s findings, and suggests that De Angelis was indeed soliciting Husayni\u2019s partnership by the end of 1934.[CITATION-65] Although Arslan and Jabiri were deeply involved with the Italians, it seems that Husayni had not yet decided. It is possible that the forgery and press war forced his hand.The appendices of a CID report presented to the 1937 Peel Commission contain translations of the letter dated 20 February, as well as another dated 22 March, among other materials. The CID report discussed the 1935 press war, but signalled ignorance about the provenance of the first letter. \u2018The most reasonable theory is that, if the letter is not genuine, it is a compilation embodying the contents of a number of genuine letters between the leaders concerned\u2019. Indeed, as the appended CID report related:Ihsan Jabiri is reported also to have insisted in his conversations on the inauthenticity of this document. He, however, could not deny privately that the Palestine-Syrian delegation [Arslan] arrived at an agreement with Italy two years ago in regard to its policy in Tripolitania and the granting of self-rule to the Moslems there \u2026 The Syria-Palestine delegation, on the other hand, undertook to cease its hostile campaign against alleged Italian atrocities.[CITATION-66] The CID named Jabiri\u2019s co-conspirators, but not the Mufti. None the less, it agreed that the Nashashibis' Defence Party probably used the letter, forged or not, to attack Husayni\u2019s reputation.In August 1935, Arthur Wauchope forwarded to the Colonial Office another intelligence report that he had ordered about Italian propaganda. The report stated that:Early in 1934 reports began to be received from reliable intelligence sources to the effect that secret negotiations were proceeding between members of the Palestine-Syria delegation in Europe, with the cognisance and assistance of Haj Amin Husseini and possibly one or two other Istiqlal leaders (other than the Palestine Istiqlalists) and between a foreign (European) power.[CITATION-67] This was an oblique admission that British intelligence knew about the Mufti\u2019s role in promoting Italian propaganda.Arslan\u2019s views on the origins of the controversy align very closely with these accounts. In his appeal to Wauchope to allow him to enter Palestine, Arslan blamed British intelligence:The forged letter \u2026 had been submitted to certain Government Intelligence Officers in Palestine and ... while certain Government officers have advised against its publication some other officers have taken a favourable attitude regarding this act of forgery. This shows that the forgers of the letter have been encouraged by certain quarters and that it is not only the Jewish money which has interfered with this affair.[CITATION-68] Arslan\u2019s reference to \u2018Jewish money\u2019 seems antisemitic. Perhaps it was, although he was probably referring to the Jewish Agency\u2019s bribery of Defence Party politicians and their agents during their campaign to smear the Mufti, their common enemy. Zionist intelligence records contain no evidence of a direct hand in the forgery. Although the links to this case are unclear, they did regularly bribe opposition politicians and occasionally made their funds available to British contacts such as Domvile.[CITATION-69] Arslan believed that his enemies were working together to attack him. He was right, although their main target was Husayni. In 1944, Arslan told Husayni about several attempts from around the time of the forgery when new correspondents wrote to him, including the calligrapher \u2018Abd al-Qadir al-Shehabi and Shaykh Sulayman al-Taji al-Faruqi himself, evidently hoping to get samples of his handwriting in reply. Faruqi, he alleged, even invited him to editwhile he went on Hajj in 1935. \u2018So I answered him: How can I manage the newspaper when I am Geneva and it is published in Jaffa? So, I realised that he wished to receive written texts from me to use to satisfy the Jews and receive payment from them. I found out after that he did not travel for pilgrimage\u2019.[CITATION-70] This account is plausible, although it was recorded nine years after the event.Later in 1935, Arslan told Muhammed Dawwud about intelligence he had received from Kamal Hanun. Then a Palestinian student in Europe, Hanun later became a member of an all-party body leading Palestinian resistance after the Second World War.[CITATION-71] Hoping to ease Arslan\u2019s fear that everyone in Palestine believed the forgeries were real, Hanun told him that \u2018he had himself heard one of the falsifiers of the letter in Jerusalem telling how and where exactly they had forged the letter\u2019.[CITATION-72] Arslan\u2019s grasp of the case improved thanks to Palestinian intelligence gathering.Arslan privately attributed the origin of the Palestinian press war to the exiled Syrian opposition leader \u2018Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar, then living in Cairo. Arslan thought that Shahbandar, his rival, was trying to embarrass him and thereby curb his influence over the pan-Arab movement. Arslan could only link Shahbandar to the forgery indirectly, \u2018because it was made by Fakhri Nashashibi, and it was made with the agreement of Domvile, head of English intelligence in Jerusalem, and he is the strongest of Shahbandar\u2019s friends\u2019.[CITATION-73] It is remarkable that Arslan could name Domvile specifically. Although his role in military intelligence was a poorly kept secret, Britain\u2019s hand in this affair was hidden. After all, it was widely believed that the Defence Party and Zionist intelligence had orchestrated the forgery. Arslan\u2019s knowledge of Domvile\u2019s role was an achievement which indicates that pan-Arab and Palestinian parties wielded a competent counter-intelligence capability. On the other hand, Arslan\u2019s account of this affair to Husayni in 1944 reveals that he never correctly identified the person who intercepted his letter. He accused his friend Hajj Nimer al-Nabulsi of the Defence Party of forging his handwriting. When Arslan sent an intermediary to reprimand him, Nabulsi replied that he still loved Arslan, and the forgery was out of hatred for Hajj Amin. He later published in support of Arslan in[CITATION-74] When we consider Arslan\u2019s private correspondence in the light of his appeal to Wauchope, we understand that his arguments were based on specific knowledge of how his letters were intercepted, and Domvile\u2019s role in encouraging the forgery.Arslan could see that the forgery was based on his own correspondence. He also had personal experience with censorship, propaganda and intelligence, and was right to anticipate this interference. French authorities had aggressively sought to suppress his propaganda work since the end of the First World War.[CITATION-75] He discussed this fact with Dawwud and named it as one of many reasons he did not trust the British or Shahbandar. He failed to mention, of course, that he worked during that war as a pro-German and pro-Ottoman propagandist. He worked closely with their intelligence services and understood how intelligence officers could interfere with newspapers to affect public opinion.Despite Hanun\u2019s efforts to encourage him, Arslan told Dawwud that he felt defeated by the whole affair. He hoped that his lawsuit would clear his name, but he was denied entry to Palestine and was unable to find remote representation. Arslan suspected that the British government was protecting the forgers, telling Dawwud \u2018Overall their scheme would have backfired had not the English saved them from the power of the law\u2019. He was willing to forgive his fellow pan-Islamist Shaykh Sulayman, who had apologised for his involvement. Arslan concluded that Faruqi had been fooled, and so fooled others.[CITATION-76] He was probably right about all of it, although the scheme did in fact backfire on its authors.Arslan was disappointed that more colleagues\u2014especially Istiqlalists\u2014did not openly support him, even when it was clear that they had been taken in, writing:Simply enough, they have among them great lawyers thought to be trustworthy, honest and contentious, who would know the truth, but they are silenced by those who rejoice in envying me and hating Amin al-Husayni. Among these silencers there are unhappy people, they are disloyal cowards.[CITATION-77] Arslan fumed, saying \u2018Christian papers like Falastin, Karmil, and others like them, are enemies to each\u2019. Even worse, they anddid not answer his rebuttal letters. Arslan specifically named the al-Shanti brothers for their slander, and for their work as land brokers for the Zionists.[CITATION-78] This was the beginning of a long and deadly grudge Arslan would share with Husayni.Arslan discussed the case with Husayni in a letter in 1944. The American intelligence officer who indexed Husayni\u2019s archive noted that, although it was possible Arslan was lying to the Mufti throughout, he believed Arslan was telling the truth about the 1935 letter.[CITATION-79] Arslan praised Musa \u2018Alami for helping to discover the forgery, and lambasted the opposition journalists who had slandered him, expressing regret that the newspapers and journalists survived. He also expressed glee at a rumour that two of the al-Shanti sons had been assassinated, and asked Husayni if this was correct:If it is, then it is the greatest of jihadi deeds because this forgery was intended by those wicked people to serve the Jews and the loss of the Arab nations by it. Falastin newspaper has become offensive for us as it is also an expert in fake news.[CITATION-80] Arslan credited Husayni with the assassinations, saying: \u2018In the end, may God help you against [Palestinian] compatriots who are now worse than the Jews. The ones who have washed away such scandals are the Palestinian fighters that you raised\u2019. By this he meant Husayni\u2019s assassins. \u2018However, the consequences as for the slander, violence, injustice, and forgery are great on those who do it\u2019. Arslan took great comfort knowing that he had outlived many of his opponents, including Shahbandar, Fakhri Nashashibi and others. \u2018There is no gloating in death and I will die like them, but God gave me a longer life and made me witness the death of those who transgressed me, and for those who won after injustice, they have no path\u2019.[CITATION-81] It is clear from these various expressions how deeply personal the forgery was to Arslan. While we have fewer direct comments from Husayni, it should be clear that Husayni took these offences at least as seriously as Arslan, if not necessarily personally.With a listening station in Sarafand, Palestine, Britain\u2019s Government Code & Cipher School (GC&CS, today GCHQ) intercepted, decrypted and translated a large volume of communication traffic. Among the first clues the British uncovered about Italian propaganda in Palestine was a decrypted cable sent on 21 May 1934 from De Angelis, the Italian Consul in Jerusalem, to the Foreign Ministry in Rome. De Angelis requested authorisation \u2018for secret payments to Palestinian Arab Press\u2019, as discussed in an April memorandum. That memorandum does not appear in GC&CS\u2019s diplomatic series (HW 12) at the National Archives, although not all intercepts were included in the bound records, and some were probably destroyed. For example, from 13 March to 30 June 1934, GC&CS intercepted 2,087 Italian messages. Yet only a few hundred were published in the bound series.[CITATION-82] GC&CS, the Foreign Office and SIS were all aware by 1935 that Italian propaganda in Palestine would require further attention. Arslan rarely used commercial cable and wireless because it was expensive and insecure.Arslan and Husayni corresponded during and around the time of the interception and forgery of Arslan\u2019s letter, but not about Italy.[CITATION-83] The forgery was not based on regular mail correspondence, but rather on a hand-delivered letter from Egypt. Pan-Arab nationalists had gathered in Egypt to make introductions and co-ordinate their anti-colonial campaign activity before departing for the Hajj pilgrimage. The exact mode of interception is not certain, but there are a number of likely possibilities.For security, Arslan communicated through a trusted courier. Although there are other possible candidates, the most likely is Amanullah Khan, the ex-King of Afghanistan, who was deposed after a revolt in 1929. Amanullah had recently met with Arslan, and like him, had also accepted an Italian subsidy for his anti-British propaganda activity. The British Embassy in Rome reported these details to the Foreign Office. Although Amanullah would have attracted British attention anyway, reports of his ties to Mussolini and Arslan invited close surveillance by SIS, Egyptian police and GC&CS during Amanullah\u2019s stay in Egypt on the way to Mecca.[CITATION-84] A Zionist intelligence source close to Jamal al-Husayni reported that, during the pilgrimage, the Mufti\u2019s delegate, Taher al-Fityani, invited Amanullah to Palestine. Hajj Amin hoped the exiled king might lead pro-Palestine propaganda in Europe.[CITATION-85] The CID reported that Fityani\u2019s main aim in Mecca was to counter Nashashibi propaganda activities. Ragheb and Shaykh Sulayman al-Taji al-Faruqi headed a Palestinian delegation which travelled to Hejaz via Egypt to launch an anti-British agitation campaign. To counter them, and to retaliate for a January editorial which first accused Arslan of being an Italian agent, the Mufti publicly slandered Faruqi, alleging, curiously, thatintended to spread Italian propaganda. Ragheb went to Cairo and Mecca without Faruqi. Frustrated and embarrassed, Faruqi sought to defend himself against the accusation of working for the Italians. Some British authorities were keen to support him. The CID saw his accusations against Arslan as corroborating evidence that Arslan and Jabiri were Italian agents. Arslan and his supporters argued that this was French disinformation.[CITATION-86] In fact, Faruqi planned to use his abortive trip to win over youth support for the opposition parties by spreading anti-Jewish propaganda, alleging their designs to take over al-Aqsa.[CITATION-87] The Mufti\u2019s accusations frustrated those plans.Taher al-Fityani was co-editor ofwith Hajj Amin\u2019s cousin, Munif al-Husayni. During the Cairo meetings, Arslan\u2019s letter reached Taher al-Fityani, who then forwarded the materials to Munif in Jerusalem. There, a spy managed to read the materials and reported the gist to the Nashashibis, the Zionists and the British.The spy\u2019s name was \u2018Abd al-Qadir Rashid. He was from Hebron, from the Muhtasib family. He married a Jewish woman, Mazal, with whom he had children and then moved to Jerusalem.[CITATION-88] He inherited the occupational name Qawwas, or bowman, from his father. The designation was used by the Ottomans for guards of the consulates in Jerusalem. Rashid was a journalist and worked for several nationalist newspapers during his career. His father was a friend of one of the founders of Zionist intelligence, Haim Margalit Kalvarisky, who paid him well for information.[CITATION-89] In 1929, Rashid testified as a journalist and translator to the Shaw Commission about Jewish art which was published in the newspaper he worked for which, he argued, indicated Zionist plans to take over the Muslim holy site of the Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem.[CITATION-90] Shortly afterwards, it would appear, he began to inform on the Husaynis, their newspapers and the national institutions to the Jewish Agency. He worked for, the SMC and for Jamal al-Husayni at the Palestinian Arab Executive. Therefore, he was one of the Zionists\u2019 best-placed sources. Moreover, journalists had excellent access and could travel relatively freely. The market for secret intelligence was lucrative, and journalists could sell the same secret to multiple buyers. Under several codenames (sometimes, for \u2018Ovadiya\u2014a cognate of \u2018Abd al-Qadir; sometimes, another Hebraisation of his given name; and possibly also \u2018R\u2019), Rashid regularly reported to his Zionist handlers\u2014Aharon Haim Cohen and Eliyahu Sasson. Both were officers of the Arab Bureau of the Jewish Agency\u2019s political department. For a time, in the early 1930s, they may have suspected Rashid of acting as a double agent. They thought he embellished otherwise open-source news in many of his secret reports. By 1935, they apparently trusted him.[CITATION-91] In October 1934, Rashid began to report on Shakib Arslan\u2019s Palestinian connections to his pro-Italian scheme.[CITATION-92] Sasson and Cohen regularly met with Rashid and recorded his information in typed reports later. Thus, the dates of the reports are usually unhelpful in establishing a chronology. However, these reports prove that it was Rashid who saw Arslan\u2019s genuine letters in the first place. In February, Rashid reported to Sasson that Ragheb Nashashibi travelled to Egypt for propaganda purposes. He elaborated:They say that he [Ragheb] will meet the heads of the Egyptian Wafd and the Muslim state delegations in Cairo, and he will discuss with them the injustice caused to Arabs by the Mandate policy. A second source says that he went to disrupt Taher al-Fityani, who has been doing this [meeting Muslim state delegations] for a few days in Cairo.[CITATION-93] Fityani was acting as the Mufti\u2019s emissary to Cairo and to the Hajj in Mecca. He wrote to Munif al-Husayni, detailing his meetings with other nationalist leaders to collect letters of introduction for presentation to the Saudis during Hajj.[CITATION-94] On 22 March, a few days after the end of Hajj, the delegations were returning home. \u2018R\u2019 reported to Aharon Haim Cohen about the meetings that took place in Egypt. Cohen relayed:Shakib Arslan wrote to Hajj Amin that he should help the Italian plan since they are prepared to hand him [Arslan] their whole propaganda system in the east. Hajj Amin agreed. In the same letter Shakib indicates that Ihsan Jabiri serves as his agent in Palestine and that Hajj Amin should trust him and have faith in his words and deeds.[CITATION-95] This is the main substance of the forged letter of 20 February and serves as proof that Rashid had seen the letter, but did not copy it. Since Rashid was able to record Hajj Amin\u2019s response, it also indicates that he did this in Jerusalem, while the letter was in his editor\u2019s possession. It is also noteworthy that this all took place on or before 22 March. This is the date of the second letter purported to be from Arslan to the Mufti, which was published in the opposition press.[CITATION-96] It would seem that Rashid also reported to a British client. British authorities had been aware of the Mufti\u2019s Italian connections long before they were published in the forged Arslan letter. Robert Allason Furness was appointed Public Information Officer to Palestine in 1934, and he began work to set up government broadcasting in Arabic; in 1938, he helped to establish the BBC World Service\u2019s first foreign-language station in Arabic. He was, essentially, the top propaganda and censorship authority in Palestine, and had previously fulfilled the same role in Cairo. The Palestine Government forwarded to the Foreign Office a report by Furness dated 18 March 1935, covering Arslan\u2019s propaganda activity. Furness believed that Arslan\u2019sdirectly influenced\u2019s new pro-Italian stance:The day before yesterday I ran across an Arab acquaintance who told me that he had seen in possession of the editor of \u2018al-Difa\u2018a\u2019 [Ibrahim al-Shanti] (who is a friend of his) a letter to Munif Husseini, editor of \u2018Al Jami\u2019a al Arabiya\u2019, from the Italian Consul-General, referring to the above article in \u2018La Nation Arabe\u2019 and suggesting the lines on which a similar article might be written in the \u2018Jami\u2019a al Arabiya\u2019, and that this article, having been published, should be sent to the Arab Propaganda Bureau in Rome.He also informed me that a friend of his had read a letter from Shakib Arslan to the Mufti inviting him to get in touch with the above Arab Propaganda Bureau, as to which Ihsan Jabiri would supply all necessary information.\u2026He said he had advised the editor of \u2018Al Difa\u2018a\u2019 to show me the letter to Munif Eff. which had, to put it politely, come into his possession, but I do not suppose Ibrahim Eff. Shanti will do this.[CITATION-97] Furness\u2019s friend was probably Fakhri al-Nashashibi. If Arslan\u2019s account was correct, Fakhri would have solicited the forgery from Nimer al-Nabulsi, based on \u2018Abd al-Qadir Rashid\u2019s intelligence. After monitoring Italian propaganda for a year, Domvile and his intelligence colleagues finally had something they could use to expose Hajj Amin without blowing their top-secret sources. Furness\u2019s connection is further proved by the fact that, widely seen as Britain\u2019s mouthpiece, was the first to break the story on 17 April. That article stated that their correspondent in Jaffa had reported the substance by telephone.[CITATION-98] In 1943, US intelligence gathered information on the 1935 press war as part of its wartime intelligence sharing with Britain. Responding to an American request for documents, the Inter-Service Liaison Department (ISLD), the branch of SIS which handled intelligence sharing with other services, presented concluding notes to a CID report on the topic. It highlighted Arslan\u2019s insistence in a letter to the High Commissioner that the letter was forged. It also highlighted thatandwere both critical of Arslan\u2019s Italian policy during March 1935, before the publication of the forgery. Perhaps ISLD meant to imply a motive. It said explicitly that opportunists accused the Mufti and his party of being in the pay of the Italians.[CITATION-99] The staff at SIS in Palestine had grown considerably between 1935 and 1943. The people in charge at the start, such as Domvile, had been promoted to senior regional roles. Moreover, Fakhri al-Nashashibi was assassinated by one of the Mufti\u2019s gunmen in Baghdad in late 1941.[CITATION-100] Perhaps SIS lacked a paper record of the incident, or the will to query those who might remember. Even if they did, SIS was not likely to disclose Domvile\u2019s blunder. SIS offered no clear answer to the Americans about the forgery.The same American file contains the testimony of Harith al-Taji al-Faruqi, the son of Shaykh Sulayman. Harith quit his studies in Cambridge in February 1940 and travelled to Italy for a cycling trip. Bad timing led him to spend most of the war interned as an enemy alien in Libya, although he escaped to Rome during mid-1943. OSS authorities did not believe much of his story and sensed he was hiding his true relations with pan-Arab and Libyan nationalist contacts. Harith was captured in Italy in 1944 by the US army and was processed for repatriation to Palestine. His testimony discussed the press war. His interrogators asked about his political connections, and of course, the Mufti. On the latter, he mentioned that his father, as a leader of the opposition faction, published documents, which were brought to him by the heads of the Nashashibi family: \u2018Two days after, all the documents appeared on the front of our paper\u2019.[CITATION-101] Harith\u2019s testimony provides some important evidence. He knew that there were multiple documents. He did not mention the forgery. Finally, he noted a two-day turnover from receipt to publication. If this evidence is to be believed, then it demonstrates ASI\u2019s involvement in the forgery. ASI stated on 4 April, two weeks before publication of the forgery, that \u2018data in possession of Air Staff intelligence proves that Haj Amin knows all about the Mussolini-Arslan meeting\u2019.[CITATION-102] It also shows that Shaykh Sulayman probably did not know that the letters were forged when he received them.At some point between 22 March and 4 April 1935, Fakhri approached Pat Domvile with their intelligence\u2014courtesy of \u2018Abd al-Qadir Rashid\u2014detailing the Mufti\u2019s role in supporting Italian propaganda. Rashid probably saw the letters in Jerusalem while they were in Munif\u2019s possession. He then reported to his Palestinian, Zionist and British clients. Fakhri Nashashibi\u2019s comrade, Nimer al-Nabulsi, then created the forgery. Domvile, Zionist intelligence and Nashashibi\u2019s party all wanted to attack the Mufti and so they smeared him in the press. The British mainly wanted to expose the Italian Consul. So, with their encouragement, Nashashibi passed his information to different journalists, and to Furness. Whereas Ibrahim al-Shanti exercised caution, refusing to bring the material to the British authorities, Faruqi was keen to get back at Hajj Amin for slandering him and, believing the letter was genuine, published it.The scandal forced pro- and anti-Husayni factions to retrench during spring and summer 1935. The episode reinforced a lasting but false impression that Palestinian politics were organised around a timeless and petty clan feud. British and Zionist observers favoured a factional interpretation because it minimised Palestinian national ambitions and justified Britain\u2019s reluctance to introduce democratic institutions. A Nashashibi\u2013Husayni feud existed before the scandal, but it was not a core schism in Palestinian nationalist politics. If anything, by 1935, opinion diverged around the alignment of the national movement with any foreign power, be it Italy or Britain. The forgery and press war temporarily transformed this debate by focusing attention on the Mufti and forcing all parties, newspapers and individuals to adopt a pro- or anti-Husayni stance. Those who believed the opposition\u2019s version, that Arslan\u2019s letter was genuine, and condemned Italian imperial policy, also supported their call for Hajj Amin to resign his influential posts. On the other hand, many Palestinians were more moved by the possibility that Husayni was acting against Britain than by their dislike of Italy. Even to those who supported Arslan and Husayni, believed that the letter was a forgery and defended Italian ambitions over British and French interests, this amounted to a defence of Arslan, Husayni and the National Pact. Under these conditions, Husayni could not remain on the fence. Indeed, the scandal probably forced him off it.After the publication of the forged letter in, the CID observed the way the scandal fractured Palestinian parties and put Husayni\u2019s new party on the defensive: \u2018This fell like a thunderbolt on the Mufti faction who strenuously denied it, claiming that it was forged. They solicited and received telegrams and statements of support to Haj Amin from various parts of the country and elsewhere\u2019. As he often did in these situations, Hajj Amin bolstered his personal security. The CID then remarked on the question of forgery, saying that opinion was \u2018divided\u2019. \u2018Whether this letter was forged or not, the subject matter dealt with in regard to Italian propaganda is corroborated by intelligence reports received during the past year or so and by propaganda articles [by Arslan] in favour of Italy and against Abyssinia\u2019.[CITATION-103] The British accomplished their goal of exposing De Angelis, but would fail to curb Italian propaganda. Faruqi would eventually apologise and admit that the letter was forged. His newspaper soon supported Italian propaganda too.The plot to embarrass the Mufti backfired in several ways. It did not harm the Mufti\u2019s influence, and in fact proved he was immune to scandals of this kind, so long as he was seen to be serving the national interest. The exposure did not curb Italian propaganda activity, which continued to grow and to subsidise opposition newspapers, as well as key leaders in Istiqlal and the youth parties. The most significant consequence was a permanent fracture in the Palestinian and pan-Arab causes: a deadly grudge emerged between Husayni and Arslan on the one side and their opponents on the other.The Palestine government\u2019s report on Italian propaganda, probably authored by CID, clearly blamed the Nashashibis and their party for the scandal. It offered no comment on whether the letter was indeed forged. It over-optimistically reported that the affair \u2018impeded\u2019 Italian efforts, sinceceased publishing any more pro-Italian material, and other papers includingwere averse to making favourable references to Italy. Even Fakhri Nashashibi, who had pondered helping Italy to recruit labourers for Eritrea, declined to employ Italian contractors for fear of partisan attack.[CITATION-104] Other elements of the Italian propaganda campaign continued unabated, however. Most significant among them were the broadcasts from Radio Bari, which were increasingly hostile towards Britain and since April 1935 had overtly supported the Husayni-led PAP manifesto. The CID argued that Italian propaganda activity continued, but largely in secret.[CITATION-105] The affair had significant consequences for Palestinian party politics. As early as May 1935, the scandal had pushed newspapers affiliated with the Istiqlal party\u2014the prize of this whole affair\u2014to cease anti-Husayni publications. Leading Istiqlalists began to mediate the crisis between the opposition newspapers and the Husayni faction. The Defence Party steadfastly supported the publishers and cut ties with Arslan\u2019s Syro-Palestinian congress. The Youth Congress, a leading youth party, maintained its support for Husayni throughout the scandal.[CITATION-106] Zionist intelligence reported in early May 1935 that Hajj Amin was seeking compromise with Faruqi and had sent mediators to ask him to cease his attacks. Faruqi insisted as a precondition that the Mufti admit Shakib Arslan\u2019s connection to Italy, and that pro-Husayni newspapers apologise for their slurs against him.[CITATION-107] That condition was refused. Another source, \u2018Rahman\u2019, reported that a special delegation was being sent from Jerusalem to Jaffa to negotiate with Shaykh Sulayman. It argued that the press war was damaging both sides. Faruqi promised to change his sharp position. Other opposition figures, including \u2018Isa al-\u2018Isa, telephoned Faruqi to see whether he would change his mind. Faruqi replied that he feared that he would be blamed for bringing chaos to Islam. As his position on thefaction and the Italians began to soften,, it was reported, had been accepting a German subsidy of \u00a3120 per month.[CITATION-108] Their case against Hajj Amin crumbled along with their integrity.In late July, the press scandal hinged on the question of Arslan\u2019s lawsuit. Sasson reported that his source attended a meeting with Faruqi. When asked about the rumour that Arslan was suing him, Faruqi replied, \u2018hopefully\u2019, and changed subjects. Ragheb Nashashibi, Sasson reported, was privately responsible for the results of the ruling that denied Arslan entry to Palestine. Faruqi planned to bring his own handwriting experts, should the suit come to trial. He also planned to publish a second letter.[CITATION-109] Amid the confusion, Istiqlalists began to give up on Faruqi andEfforts to mend fences flagged.The CID reported in August 1935 that peace efforts had been \u2018abortive\u2019. The Nashashibis wanted the Mufti to keep out of national politics. Obviously, he would not agree to this condition. Jamal was even more hostile, wishing to continue his activity against the opposition and deny them respite through agreement or co-operation.[CITATION-110] Oversimplifying matters, ASI argued that factionalism in newspapers was evidence that the party system was organised for the personal benefit of its leaders rather than national interest. This view suited Domvile\u2019s dismissive attitude towards Palestinians, especially since the parties were, in fact, largely united around opposition to Zionism. Perhaps the forgery case reinforced the narrative of factional elites for British and Zionist observers simply because they had failed in their basic aims to damage Husayni and Italian propaganda.The press war was more than a family feud. It was a major debate about the national interest. By late summer 1935, interest in the scandal was waning. ASI admitted that the public had been over-exposed to the scandal: \u2018As however the Press has written about little else for many months past it cannot be said that the political leaders were greatly embarrassed\u2019.[CITATION-111] The forgeries failed to break Italy\u2019s ties to Arslan or Husayni.The controversy brought little clarity to policy-makers. The imminent outbreak of hostilities in East Africa spurred renewed interest in Italian propaganda and the Palestinian press. Consequently, the government seriously examined the Mufti\u2019s true views. In response, ASI reported that Husayni and PAP were still pro-Italian and still receiving Italian funds.[CITATION-112] The situation was in fact worse, as the Italian consulate began to win over opposition newspapers too.The Colonial Office asked Wauchope about the Mufti after receiving Italian reports (almost certainly from signals intelligence), which indicated that PAP shared his \u2018substantial Italophile attitude\u2019. Wauchope or his Chief Secretary replied that most Palestinians were anti-Italian, so the Mufti could not openly be pro-Italian. Palestinians were mainly interested in the possibility of a European war, and sought the support of all pan-Arab parties and the independent Arab states as a united front to exploit the embarrassing moment of weakness for Britain and France. The Palestine government verified that Arslan and Jabiri were paid by Italy, and that the Mufti was close to them: \u2018Even without encouragement from outside, all Arab politicians in Palestine, and not the Mufti and his followers only, hope that the embarrassment of war would bring up a modification of the present policy in a sense more favourable to the Arabs\u2019. Yet Husayni\u2019s was not the only voice that mattered, and many Palestinians still favoured a friendly policy towards Britain. Wauchope concluded, \u2018the Mufti is not Italophile. He is however sitting on the fence and it is, of course, always possible that he might in certain circumstances be persuaded to make use of Italian money and of international complications to further Arab nationalist aims and his own ambitions\u2019.[CITATION-113] This was over-optimistic, and perhaps a sign of Wauchope\u2019s embarrassment.The Foreign Office came to an entirely different conclusion. Colonel Peake, commander of the Arab Legion in Transjordan, reported that Palestinians were becoming sympathetic to Italy, and that the Mufti and the Istiqlal party were receiving bribes.[CITATION-114] George Rendell, head of the Eastern Department, concluded: \u2018This is I think the first categorical statement we have had that the Italians have collared the Grand Mufti, and the whole of Istiqlal. It is a pity as the Mufti has a strong following\u2019.[CITATION-115] As Whitehall struggled to understand the evidence, Istiqlal party leaders began to reconcile with the Mufti. Partisan conflict dwindled, and the Nashashibi faction never recovered. The Mufti had won his prize. The Palestinian press consolidated around its anti-Zionist and anti-British positions following the discovery of large-scale arms smuggling by the Jewish militia,Arslan again published pro-Italian articles inHis renewed propaganda campaign now seemed to promote Arab independence in addition to a pro-Italian policy. In a speech to the youth parties, Jamal al-Husayni openly stated PAP\u2019s aim to fight \u2018the English and the Jews\u2019 and to mobilise the youth to lead the national movement.[CITATION-116] At this stage, the Mufti became less secretive about his pro-Italian alignment. According to Jewish Agency intelligence reports, the Mufti met pan-Arab party leaders in Syria to discuss several matters, including the possibility of a European war. The Mufti pressed his Syrian compatriots to restrain newspapers that attacked Italy, and indicated that two Damascene journalists had been bribed with Italian money. French authorities had been monitoring this activity and excluded Husayni from entering Damascus.[CITATION-117] Italy\u2019s propaganda campaign expanded to opposition papers. In February 1936, Wauchope sent the Colonial Office a follow-up report to his August report from the CID on Italian propaganda. Faruqi\u2019swas now receiving Italian funds. The CID reported that,andhad each ceased attacks on Italy. Onlymaintained a hostile attitude. Mohamed \u2018Ali al-Taher\u2014a friend of Arslan\u2014was one of the main conduits for the transfer of Italian funds to Palestinian newspapers. The CID concluded that Italian propaganda had not failed, and in fact had promoted anti-British agitation across all parties. The public was still apathetic towards Italy, but its campaign had won over four of the main parties and even more newspapers.[CITATION-118] The opposition\u2019s failure to make any substantial gains from its exposure of the Mufti\u2019s links to Italy hastened reconciliation between Istiqilal, the youth parties and PAP.By the time of the Palestinian revolt, that financial support for propaganda had turned into funds for rebels. In late 1936, Jabiri was reported to have distributed some \u00a357,000, including \u00a33,000 via Arslan, and another \u00a315,000 via the consulate. Jabiri and Arslan had apparently fallen out, as the latter accused the former and the Italian consul of misappropriating \u00a323,000.[CITATION-119] Moreover, with a new editor, Jalal al-\u2018Ouf,was now firmly pro-Italy and accepted Italian funds to publish anti-British material. The paper was printed in Italy and illicitly distributed in Palestine. Palestinian editors were not as much pro-Italian as they were anti-British. The General Staff Intelligence concluded, \u2018This is mainly due to the new policy adopted by the \u201cItalian Telegraphic News Agency\u201d of Damascus, Syria, which can be summed up as \u201cWhat is detrimental to Great Britain in the east is to the good of Italy\u201d\u2019. A Jewish source reported to RAF intelligence that Husayni was still receiving Italian funds via Shakib Arslan.[CITATION-120] Of course, the British had their own sources to verify this.The Jewish source may have been Maurice B. Hexter, an American social worker who was head of the Jewish Agency\u2019s colonisation department until 1938. He sent a poorly coded message to Moshe Shertok, head of the Jewish Agency\u2019s political department, before his departure from Palestine. The report contained detailed intelligence about the Mufti\u2019s connection to Italy. Hexter had recently dined with Harry Patrick Rice, the former CID chief:in the course of a long discussion [I] asked him whether he had ever received proof that [the Mufti] had received any money from [Italy]. At this he waxed rather indignant in his reminiscence. He said he had no doubt whatsoever, and had repeatedly written to [John Hawthorn Hall, the Chief Secretary] to this effect and to his amazement one day was summoned to [the Executive Council] and asked to give his proofs. He told them he had sent a secret agent to [Egypt], who had returned with complete proof, and even with [the secret code].[CITATION-121] Rice told Hall that the Italian Consul in Egypt had distributed funds to rebels. Asked for the name of his agent, Rice inexplicably agreed to tell Hexter on condition of secrecy. His agent, Fakhri Nashashibi, had gone to Egypt to gather documentary evidence on Italian finance for the Mufti, his offices and the revolt. The forgery affair failed to limit Italian activities in Palestine, or to embarrass the Mufti. It was one of many deeds for which Fakhri paid with his life, when the Mufti\u2019s assassins finally caught up with him.[CITATION-122] The forgery case proved that Husayni\u2019s reputation was resilient and made him a stronger leader. His focus on the national interest, and his shared concept of that interest with Palestinians, made him a national leader. The forgery helped to destroy the opposition news editors, who, within a short time, had either rescinded their criticisms or fled the country. Although the episode caused British and Zionist observers to emphasise Husayni\u2013Nashashibi factionalism in Palestinian politics, this has skewed the historical record. The press war was not only a debate about how to organise power in Palestine, but also about the extent to which Palestinians ought to side with Italy\u2014hostile to both Libyans and Britain\u2014in the pursuit of the national interest. It became apparent to all that Italian influence was far less controversial than Zionist colonisation and arms smuggling. Palestinians supported Italy as part of a broader strategy to exploit European tensions. Yet, by resorting to analyses about Palestinian factionalism, British observers could minimise the significance of the affair, especially as it established Husayni as a national leader and strengthened Italy\u2019s influence campaign in Palestine. Factionalism played its part, but this was not just about Husaynis and Nashashibis\u2014it was about the nascent instruments of state that were never allowed to fully develop.This case also illustrates that, although Palestinian and pan-Arab parties lacked security bureaucracies that mirrored their Zionist opponents, they gathered and used intelligence to great effect. Arslan understood who smeared him and why, and only lacked detail about the source of the leak. That information was deployed effectively in the press and behind the scenes. This depth of understanding far exceeds that described in British or Zionist intelligence reports on the same issues. British attempts to use this case to expose Italian influence over Husayni and Arslan backfired, and rather accelerated the rate at which Palestinian newspapers began to support Italian policy. For the Nashashibis and other opposition leaders, this was a last-ditch effort to damage Husayni\u2019s growing power and popularity. With Fakhri\u2019s ill-considered scheme in tatters, he led his family and his party even closer to the Zionists and the British. By 1938, they would be co-operating to crush the Palestinian revolt.[CITATION-123] "

    "text": "The shoe buckle of the eighteenth century is an alien object today. At the time, shoes were manufactured without fastenings and the buckle was purchased separately. This offered opportunities for decoration, particularly for men, whose shoes were otherwise plain and unchanging. Over the course of the century, buckles grew larger and more elaborate, reaching their apogee in the \u2018Artois\u2019 style of the 1780s. In the wake of the French Revolution, buckles came to be associated with effeminacy and the excesses of the aristocracy, so fell from fashion. This article explores the roles of gender and class in this story, and will challenge the usual association of the buckle with foppery, demonstrating that they were consistent with mainstream masculinities until the 1790s. In order to understand the shoe buckle\u2019s significance, the article engages with it as a material artefact. With their intricate mechanisms, complex processes of fastening, and roles in meaningful rituals, shoe buckles give us an insight into haptic practices and the embodiment of gender. The article therefore makes the case that shoe buckles were characteristic of masculinities, material practices and social identities in eighteenth-century Britain.The shoe buckle of the eighteenth century is an alien object in the twenty-first. We have no use for them today, because shoes come with fastenings; but in the eighteenth century they did not, and buckles had to be purchased separately. This offered an opportunity for decoration, especially for men: men\u2019s shoes were plain and unchanging in this period, and shoe historians often note that more interest lies in their buckles.[CITATION-1] Indeed, buckles could be fabulously decorative objects: they could be manufactured from precious metals such as silver or gold, feature intricate designs, and be adorned with shiny stones. Some were enormous. In Sheridan\u2019s comedy(1777), Lord Foppington explains that, formerly, \u2018the buckle was a sort of machine, intended to keep on the shoe; but now the case is quite reversed, and the shoe is of no earthly use, but to keep on the buckle\u2019.[CITATION-2] Shoe buckles were a characteristic feature of eighteenth-century dress and illustrate many facets of the period more generally. They were widely worn from the 1690s onwards\u2014forming part of the classic male patrician ensemble of buckled shoes, stockings, breeches and coat\u2014and fell from favour a century later. In the wake of the French Revolution, the shoe buckle came to be identified with the excesses of aristocratic fashion and, from the early 1790s, men shod themselves in boots or laced shoes instead, which apparently suited the sober and democratic mood of the day. This caused consternation among the buckle-makers, who had come to rely on this lucrative trade and suddenly faced penury. Deputations from London and the Midlands presented petitions to the court, imploring members of the royal family to continue wearing buckles and to require that they be worn in their presence. The Duke of Gloucester favoured the petitioners \u2018with assurances of his best wishes and support of a manufacture so manly and ornamental as buckles\u2019.[CITATION-3] The notion that buckles could be both manly and ornamental sits oddly with the current historiography. In general, buckles have been overlooked by historians of gender, which is curious given the attention accorded to comparable worn articles, such as wigs, hats and codpieces.[CITATION-4] Much of the work on buckles is curatorial or economic: they have not received a sustained treatment by cultural historians, who mention their significance in passing, if at all. Historians of jewellery note that articles like buckles tended to feature in moral debates about luxury and vanity.[CITATION-5] In literary studies too, buckles are analysed as a marker of class and gender, and a means to critique the pretensions of their wearers.[CITATION-6] They were a very conspicuous form of consumer good, at a time when there was unease about the fluidity of social distinctions and the corrupting effects of luxury. Men in particular were exhorted to resist this, in the interests of political liberty, manly independence, godly virtue and national strength.[CITATION-7] In these terms, buckles were ornamental, but not manly.The established story in fashion history is that the late eighteenth century witnessed a \u2018renunciation\u2019 in male fashion, as men\u2019s dress became increasingly plain and uniform. The psychoanalyst J.C. Fl\u00fcgel first made this case in the 1930s, arguing that the reversal of the usual gendering of bodily display entailed a dramatic reorganisation of masculinity.[CITATION-8] Subsequent historians, such as David Kuchta, have reinforced this picture, arguing that respectable men adopted plain colours and styles as they asserted their collective moral right to rule.[CITATION-9] This served to widen gender difference, since women were identified with their biology and thence the domestic sphere, whereas men\u2019s disembodiedness befitted the rational public sphere.[CITATION-10] At first sight, the decline of the buckle might appear to fit this chronology, but we will see that in many ways it actually serves to critique it: the notion of the \u2018great masculine renunciation\u2019 misreads the role of ornament in eighteenth-century costume and understates the showiness of the fashions that followed.Since these narratives maintain that display was problematic for men, historians have tended to associate buckles with foppery. Buckles feature prominently in studies of the \u2018macaronis\u2019, the fashion-obsessed men named after the pasta dish that they supposedly brought back from the Grand Tour\u2014along with other foreign styles and vices.[CITATION-11] The shoe historians Bernard and Therle Hughes deployed an extract from(1698), in which city beaus wear \u2018Shoes black as Jet, which shin\u2019d by much Rubbing \u2026 displayed Buckles preserv\u2019d bright in a Box of Cotton, that they dazzled the Eyes of each Beholder like a piece of Looking-Glass in the Sunshine\u2019.[CITATION-12] This passage has been re-quoted by subsequent shoe historians, since it conveniently reinforces the image of buckles as showy and excessive, but it is in fact a misquotation: the original passage instead refers to black boots (which did not have buckles) and shiny spurs.[CITATION-13] The focus on foppery has obscured the extent to which buckles featured in mainstream masculine wear, and indeed could be considered manly. This article therefore re-examines the relationship between men and their buckles. It begins by exploring the history of buckles, establishing that their meanings were complex and subject to change. It then considers buckles as material artefacts, and concludes by exploring their implications for masculinity. We will see how the shoe buckle complicates our current understanding of the relationship between masculinity, effeminacy and luxury consumer goods, and furthermore that it played a role in wider shifts in the nature of social identity.In order to do this, the article considers the shoe buckle as an object, as well as something that was discussed in contemporary texts. Historians of material culture argue that we should \u2018our research with objects\u2019, rather than use them to illustrate arguments derived from documentary evidence.[CITATION-14] Material sources have the potential to tell us what other sources cannot. In the case of buckles, it is vital to engage with their materiality in order to get a sense of their physical effect on those who used them, and its social and cultural impact. Buckles were practical items that should be considered as objects in use,[CITATION-15] rather than static visual artefacts. In museums today, buckles are commonly displayed separately from the shoe, or on a shoe in isolation from a body: this disembodied approach to objects gives little impression of their everyday use or their importance to their wearers. Historians of emotions have thought about the ways in which objects act upon people\u2019s feelings, highlighting the material and sensorial nature of pre-modern emotions.[CITATION-16] Buckles were small and valuable so were often given as gifts, and they could be cherished personal objects, replete with memories and emotional associations.In order to think about buckles as objects, I have studied buckles in five museum collections.[CITATION-17] I have handled around a hundred buckles, viewed many more, and also handled a few examples of buckled shoes. Many buckles survive in museums today, often the bequests of private collectors. In these collections, shoe buckles are commonly archived alongside other types of buckles, including those for neckstocks, breeches, spurs and hats.[CITATION-18] Buckles were often sold as a matching suite in an ornate leather-covered wooden case, which could well have been given as a present.[CITATION-19] Large numbers of shoe buckles survive because they were detachable, and could therefore be retained after the shoe wore out. Almost invariably, buckles and shoes have been preserved separately: among the thousands of shoes in the national shoe collection at Northampton Museum, only one men\u2019s shoe from the eighteenth century features its buckle. Most surviving shoes are buckleless, but it is sometimes possible to see punctures, indentations and rust marks in the leather where a buckle once belonged.[CITATION-20] It is likely that where shoes are displayed with buckles, they have been married up with a buckle from elsewhere.[CITATION-21] In a sense, however, this does not matter, as buckles were supposed to be interchangeable. Buckle collections are skewed in other ways, since it tends to be the fancy and valuable ones that were preserved: few of the cheap buckles worn by humble people survive, and those that do tend to be heavily decayed artefacts recovered by archaeologists or metal detectorists.[CITATION-22] Since buckle fashions changed so quickly, it was also common for owners to trade in their old ones, so far more buckles survive from the later eighteenth century, when their size and lavish decoration differed from earlier periods.[CITATION-23] There is much to be gained from physically engaging with a buckle, in comparison with studying a visual representation. Only by handling it do you get a sense of its physical heft and intricate construction. Crucially, this also allows you to inspect the reverse, since buckles in photographs or exhibitions are invariably displayed face-up: the underside of the buckle reveals inscriptions, makers\u2019 marks (and sometimes hallmarks) and the complex fastening mechanism. Only by manipulating this mechanism do you understand the skill required to fix a buckle in place: as with tying a shoelace, this would have become second nature with repetition, but would have taken some time to learn. The shoe buckle therefore gives us an insight into a lost haptic practice that was regularly performed by a large proportion of the population in eighteenth-century Britain.The origin of the shoe buckle was a matter of some debate in the Georgian period.[CITATION-24] Buckles had been used as fasteners on shoes since medieval times, when they were sewn in (as on a modern shoe), but the practice of using a detachable buckle dates from the Restoration. Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary on 22 January 1660: \u2018This day I began to put on buckles to my shoes\u2019.[CITATION-25] At that time they were a feature of court dress, but they were more widely adopted from the 1680s, when buckled shoes were worn as part of the male ensemble of coat, waistcoat, breeches and stockings. The buckle was then manufactured in what would become its standard form, with a decorative rim and a separate iron bar to hold the moving parts in place. Buckles were initially fairly small\u2014hence the later comment that the period was \u2018remarkable for the introduction of William [III], liberty, and the minute shoe-buckle\u2019.[CITATION-26] Shoes in this period had narrow straps but, as shoes became heavier with broader straps, the size of the buckle grew. The construction of shoes in the eighteenth century lent itself to the detachable buckle, since shoes were constructed symmetrically on a straight last with two long straps.From the beginning, buckles were interchangeable and decorative. They became more ornate from the 1720s onwards and continued to grow in size, although June Swann has noted that they temporarily shrank in the 1750s.[CITATION-27] Early buckles tended to be formed in a \u2018D\u2019 shape, with a simple prong mechanism on one side of the central spindle and a flat section on the other to hold the strap in place: in one example from the 1720s, this takes the form of a pineapple (). At this time the pineapple was exotic and fashionable, and would have been grown in expensive glasshouses: the wearer might therefore have been signalling their sophistication, or the colonial origin of their wealth.[CITATION-28] By the mid-century, there was a huge proliferation of types of buckle for different occasions or to convey specific allegiances. One commentator listed coronation buckles, christening buckles, birthday buckles, Devonshire buckles and political buckles. They could be used to display party loyalties, although this commentator joked that these were \u2018made of, in which theto a considerable degree predominated\u2019: \u2018The BRENTFORD Buckles, dedicated to WILKES and LIBERTY, had but a, because it was discovered that their substance was asas their construction was\u2019.[CITATION-29] Shoe buckle (.1715): Northampton Museum 1977.D82. Courtesy of Northampton Museum and Art Gallery.Buckles reached their height of fashionability and size in the 1770s and 80s. Examples from this period can be strikingly large and heavy: it was common for buckles to be more than 70 mm wide, which would have been the full width of the shoe they were fastening ()\u2014as satirically noted in the actor David Garrick\u2019s prologue to Sheridan\u2019s:Shoe buckle (late 1770s\u20131780s): Northampton Museum 1964.30.2. Courtesy of Northampton Museum and Art Gallery.The buckle then its modest limits knew\u2014Now, like the ocean, dreadful to the view,Hath broke its bounds, and swallows up the shoe;The wearer\u2019s foot, like his once fine estate,Is almost lost, th\u2019is so great.[CITATION-30] These large, highly decorative articles were known as \u2018Artois\u2019 buckles, named after the Comte d\u2019Artois, younger brother of Louis XVI and future Charles X, who was known for his fashionable excess. They were therefore explicitly identified with French fashion and with aristocratic style. Since large buckles were an elite style, it was inappropriate for men of the lower orders to be seen wearing them, and they would be considered presumptuous for doing so.[CITATION-31] Britain\u2019s most celebrated wearer of Artois buckles was the Prince of Wales, later George IV, who was becoming the leader of fashion and a figure around whom opposition Whig politicians could rally. As the \u2018arbiter of taste and elegance\u2019, his fashion choices \u2018were generally adopted by the Gentlemen\u2019.[CITATION-32] His taste for huge buckles did, however, attract negative comment, as his friend Mary Hamilton reported to him in a letter of 8 December 1779:Whilst I was at Mr ____ a gentleman came in & related the following anecdote\u2014wch. perhaps had he known I was in the family he would not have done\u2014\u2018The Prince of Wales is a great Coxcomb in his dress\u2014but he is particularly attentive to the appearance of his feet, & wears such tight shoes & large Buckles that ye King has taken every method to make him leave them off but without effect\u2026\u2019The letter continued:I heard, said he, the other day, that his Majesty after having repeatedly spoke & had ordered Lt. Col. Lake to try to persuade him out of this folly, finding that he was obstinate upon ye subject, took the following method: He took ye Prince on a remarkable long walk though Bogs, up Hills, over stones &c.\u2014the Princes Shoes burst at ye Sides & what with ye weight of ye Buckles & the tightness of ye Shoes & ye length of ye walk his feet were covered with Blisters, & he was quite lame\u2014the King flattered himself he had gained his point, but ye Prince\u2019s obstinacy was proof against his sufferings, & he appeared at Dinner, & every since in tight Shoes and larger Buckles\u2026[CITATION-33] It is clear that these huge buckles could be impractical: other wearers reported them getting tangled in stirrups, or in a partner\u2019s clothes during a dance.[CITATION-34] But their impracticality was no object to men who were determined to achieve the desired look.It seems that many men did, since this period was the heyday of the macaroni. The figure of the macaroni in visual and literary satires was instantly recognisable: their bodies were tall and spindly, their speech and poses were affected, and they were clothed in rich, patterned and brightly coloured fabrics. The macaroni style was all about the accessories: tiny hats, large wigs, bejewelled canes and swords, and heeled shoes with lavish buckles. In Tobias Smollett\u2019s, Captain Whiffle stepped onto the deck of his ship sporting \u2018shoes of blue Meroquin, studded with diamond buckles, that flamed forth rivals to the sun!\u2019[CITATION-35] Smollett insinuated that Whiffle was a sodomite, and the macaroni could be a sexually deviant figure, whose effeminate appearance reflected his sexuality. As Peter McNeil notes, however, this was not necessarily the case, since famously heterosexual men such as Charles James Fox were also identified with the fashion.[CITATION-36] Instead, the macaroni represented effeminacy in a social sense, highlighting the threat to masculinity when polite refinement was taken too far.[CITATION-37] The wearing of buckles was therefore not unrespectable in itself, if not taken to excess.Such was the rage for buckles that it supported a large manufacturing trade. This was largely based around Birmingham, Stafford and Wolverhampton: at its peak, Birmingham alone employed 20,000 people in the trade and produced around 2,500,000 buckles per year, many for the export market.[CITATION-38] Britain became renowned for its metallurgical skills and its products became so desirable that French metalworkers faked British stamps. We should therefore not over-emphasise the foreign associations of the buckle, since this product also had a strong national identity. Birmingham in particular became synonymous with innovative manufacturing processes and the production of new, desirable metal goods, in which it was said to lead the world.[CITATION-39] The town was particularly renowned for its steel buckles, which were \u2018unsurpassed\u2019.[CITATION-40] As a contemporary noted, there was plenty of demand for them: \u2018It is said, that for many years the consumption of buckles in the metropolis was so enormous, that half the luggage of the coaches going from Birmingham to London was supposed to consist of buckles\u2019.[CITATION-41] Following this peak, the decline of buckles in the 1790s was remarkably swift. It was no doubt partly a reaction to a fashion trend that had become unsustainable. Some blamed the buckle-makers themselves for making a product that was too expensive and fast-changing:The buckle-makers introduced changes of fashion so rapidly, that few fortunes were able to follow the succession of round and square, large and small, and people of fortune began to think they could employ \u00a3200 or \u00a3300 a year to better purpose than upon an article which in a few days they were obliged to give as perquisites to servants, or sell for a trifle totally disproportionate to their original cost.[CITATION-42] Given that part of the appeal of buckles had been their novelty\u2014the new styles, new features and innovative manufacturing processes\u2014it is also possible that consumers became bored once they became ubiquitous.The decline of the buckle was, however, largely a reaction to the Revolution in France. Across the Channel, revolutionaries rejected the buckle as monarchical and aristocratic, and instead adopted the shoe tie as a revolutionary symbol.[CITATION-43] Britain followed suit, for a combination of reasons. Radicals sought to display their revolutionary credentials and their rejection of aristocratic mores; loyalists may have rejected a fashion that had formerly been associated with Francophilia and immorality; and others were influenced by the new vogue for. Whatever the cause, men\u2019s style after 1790 became more sober. In a time of war, men adopted the military fashion for trousers worn with boots or laced shoes.[CITATION-44] As Nathaniel Wraxall noted in his memoirs: \u2018It was then that pantaloons, cropped hair and shoe strings, as well as the total abolition of buckles and ruffles, together with the disuse of hair-powder, characterized the men\u2019.[CITATION-45] The traditional ensemble of buckled shoes, stockings and breeches was now only a feature of full dress, to be worn at balls and at court.The change in footwear styles\u2014and how they were fastened\u2014was loaded with meaning, since it related in powerful ways to class, gender, politics and national identity. Giorgio Riello has explored the changing status of shoelaces over time: whereas they had been respectable wear for men in the seventeenth century, they were decidedly unfashionable in the eighteenth and took on new meanings. They could be associated with puritanism, since the godly favoured them over the ostentation of buckles. Others regarded them as slovenly or effeminate, and in 1780s Paris they were apparently a means for homosexual men to identify themselves to each other.[CITATION-46] When laces became fashionable again, the buckle interest in Britain sought to revive these former associations. They condemned laces as \u2018unmanly, absurd and ridiculous\u2019, and a \u2018foreign importation and adoption\u2019.[CITATION-47] They used the traditions of street protest to mock the fashion, parading an ass around Birmingham \u2018with shoe-bows attached to his fetlocks\u2019.[CITATION-48] On the other hand, thenoted that these well-publicised protests backfired, since \u2018many have begun to wear shoe-strings who had never thought of it before\u2019.[CITATION-49] The change in fashion had a huge impact on account of the scale of the buckle trade. Birmingham\u2019s dependence on this \u2018elegant and imagined necessary ornament\u2019 meant that the collapse of the trade was keenly felt, and many families faced destitution.[CITATION-50] The buckle-makers therefore turned to politics for a solution. They pointedly rejected state intervention\u2014similar to the protections afforded to other trades\u2014since they spoke in the idiom of constitutionalism, and did not want to compromise the \u2018liberty\u2019 that their patriotic product represented. Instead, they started a charity subscription to support the buckle-makers and their families, and sought royal favour for their manufactures.[CITATION-51] Deputations of buckle-makers petitioned the royal family to set an example to their subjects by continuing to wear buckles, and to require that they be worn at court and in the military.The manufacturers of the West Midlands petitioned the Prince of Wales on 17 December 1791. The petitioners were introduced to the prince via his friend Sheridan, who was MP for Stafford. Sheridan received some mockery for this in the press[CITATION-52] \u2014which was probably deserved, given how his own plays had mocked the buckle craze. The manufacturers appealed to the prince\u2019s \u2018Goodness, Public Spirit and Humanity\u2019, and trusted that he would prefer \u2018the Blessings of the starving Manufacturers to the Encomiums of the Drawing Room\u2019.[CITATION-53] Following this, in early 1792 the buckle-makers of London presented a series of petitions to members of the royal family. The petition to the king emphasised that he was their \u2018Parent and Protector\u2019, and highlighted the plight of workers \u2018who cannot so easily turn their hands to other Trades\u2019.[CITATION-54] The queen was lauded for her concern for His Majesty\u2019s subjects, and the Prince of Wales was implored to \u2018forbid Shoe Tyes your Royal Presence\u2019. The petition to the Duke of York struck a sentimental tone, invoking the sufferings of the buckle-makers:Will it please your Highness, for a moment, to conceive what immense numbers of persons have spent the prime of their youth and manhood; entered into connections; increased their families, and embarked their all, having this trade for dependance. Their hearts bleeding at the cruel inconsiderate capriciousness of fashion \u2026 The nuptial tye, pitiably relaxed by reiterated sorrows: the children cry louder and more vehemently for food: the husband unmanned: his wonted courage fails: the wife more delicately sensible, is not able to resist one of the obtruding woes which croud into her mind.This passage is highly gendered, emphasising the desire of the male worker for masculine independence, and the victimhood of his wife and children who depend upon him. The genre of the passage is melodrama: the buckle-maker is the hero, his wife is the pure suffering heroine and the villain is not the usual aristocrat, but rather Fashion itself. The buckle-makers therefore made an appeal to hegemonic masculinity, untainted by the newly problematic associations of their product.The longest and most effusive petition was to the Duchess of York. This is comprehensible, given her popularity and the public\u2019s fascination with her feet. Her marriage to the duke caused a sensation, and admiration for her little feet encouraged a generation to squeeze themselves into ill-fitting footwear in order to emulate her look. The petitioners may have been alluding to this when they lay their cause at her \u2018Royal feet\u2019.[CITATION-55] The duchess\u2019s feet feature in one of the more memorable caricatures featuring shoe buckles, James Gillray\u2019s \u2018Fashionable Contrasts, or, The Duchess\u2019s Little Shoe Yielding to the Magnitude of the Duke\u2019s Foot\u2019 (). Here the duke\u2019s huge buckled shoe contrasts with her dainty slipper, shown in what is apparently the missionary position: the connections between feet and sex, which are common in many cultures,[CITATION-56] are here rendered explicit. At a time when buckles were rapidly going out of fashion, the duke\u2019s buckle is here a sign of outdated aristocratic male privilege. The print dates from 24 January 1792, within days of the buckle-makers\u2019 petition, which should therefore be regarded as an important context for the artwork.James Gillray, \u2018Fashionable Contrasts, or, The Duchess\u2019s Little Shoe Yielding to the Magnitude of the Duke\u2019s Foot\u2019 (24 Jan. 1792): Auchincloss Gillray v. 8, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University.Although the petitions were well received at court, the buckle trade was done for. Buckle manufacturers had therefore to find another trade. As it turned out, the same Revolution that had killed off their trade provided a solution, since the declaration of war that followed created new markets. Metalworkers turned their hands to medals and tokens for patriotic consumers,[CITATION-57] and Birmingham became the centre of British arms manufacture.[CITATION-58] It is likely that many former buckle-makers turned their hands to gunmaking: the spring-loaded steel chape that features on late-period buckles resembles a flintlock, so it is probable that their skills were transferrable. Thereafter, the limited demand for buckles was not enough to sustain a major manufacturing sector. They still featured in court dress, and in the formal dress of legal officials, naval officers and the Highland regiments; in wider society they enjoyed occasional revivals and sometimes featured in women\u2019s fashion; but they would never again be the choice for general male wear. Riello notes that the few who continued to wear them gave \u2018signals of conservatism and bigotry\u2019.[CITATION-59] Regency dandies shod themselves in shiny black boots\u2014no less ostentatious or expensive than buckles\u2014and Victorian statesmen gave off a sober, businesslike air in close-fitted wellingtons, or in new laced styles, such as Balmorals or Oxfords.[CITATION-60] A commentator looking back from the 1840s noted that buckles, once universal, were now \u2018neglected and almost unknown\u2019.[CITATION-61] The history of the shoe buckle was therefore complex and ever-changing, and a range of powerful gendered meanings were attributed to them at different times. In order fully to understand this, it is necessary to engage with the buckle as a material object. Studying buckles in museum collections reveals the huge variety of styles: they come in all shapes and sizes, with different decorations and materials, and it is very rare to find two pairs that are alike. Around a fifth of the buckles I handled came with makers\u2019 marks, which helps to place them in terms of date and location: again, it is rare to find two the same, given the large number of small-scale manufacturers. Buckles were originally made by jewellers or toymakers, although the trade was so lucrative that\u2014fatefully\u2014many decided to specialise in buckles. In the eighteenth century, \u2018toy\u2019 referred to a range of fashionable trinkets: Marcia Pointon has suggested that the term was similar to \u2018gizmo\u2019 today.[CITATION-62] As well as having a practical use, buckles were therefore considered fancy, high-tech items that were satisfying to fiddle with, and which gave pleasure to their owners. In this respect they were comparable to horse tackle, a safely masculine domain of consumerism,[CITATION-63] which also consisted of leather fastened by metal buckles.Buckles could be costly, typically more than the shoes that they fastened. Artois buckles were reassuringly expensive. Fine ones could cost 20 guineas, and buckles created with precious stones for special occasions could cost even more: those worn by John Spencer for his wedding were valued at \u00a330,000.[CITATION-64] Fortunes were spent keeping up with the latest fashions. The accounts of the Prince of Wales reveal how much he spent on shoe buckles, in addition to other types of buckle. These ranged in price from \u00a31 1for \u2018A small pair of silver buckles\u2019 to \u00a336 16for \u2018A Pair of rich chased gold Shoe Buckles\u2019, both purchased from the jeweller Thomas Gray. Receipts for the 1780s show just how many he purchased, reaching a peak of eighty-six pairs in 1787 alone. Unfortunately the receipts for the 1790s are missing, so we cannot gauge how far his purchasing mirrored the broader decline of the buckle. After 1800, when they were unfashionable and the styles did not change much, he purchased on average only one or two pairs a year.[CITATION-65] The wealthy owned multiple pairs, but the humble probably did not. A well-made buckle was a good investment: since they were reusable they could last a long time, and the cost of their materials gave them an inherent value. Buckles often featured in wills and they provided a moveable asset to sell, which was particularly valuable for women and other groups who did not have easy access to property. The poet William Cowper was given a pair of silver shoe buckles by his father when he was a schoolboy, \u2018which I kept till I wanted money and then sold them\u2019. When his father enquired after them, he lied that he had removed them to play football, whereupon they had been stolen from his waistcoat pocket.[CITATION-66] As small and valuable items, buckles were eminently stealable, and they often appear in the records of the Old Bailey.[CITATION-67] A new buckle could also alter the appearance of a stolen pair of shoes.[CITATION-68] Buckles were not necessarily expensive, however, and a cheap pair could be acquired for a shilling. A handful of buckles in Northampton Museum\u2019s collection are crudely made and were presumably owned by humble people.[CITATION-69] For the mobile poor, a pair of shoe buckles might be among their few possessions. This was a common trope in literature. One of the prostitutes inrecalls that she was forced to leave home with only the clothes on her back and a few treasured belongings: \u2018My whole stock was two broadpieces of my godmother\u2019s, a few shillings, silver shoe-buckles, and a thimble\u2019.[CITATION-70] A buckle\u2019s expense was largely determined by the materials with which it was made. Buckles were often manufactured from silver and less often from gold. Some carry hallmarks, but the Assay Act of 1739 exempted many buckles from hallmarking: Swann notes that this is a disadvantage for curators, as it makes dating them difficult. Other materials were used as well. Wedgwood developed china buckles, but these were vulnerable to breakage and few survive.[CITATION-71] More important were new techniques for making steel. Alun Withey has shown how cast (or crucible) steel made possible the development of a wide variety of strong, intricate and rust-resistant articles, many of which had a close relationship with the body, such as medical instruments, orthopaedic supports, or items of personal grooming.[CITATION-72] Steel buckles also came from this new technology. Steel could be plated with more valuable metals, or could be buffed to a high shine in its own right. Cut steel \u2018jewels\u2019 could be just as shiny as stones, and Matthew Boulton developed a cost-effective method of casting these separately and riveting them in position.[CITATION-73] Buckles were often associated with the use of substitute materials that were intended to look more expensive than they were. Since they were worn on the feet, they usually avoided close inspection, and it was possible to achieve a lavish look on the cheap. Wearers were conscious that there was a high chance of buckles getting lost or damaged, so economical alternatives were popular. The clockmaker Christopher Pinchbeck developed an alloy that resembled gold, and many buckles were manufactured in this \u2018pinchbeck\u2019, a term that came to be synonymous with anything sham or fraudulent. The association of buckles with inauthenticity was particularly problematic for men, since in the later eighteenth century great store was placed upon a gentleman\u2019s sincerity and the authentic expression of feeling.[CITATION-74] At a time when one\u2019s political personality was founded on property ownership and masculine independence, it was problematic to claim to be wealthier than one was. Pinchbeck\u2019s son Christopher was a politician and cartoonists savagely played on these associations in order to cast doubt on the integrity of this \u2018king\u2019s friend\u2019.[CITATION-75] The issue of authenticity also concerned the stones that adorned buckles. A key way in which the elite displayed their wealth and power in the eighteenth century was the wearing of precious stones. Whereas jewellery in the Renaissance had comprised stones of many colours, in the eighteenth century elites favoured \u2018the dazzling but colourless diamond\u2019.[CITATION-76] As Pointon notes, social life in the period took place indoors after dark, \u2018when artificial lighting enhanced \u2026 the glitter of cut and polished diamonds\u2019.[CITATION-77] Candlelight brought out the brilliance in diamonds, especially when in motion, so diamond-encrusted buckles drew attention to dancing feet. Diamonds were increasingly secured with intricate claw feet, rather than set into the metal, so as to expose their facets to the light. Very few of these diamond shoe buckles survive today since, as Hannah Greig has pointed out, thewould constantly have their precious family diamonds reset into fashionably new pieces.[CITATION-78] In these cases, the buckle itself was expendable and was merely a temporary vehicle for displaying the stones, which would be passed down from generation to generation.Most people, however, could not afford diamonds, and even the wealthy were cautious about wearing precious stones that could easily be lost or stolen. Many eighteenth-century shoe buckles therefore featured \u2018pastes\u2019, which were lead-glass beads fashioned to look like diamonds. Unlike diamond buckles, many of these survive, since pastes were cheap and there was no incentive to reset them. Pastes could be produced in many colours,[CITATION-79] but in practice nearly all were produced in clear glass to emulate diamonds. By these means, the rich could keep their valuable diamonds for special occasions but achieve the same look for general wear, and the less opulent could emulate the rich. As with pinchbeck, fake jewels focused moral commentary upon the falsity of buckles, and, by extension, their wearers. This was a common theme in literature. In Burney\u2019s, Mr Briggs advises the heroine about men who wear quartz in their buckles: \u2018Take care of sharpers; don\u2019t trust shoe-buckles. Nothing but Bristol stones! tricks in all things\u2019.[CITATION-80] This negative moral commentary around buckles contrasts with how their owners felt about them. Buckles were often treasured objects, replete with memories. Richard Grassby has reminded us that \u2018things are often more important for their associations and their past histories than for their ostensible properties\u2019.[CITATION-81] Buckles sometimes carried inscriptions on the underside, particularly initials: when in use, they were hidden from view and close to the body, underlining their personal significance. Because buckles were small and fancy, they were often given as gifts, whether from a family member, a lover or an admirer.[CITATION-82] The Prince of Wales\u2019s early correspondence reveals that he often sent buckles as gifts to his brothers\u2014\u2018Buckles I send you as usual\u2019\u2014which partly explains why he bought so many. He particularly sent them to Frederick when he was based in Hanover and was struggling to obtain fashionable articles.[CITATION-83] Frederick\u2019s replies of thanks were effusive: \u2018I am infinitely obliged to you for the buckles which you was so good as to send me by the Duc d\u2019Aremberg; they are beautiful\u2019.[CITATION-84] In Richardson\u2019s, the heroine\u2019s father was embarrassed to be dressed in humble attire for her wedding, so the wealthy Mr B lent him some of his own clothes: \u2018He was then pleased to give him the silver Buckles out of his own Shoes\u2019. This completed the transformation: \u2018you must expect to see my Father a great Beau\u2019.[CITATION-85] Since shoes are symbolically associated with their wearer\u2014probably more than any other garment\u2014the shoe buckle carries the associations of its owner, but in a way that is more transferable than the shoe itself, which is physically moulded to a particular foot. Shoe buckles were therefore ideal gifts and retained strong personal meanings.Detachability was the key property of the buckle. Pointon compares them to buttons, which in this period were also not necessarily fixed to a particular garment, could be richly decorated and did much more than just fasten.[CITATION-86] The process of fastening a buckle was complex, and is an example of a commonplace physical practice and skill that is now lost to us. The first time a buckle was fitted in place, the two leather straps had to be pierced in just the right places so that the buckle would secure the shoe to the foot without being too tight. Since leather stretches, the wearer would err on the side of tightness for a first fitting. Thereafter the buckle had to be fastened and unfastened every time the shoe was taken on and off. The nursery rhyme \u2018One, two, buckle my shoe\u2019 tells the story of lace-makers getting ready to go to work: it is a counting song and its regular rhythm suggests that this was a physical practice that became second nature through repetition.[CITATION-87] Although one could fasten one\u2019s own buckles, it was helpful to have someone else to do it, so a servant could perform the task for the well-to-do. The surgeon Hampton Weekes recalled visiting a colleague at breakfast, who \u2018begd I would sit down during which time his servant was buckling his Shoes & putting on his Stock\u2019, so it seems that one could eat or chat while the operation was being performed.[CITATION-88] The precise way that this was done depended on the type of fastening. Until about the 1780s this would have been the standard prong pivoting on a central bar, but later examples often feature a spring-loaded chape for easier release. Pairs of spring buckles had to mirror one another in order to achieve a perfectly symmetrical look, so they are often marked \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019 underneath. Their spring mechanisms were, however, intricate and unsightly, and would be made from cheap metal such as iron or steel, so would be hidden behind a solid buckle design rather than an open rim. In order to give the appearance of the latter, they often feature a black patent leather panel in the centre, to match the shoe that they fastened (). Buckles therefore conceal their workings, while providing the appearance of elegance on the outside. A 1790 advertisement in the press for a \u2018New-Invented Brunswick Spring Shoe-Buckle\u2019 boasted:Pair of shoe buckles (early nineteenth century): Northampton Museum 1968.44.9. Courtesy of Northampton Museum and Art Gallery.The ease in wearing this Buckle is evident from the elasticity of the spring giving way to the motion of the foot, as experience proves, requires more liberty than has ever been attended to in the usual mode of fastening, which admits no elasticity, frequently preventing a free circulation.[CITATION-89] They therefore claimed to be healthy: \u2018free circulation\u2019 was the medical ideal at this time, and tight fashionable shoes were frequently condemned for preventing it.The advertisement also emphasised novelty and invention. We should not underestimate the technological precocity of buckles. The Victorians may have looked back on them as an outmoded ornament of thebut, a century before, they were a modern product of the Enlightenment. Buckles are an example of the product innovation that John Styles has identified in eighteenth-century consumerism, given the effort that went into their \u2018product definition, design, differentiation, manufacture and marketing\u2019.[CITATION-90] They were made with cutting-edge materials and processes, in industrial centres, like Birmingham, that were synonymous with invention and progress. Susan Whyman opens her biography of the bookseller William Hutton with an image of a buckle, manufactured in Birmingham from marcasite and steel. She proposes a new social category for men like Hutton, the \u2018rough diamond\u2019: men who lacked breeding and social graces, but achieved a certain amount of social mobility through industry and self-education. Like Birmingham\u2019s buckles, these men \u2018shone\u2019 even though they were hewn from humbler materials.[CITATION-91] This is true to an extent, although marcasite is a fake diamond rather than a rough one: such buckles would never quite be the real thing, just as their wearers would never quite be gentlemen.The almost universal use of buckles as fasteners had implications for the shoes that they fastened. As Garrick\u2019s prologue had bemoaned, the shoe was increasingly just there to hold the buckle. Another commentator agreed that the large buckle \u2018was obliged to have a shoe made on purpose to fasten it\u2019.[CITATION-92] It required a shoe of strong leather and so was more suited to footwear for men than for women, whose shoes of silk or wool would easily be torn by the metal mechanism. Although plain buckles were utilitarian articles that were worn by working people, and by soldiers and sailors, fancy buckles would have restricted the wearer to certain activities and locations. We have seen how the Prince of Wales discovered the inconvenience of large tight buckles on a long rural walk; some large buckles are very heavy, and would have impeded motion, collected dirt and become snagged on things. Buckles that were ornate, valuable and difficult to clean would have been better suited to indoor activities. It was fashionable to wear the buckle close to the toe,[CITATION-93] which would have been little use for fastening: a wealthy or foppish man could thus signal that he did notto walk, unlike working people who did not have the option of a carriage or sedan chair. The physical properties of the buckle therefore help us to understand the meanings that it conveyed.This article has argued that shoe buckles were a characteristic material article of the eighteenth century. They were a product of the Industrial Revolution, manufactured with novel processes in centres of innovation; they were a desirable consumer good, constantly changing to meet and stimulate new fashions; they were the focus of contemporary anxieties about luxury and the social order; their changing fortunes were informed by politics, war and national identity; and, as we will now see, they were an important component of contemporary visions of the masculine body. Shoe buckles were particularly significant for men. Although buckles are an unusual example of an eighteenth-century fashion that was adopted by both men and women, women concealed them under long skirts and never wore the huge buckles of the late century. Women may have attracted more criticism from moralists for wearing ornaments, but Pointon notes that men were no less fond of jewellery in this period:Shoe buckles, snuff-boxes, sword-hilts, canes with fancy heads, watches, buttons \u2026 seals and the crimson ribbons that attached them to a button hole that could be seductively glimpsed peeping from a waistcoat and, in particular, finger rings were all prized, highly visible and expressive components of male attire.[CITATION-94] A correspondent toin 1800 defended women from critics of their fashion choices, given that men like him had imposed miseries on barbers, buckle-makers, dealers in wig powder \u2018and other persons half ruined by our fashionable schemes\u2019.[CITATION-95] We therefore need to assess how we approach decorative items like buckles in relation to masculinity. It is certainly true that excessively decorative or impractical buckles could be criticised for effeminacy or foppery: they feature prominently in the macaroni caricatures of the period, and their association with French fashion could put them at odds with vigorous national masculinity. On the other hand, the alternative to shoe buckles\u2014laces\u2014were more problematic for men, at least until the 1790s when their respective meanings reversed. Before this, buckles could be associated with manliness. In family portraits, buckles could be a means of distinguishing older from younger brothers, since buckles were a feature of adult male dress.[CITATION-96] Working men wore them too, since a buckled leather shoe was more comfortable and socially aspirational than a wooden clog. Sailors prided themselves on their shiny buckles: Beverly Lemire notes that they were a sign of their \u2018manliness and worthy character\u2019.[CITATION-97] Common soldiers\u2019 buckles were often covered by gaiters, but they were proudly worn by Highland regiments as part of the kilt ensemble. A pair of soldier\u2019s buckles dating from the 1790s is held by the National Army Museum. They were worn by a private or an NCO and are fairly plain: they have a smooth rectangular rim that is probably made from brass, and no decorations that would snag or make them difficult to clean. This was a smart article rather than a fancy one. Nevertheless, they have been buffed to a high shine, and were weighty items to wear on one\u2019s feet, measuring more than 60 mm across.[CITATION-98] As Scott Hughes Myerly has argued, we should not assume that impractical elements of military uniforms were operational impediments, since they contributed to the soldier\u2019s image and bearing, and were therefore thought to have an important emotional effect on their wearers.[CITATION-99] The shoe buckle helped to project a particular image of the masculine body. Eighteenth-century ideals of male beauty emphasised the shapely leg, which elite men showed off in leather breeches and silk stockings, terminating in a shiny black leather shoe set off by a buckle. Anne Hollander has argued that dress serves to constitute the bodily ideals of its time, to the extent that the nude needs to be seen in the context of clothing fashions. Dress is therefore not just a surface covering and bodies are not pre-cultural, but are normative ideals that are actively produced. The mid-eighteenth-century ensemble consisted of several layers that were fitted but not tailored, emphasising the length of the torso and narrowness of the shoulders. This lent itself to a curved standing posture, as emphasised by portraiture of the age.[CITATION-100] The polite body was elongated and elegant, and was cultivated through dance and other forms of bodily discipline in order to move in a graceful way.[CITATION-101] Shiny buckles encrusted with jewels caught the light in order to highlight the polite body in motion. Buckles were integral to this wider look and therefore helped to construct the masculine body in the eighteenth century.If buckles only made sense in the context of the coat-and-breeches ensemble, they quickly disappeared along with it. The sharp fall of the buckle therefore needs to be placed in the context of the wider shift in men\u2019s fashions in the 1790s. As we have seen, this has traditionally been explained in terms of the \u2018great masculine renunciation\u2019, whereby men\u2019s clothes became more plain and uniform. The rapid fall of the buckle around 1791, however, seems too quick for a broad historical process that, Kuchta argues, took three centuries.[CITATION-102] Moreover, the fashions that replaced it were hardly less showy. Highly polished black boots shone almost as much as buckles, and their close fit served to emphasise the contours of the body. These were worn with high-waisted trousers and padded jackets that projected a very different body image from the mid-Georgian ensemble, emphasising the genitals and the brawn of the upper torso. As Karen Harvey has argued, this focused attention on the male form rather than detracted from it, often in a pointedly erotic way: men\u2019s political power arguably became more embodied rather than the reverse.[CITATION-103] Joanne Begiato further argues that this change has to be explained in terms of social class, since \u2018the feeling, graceful, and refined body appeared less useful in an age of revolution and war; certainly, the more robust fighting working-class bodies of sailors, soldiers, and boxers were depicted as particularly appealing and reassuring\u2019.[CITATION-104] The nineteenth century valued the industrious arm of the working man over the elegant leg of the gentleman, so did not need to draw attention to the latter with a glistening ornament.Material things that are worn on the body therefore have implications for gender and the self. Literary scholars of the Renaissance have argued that \u2018prosthetic\u2019 articles, such as codpieces and handkerchiefs, contributed to gender identity, since they were regarded as coextensive with the body. They tend to suggest that this ceased by the eighteenth century with the rise of the modern individual, whereby exterior things became superfluous to the bounded self.[CITATION-105] As we have seen, however, worn material articles such as the buckle continued to inform understandings of masculinity, the body and personal worth. In the eighteenth century, one\u2019s standing and social credit were often assessed, not in terms of one\u2019s actual wealth, but in terms of \u2018dress, manner, verbal facility and connection\u2019. This underlined the importance of personal refinement and material display but, as Margot Finn has noted, made social capital very unstable.[CITATION-106] It was therefore not the decorativeness of bucklesthat was problematic for men, but rather the suspicion that the wearer claimed to be something that they were not. The widespread use of substitute materials in buckles\u2014pinchbeck, pastes and quartz\u2014associated them with artifice. Furthermore, as buckles became more sophisticated, more of their workings were concealed in the interests of achieving a particular look. This was particularly troubling for men in the later eighteenth century, who were encouraged to live up to the ideals of sincerity and emotional authenticity.In a fluid consumer society, where your credentials were established not by your known worth but by your appearance, articles like buckles therefore became the focus of anxieties about personal authenticity and the social order. Historians often argue that the later eighteenth century ushered in a new regime of selfhood, where formerly playful and performative identities were replaced with apparently objective categories such as race, biological sex and social class.[CITATION-107] For men in particular, this involved a shift in their way their virtue was evaluated, from outer display of manners and accoutrements, to the \u2018inner man\u2019 that reflected the true sentiments of his heart.[CITATION-108] A figure-hugging boot revealed the \u2018true\u2019 man, where the decorative buckle had concealed it. The fall of the buckle around 1790 was therefore bound up with new ways of understanding social and gendered identities. If the eighteenth century is a pivotal period between the early modern and the modern worlds, then a fashion trend that was ubiquitous from the 1690s to the 1790s arguably epitomises this period of transition. The buckle may well be alien to shoe wearers today, but it helped to make us modern."

    "author": "Justin Willis",
    "date": "23 August 2023",
    "text": "In July 1970, Uganda\u2019s President Milton Obote published\u2014under his own name\u2014a plan for a new system of single-party elections. \u2018Document Number Five\u2019, as it was called, offered a radical solution to a profound problem. Africa\u2019s nationalist politicians had committed themselves to adult suffrage and the secret ballot as an affirmation of the existence of the nation. Yet they feared that an untutored public, encouraged by unscrupulous politicians, would make the wrong electoral choices. Obote\u2019s complex electoral plan was designed to enforce a national approach to campaigning. Yet, more than that, Document Number Five itself was imagined as the focus for a public political discussion that would educate and enlighten the public and discipline political opportunists. Uganda\u2019s English-language media\u2014dominated by a relatively small group, whose educational privilege had brought them to positions of power\u2014became the forum for this discussion. It was a constrained discussion, conducted in the shadow of intimidation, but it was neither predictable nor entirely scripted. Those who wrote and spoke had a wary eye on their personal safety and their careers, but they also had a sense of themselves as intellectuals, whose words mattered to themselves and to others. While the planned elections never took place\u2014forestalled by Idi Amin\u2019s coup\u2014those who spoke and wrote about Document Number Five affirmed the sense of those involved that politics was fundamentally tutelary and that it was their right, and duty, to guide those who were less educated.On 27 July 1970, Jeremiah Opira hosted a meeting in Kitgum, northern Uganda. In attendance was a select audience of local officials from the ruling party, the Uganda People\u2019s Congress (UPC), and \u2018youth leaders\u2019 from the area. Opira worked in the capital, Kampala, as deputy head of the government\u2019s intelligence organisation. But he himself was from the north and had been at primary school in Kitgum. That had been the beginning of a journey of education and employment\u2014not untypical for a small minority of late colonial subjects\u2014that took him to senior school in neighbouring Kenya, work as a teacher and headteacher, and then to a rapid rise through the ranks of the civil service after Ugandan independence in 1962.[CITATION-1] Returning to Kitgum, he was very much the local man who had made a successful national career.According to the report of the Kitgum meeting published in the UPC\u2019s party newspaper, Opira used the event to explain a major political innovation. Two weeks earlier, Uganda\u2019s President Milton Obote had announced a plan for an entirely new single-party electoral system in a lengthy tract that he had presented as Document Number Five\u2014the last in a series of policy statements that set out a \u2018Move to the Left\u2019 in politics. Opira characterised the central document in that series, the Common Man\u2019s Charter, as a material promise \u2018to provide every citizen with sufficient standard [] of living particularly clothing, food and shelter\u2019. On the election plan, Opira\u2019s speech to his audience emphasised a concern with performance for an international gaze; Obote\u2019s plans, he said, \u2018would demonstrate to the whole world that an African state and government\u2019 could \u2018innovate a system where democracy is practised\u2019. But more than that, the proposed elections\u2014combining single-party politics with an innovative voting system\u2014would change both politicians and voters in Uganda itself, in pursuit of the aims of the Move to the Left. The effect of the earlier elections that preceded independence had been pernicious, Opira said: some MPs had turned their constituencies \u2018into a kraal from which they get the means of living\u2019. Under the new system, he insisted that \u2018consciousness would be reciprocally instilled in the electorate and the elected\u2019. He ended his talk with an appeal: his audience should \u2018explain to the masses\u2019 the importance of the system. As they left, following a performance by a local dance troupe, Opira\u2019s wife presented all the attendees with cloths bearing Obote\u2019s image.[CITATION-2] This little vignette is rich in possible readings, each of which might speak to aspects of governmentality in post-independence Africa. Why did performances by dancers frame the event? How should we understand the gendering of speech- and gift-giving? What does the travel of the word(from Portuguese to colonial South Africa to wider imperial usage and then to the post-colony) tell us about languages of government? The newspaper article presented the event as a headmasterly talk by Opira, but studies elsewhere have reminded us of the danger of seeing such events as no more than a lecture to the audience; surely, messages flowed both ways.[CITATION-3] But the focus of this article is not on the event, but on the newspaper report itself. What kinds of work were people\u2014mostly men\u2014such as Opira seeking to do through the public statements about elections that appeared in the media?On the same day that Opira spoke with his audience in Kitgum, Felix Onama\u2014who was both secretary-general of the UPC and minister of defence\u2014was in a television studio in Kampala, hailing the election plan as \u2018revolutionary, original and highly democratic\u2019, and saying that it would \u2018prove to the whole world how well this system was democratic\u2019.[CITATION-4] Television reached a tiny audience at the time (there were only 9,000 TV sets in the country in 1969), but\u2014like Opira\u2019s meeting\u2014Onama\u2019s words (or at least a version of them) found their way into the print media.[CITATION-5] For several months, Uganda\u2019s media carried regular commentary and discussion on the election plan. Much of this took the form of praise but there was also detailed discussion, even opposition\u2014sometimes overt, sometimes half-hidden.To call this media coverage a debate would risk overstating its openness: as will be shown, it was constrained by both self-censorship and intimidation. Nor can we assume that it was a window on political discourse generally: behind the often stilted language of the newspaper article or radio broadcast there was a vast swirl of everyday argument, gossip, rumour and conversation\u2014from the secret backroom conspiracies of political leaders to the political chatter of the bar. Cramped and unrepresentative, the media coverage might also seem ultimately irrelevant. Discussion of possible elections, which had begun in 1967 and peaked in these few months in 1970, finally came to nothing, curtailed by the coup in January 1971 that brought Idi Amin to power.Yet the newspaper record\u2014and the imperfect, partial record captured by monitors working for the Summary of World Broadcasts\u2014is revealing. The surviving archival record of debates within Uganda\u2019s government is anyway exiguous, but more importantly the media discussion raises a question that can be summarised simply: why did so much energy and time go into public speaking and writing about a complex plan for elections in an authoritarian state? That elections were seen to be important is striking; that there was a degree of public disagreement about how they should be held is even more so. The answer suggested here is that the media coverage of the elections was in itself a kind of political work. When Basil Bataringaya\u2014former opposition politician turned government stalwart\u2014told Uganda\u2019s parliament that \u2018elections serve a useful purpose in nation-building, in the mobilisation of political consciousness and in the control of leaders\u2019, both his speech and its subsequent reproduction on radio and in the press made claims about Bataringaya himself and about Uganda\u2019s politics that spoke to a specific audience.[CITATION-6] In Uganda, as elsewhere in Africa, newspapers have been seen as lacking in critical freedom, and vulnerable to government control\u2014whether because of direct ownership by government or ruling party (as in the case of, one of Uganda\u2019s two national English-language newspapers) or because the foreign companies that owned them were reluctant to fall foul of independent African governments (as in the case of the, the other national English-language paper, which from 1967 was part of the Lonrho group).[CITATION-7] The history of Uganda\u2019s media has been cast as a \u2018struggle for freedom\u2019 between a controlling government and a body of journalists dedicated to liberal principles.[CITATION-8] Yet the boundaries between journalists, politicians, civil servants and party activists were often unclear, and from their beginnings in the early twentieth century Ugandan newspapers had largely been created to pursue particular political agendas rather than any abstract notion of freedom.[CITATION-9] Vulnerability did not make newspapers irrelevant: constrained in their content and read only by a literate minority, they nonetheless provided a public forum for that minority, who read the press closely as they navigated the perils of a politically tumultuous time.Radio broadcasts in Amin\u2019s Uganda have been characterised as part of a \u2018politics of exhortation\u2019 aimed at the population as a whole.[CITATION-10] Elsewhere in Africa it has been argued that, where the print media is closely constrained by the state, journalists learn to write to \u2018naturalise the authority of state officials\u2019; Marissa Moorman has noted of Angola that \u2018state broadcasters have national ambitions\u2019.[CITATION-11] But it is not clear that the imagined national audience was always listening, or reading. Moorman has also noted that listening communities were actually diverse, and another recent study has suggested that media work can produce multiple distinct \u2018publics\u2019.[CITATION-12] The debate over Document Number Five suggests that writing and broadcasting in the English language allowed a relatively discrete group of broadcasters, writers and readers to assert\u2014and argue over\u2014their distinctive place in Ugandan politics. In pretending to speak to the nation, they were talking to, and about, one another. Like Florence Brisset-Foucault\u2019s recent study of radio talk shows in twenty-first century Uganda, this is an investigation of what could, and could not be said\u2014and of the role of public statements in claiming political authority.[CITATION-13] The focus here is therefore on newspapers and radio broadcasts in the English language\u2014not because these were the only forum for political debates among Ugandans (these went on in many ways, in multiple languages) but because they were central to public self-representation by Uganda\u2019s elite.That approach allows us to consider the protagonists, at least in part, as they saw themselves\u2014as intellectuals, whose statements made claims about themselves as \u2018educators of the masses\u2019 (as one of them put it).[CITATION-14] Those involved included a spy master with aspirations to be a poet, the editor of a critical arts magazine, sundry academics, angry students and a wider cast of politicians and civil servants. This \u2018small restless group\u2019\u2014as one of their own number later called them\u2014used their talk about elections to assert a profoundly tutelary understanding of politics.[CITATION-15] This valorised their shared claim to authority\u2014as they talked and wrote, they cast the people of Uganda as holders of sovereign authority, yet also as subjects in need of education. Voters, they argued, did not fully understand the consequences of their choices. Vulnerable to political opportunists, the electorate required instruction.At the same time, the media reportage revealed both self-fashioning and a project of mutual discipline by that group of literate English-speakers. Uganda had a considerable press in other languages\u2014notably Luganda, spoken in Uganda\u2019s economic and governmental centre, the former southern kingdom of Buganda, where there had been a lively and enthusiastically political press since the early colonial period.[CITATION-16] By the mid-1960s newspapers and radio were, as one observer noted, \u2018a necessity for the educated elite and influentials\u2019, and English-language media carried a particular weight\u2014despite their modest circulation.[CITATION-17] The colonial language was in effect the national language and was entangled with \u2018nation-building\u2019: prosperity was the promised reward for overcoming ethnic division, and English was seen as the tool for that overcoming.[CITATION-18] Luganda, meanwhile, was inevitably associated with the persistent force of Buganda political exceptionalism (on which, more below).[CITATION-19] Law gave legal force to the linkage of national politics and English: candidates for parliament had to prove their proficiency in English.[CITATION-20] The colonial language conjured an audience that was international, as well as national: writing in English, Uganda\u2019s intellectuals could see themselves as part of debates that were continental and global in scale.English was a language of estrangement as well as power. Public political events routinely involved performances of a linguistic hierarchy of difference: national politicians addressed local crowds in English, pausing for translators to render their message into vernacular languages. The Ugandan poet Okot p\u2019Bitek (writing in English) described post-independence African politics as \u2018government by the educated, for the educated. You cannot become a member of their parliament unless you speak English or French\u2019.[CITATION-21] Vernacular press journalists complained that Uganda\u2019s elite were only interested in the English-language media.[CITATION-22] Those who used the colonial language were constantly aware that their very claims to status might rob them of legitimacy: they feared to be seen as members of a lucky elite who\u2014as another poet, Taban lo Liyong, bitingly put it\u2014had \u2018fallen into things\u2019 and lost touch with the people.[CITATION-23] Discussing Document Number Five through the English-language media asserted status; but it also became a way to express anxieties about self-seeking elitism, and to imagine an electoral framework that would constrain the elite\u2019s own behaviours.In approaching the subject as an exercise in intellectual history, this study deviates from the path of previous scholarship on the topic. Generally sceptical of the viability of the plan, a little flurry of scholarly writing around the time of Document Number Five was nonetheless broadly sympathetic, some of it written by individuals who were themselves active in the discussions (which took an ostentatiously academic turn). This literature was informed by the same basic understanding that shaped Document Number Five: that the nation needed building, and that the election plan was\u2014at least on one level\u2014a genuine attempt to overcome ethnic and regional divisions that threatened that task.[CITATION-24] Subsequent writing has been more cursory, and generally less kind. It has either offered a partisan insistence on the insincerity of Obote (who manipulated elections in 1980 to come back to power for a second term which was generally bloody and disastrous) or\u2014in more general literature\u2014subsumed this story into a wider narrative of Africa\u2019s retreat from democracy after independence, in which alternative electoral visions such as Document Number Five are no more than the self-interested scheming of insecure authoritarians.[CITATION-25] Those who devised and argued over Document Number Five were indeed insecure and authoritarian and the evidence points to plenty of scheming. The ballot was conceived as a disciplinary and educational project: the plan was for a version of the \u2018elections without choice\u2019 that became common in Africa at this time.[CITATION-26] Yet it is argued here that the course of events was not inevitable, and those involved saw their behaviour as more than crude self-interest. To speak or write in public was a risk, as well as a way of making a claim, and the actors in these events were trying to shape their future, and that of Uganda, with their public words; their sense of themselves as intellectuals, with a duty to debate and a right to educate, was crucial to their behaviour. In focusing on their published words, this study takes their claims seriously.Document Number Five was rooted in an understanding of Uganda\u2019s political situation that was widely shared, certainly among those who wrote and commented in English. Writing in an Africa-focused, US-published journal in 1961, shortly before independence, a Ugandan studying for a masters degree in the USA argued that Uganda was an extreme case of a wider condition. Colonial rule had created political units, while at the same time insisting that the populations of these units were so incorrigibly diverse in language and culture that all government structures and practices must be predicated on that disunity. Yet, from the 1940s, imperial powers sought to reinvent colonial rule as an exercise in political as well as social and economic development, and unitary government suddenly became the goal. Subjects who sought to end colonial rule found that, in a world now imagined as one of sovereign nations, unity was the price of freedom from empire. As the author Joseph Mubiru explained, nationalists \u2018had to fight two enemies, colonialism and tribalism\u2019.[CITATION-27] Uganda\u2019s particularly acute version of this condition arose from the prolonged, on-off British alliance with powerful figures in the kingdom of Buganda, who had amassed wealth and status while ensuring a special position for the kingdom that called Uganda\u2019s unity into question.Mubiru\u2014who had taken his first degree in India in the 1950s\u2014was only one of many who made similar arguments, and the artificiality of Uganda as a colonial creation became something of an intellectual commonplace among Ugandans\u2014the routine introduction to any political history.[CITATION-28] So too did the notion that Buganda\u2019s distinctive politics made Uganda an especially challenging terrain for nationalism, because the few who had been \u2018enlightened\u2019 by education\u2014who should have been nationalist leaders\u2014were inclined to see their interests in ethnic terms, not national ones.[CITATION-29] It was widely accepted\u2014among intellectuals, at least\u2014that ethnic difference (which was compounded rather than ameliorated by a cross-cutting sectarian divide between Catholic and Protestant) threatened the future Ugandan nation. By the time Mubiru was writing his article, two parties, each avowedly nationalist, were competing for dominance\u2014the UPC and the Democratic Party, or DP. Bitterly rivalrous though they were, politicians from both parties shared the same tutelary idea of politics as nation-building: the people required \u2018enlightenment\u2019.[CITATION-30] In preparing English-language statements to be published in the press, both UPC and DP election candidates presented their role as the \u2018dissemination of knowledge\u2019, a \u2018fight against ignorance\u2019: \u2018We must educate our people so that they can begin to see further than the frontiers of their own districts\u2019.[CITATION-31] Many Ugandan politicians apparently shared the reported concern of Grace Ibingira, another UPC leader, that the \u2018common man\u2019 only understood the language of \u2018tribe or religion\u2019.[CITATION-32] That vision of nationalist politics as tutelary was heavily inflected by the abrupt late colonial lurch towards teaching citizenship, and was by no means unique to Uganda. The \u2018mass education\u2019 imagined by late imperial policy was a political as well as an economic project: people must be taught to be governed.[CITATION-33] Before the independence of what became Tanzania, Julius Nyerere declared that people \u2018must learn to think as a nation\u2019; the Zambian nationalist leader Kenneth Kaunda wrote of the urgent need for a \u2018high level of national intelligence and education\u2019.[CITATION-34] In the 1960s, academic analysis echoed the anxieties of departing colonial officials and nationalist politicians: \u2018political socialisation\u2019 became the vogue term for the urgently felt need to teach people how to be citizens.[CITATION-35] But Uganda was seen as particularly threatened by division, and its people especially in need of tutelary politics, partly because of the messy and inconsistent British policy around independence. As the imagined slow timetable for self-government turned swiftly to plans for a rapid withdrawal at the end of the 1950s, the British had feared that the intransigence of Buganda\u2019s ruler, the, would tear Uganda apart even before they could leave. They sought simultaneously to placate Bugandan particularism and to grant swift independence to Uganda as a nation. Obote had become the leader of the nationalist UPC party when it was created in 1960 as a determined advocate of national unity. But in 1962, as independence negotiations stalled, he seized the moment to offer an electoral pact to theand his supporters, offering Buganda special status after independence.For some this seemed an unprincipled compromise with tribalism, but Obote, writing in the press for an English-speaking audience, defended his deal as a necessary expedient: \u2018unity and understanding\u2019 were the goals of the party, but the problem was that people had \u2018loyalty\u2019 to their traditions and there was a need to overcome their \u2018fear\u2019 of central government\u2014the task of his party was to \u2018effect unity on [] the country and amongst the people of Uganda\u2019.[CITATION-36] The deal carried the UPC to victory in the 1962 elections\u2014making Obote prime minister at independence in that year, and allowing theto become titular president of Uganda shortly afterwards. Speaking to the party conference shortly afterwards (in a speech which was published in, a new English-language journal for culture and politics, published in Uganda), Obote insisted that, whatever the deal with Buganda, Uganda was \u2018one country with one National Parliament and Government\u2019.[CITATION-37] The thoroughly predictable unravelling of Obote\u2019s deal with thein the aftermath of independence has been well described elsewhere.[CITATION-38] The climax came in 1966, when in the space of a few weeks Obote first arrested a group within the UPC (including Ibingira) who were challenging his leadership and then sent soldiers to seize the royal palace in Buganda. In 1967, Buganda and other, smaller kingdoms were abolished and Obote was declared president under a new constitution, approved by the parliament that had been elected in 1962 (many opposition members having crossed the floor to join the UPC, avowedly as a display of their commitment to unity). Obote hailed these events as a \u2018revolution\u2019, and in an article for a regional intellectual and political journal published in Nairobi argued that \u2018feudalism\u2019 had been overthrown.[CITATION-39] An article indefended the new constitution in a way that justified it in tutelary terms.With the achievement of independence on the 9th day of October, 1962, we nominally achieved a degree of unity. Many persons still thought in terms of locality and tribalism \u2026 Time and certain measures were necessary to help develop national feelings.[CITATION-40] The author of that article was Akena Adoko\u2014Opira\u2019s boss at the head of the intelligence service. Adoko had studied in Sudan, India and the USA, and saw himself as something of a polymath. The head of Uganda\u2019s Law Society, he was also a regular pseudonymous journalist and public speaker, and chose to publish his analysis of the events of 1966 in the form of an epic poem\u2014in English.[CITATION-41] He argued that popular parochialism could only be overcome by strong central authority. Garnishing his arguments with references to Locke and Paine, Adoko insisted that the right to govern was derived from education:Now, in Uganda, our electors who consist of people of no formal education and no training in the art of modern government have resigned themselves to the necessity of selecting as their representatives, persons with more knowledge on such things and persons who speak a foreign language which is not known to them but which is legally the national language \u2026 They appreciate that knowledge must, in the light of a given premise, lead, in all good faith, to a different conclusion from that of ignorance, and the conclusion derivable from knowledge has greater chances of being right than that derivable from ignorance.Adoko\u2019s article was a response to Obote\u2019s expressed wish that the introduction of the constitution should exemplify \u2018government by discussion\u2019\u2014a notion of consensual rather than oppositional democracy that had been articulated (in the pages of) by Julius Nyerere, Tanzania\u2019s leader, as a distinctively African political form.[CITATION-42] As Picho Ali, head of the president\u2019s newly established \u2018Research Section\u2019 (also known as the \u2018Research Office\u2019)\u2014which was closely associated with the intelligence service\u2014explained, discussion was a tool for popular instruction, and \u2018[o]ne of the most vital processes of democracy is to educate the masses\u2019.[CITATION-43] After minor amendments and some brave critical speeches in parliament from the surviving rump of the opposition and a handful of UPC members, the constitution was passed. It seems unlikely that this discussion had much influence on \u2018the masses\u2019, confined as it largely was to the pages of\u2014though the editor of the UPC party paper hailed it as evidence that the media could be \u2018nationalist\u2019 and educational\u2019, even as he lamented the wider failings of an \u2018elitist press\u2019.[CITATION-44] It did, however, provide opportunity to rehearse for English-speaking readers and listeners the argument that popular \u2018ignorance\u2019\u2014as Adoko had put it\u2014must be overcome. As Obote reportedly told parliament (in a comment printed in), full parliamentary democracy was not yet possible because \u2018there were certain matters that came with it that were lacking in Uganda\u2019. The persistent corollary to the theme of popular ignorance was concern about abuse of power by the educated: Obote was also quoted inas saying that \u2018those who saw the inside of universities\u2019 had \u2018brought shame on Africa\u2019.[CITATION-45] A few months later, Adoko echoed the point in a television discussion, reprinted as an article: \u2018the masses\u2019 were ignorant and vulnerable to \u2018mental acrobats\u2019 who abused their education to mislead the people. Genuine\u2014that is, nationalist\u2014intellectuals had a duty to guide the people to save them from these \u2018so-called intellectuals\u2019.[CITATION-46] As well as abolishing the kingdoms, and making Obote president, the new constitution allowed the postponement of elections by resetting the parliamentary clock. Through 1967 and 1968, press coverage relayed the message from Obote and others in the UPC that premature elections would compromise Uganda\u2019s stability: the people were still too vulnerable to manipulation and so were not yet ready for the ballot.[CITATION-47] But from 1969, public discussion began to take a new direction, as it became possible for the media to publish divergent opinions on the question of elections. That change was preceded, ironically, by the effective suppression ofin 1968. That has been widely understood as an act of censorship by an increasingly authoritarian regime. It clearly was this\u2014but it can also be understood as the muddled consequence of a spat among Uganda\u2019s \u2018restless few\u2019.[CITATION-48] There had already been warning noises from Onama and Obote about\u2019s propagation of \u2018foreign ideas\u2019.[CITATION-49] The revelation thathad been unknowingly receiving financial support from a CIA front organisation had not helped. But the trigger for crisis came in the wake of an article by Picho Ali\u2014initself\u2014demanding that court judgments should be guided by the \u2018aims and objectives\u2019 of the state.[CITATION-50] printed multiple critical responses. Some came from young radicals\u2014one a student in Dar es Salaam, the second yet another UK-trained lawyer\u2014who mocked Ali\u2019s claim that there had been a \u2018revolution\u2019, and stressed the need for those who worked in government to \u2018decolonise the mind\u2014mental emancipation\u2014through education\u2019.[CITATION-51] More stinging commentary came from Abu Mayanja, a veteran politician and a barrister, whose political trajectory had carried him from ardent nationalism to a period of study in Cambridge, then to support for the, then into the ranks of the UPC. Mayanja shared the vision of tutelary government\u2014in 1960, he had reportedly remarked that democracy was \u2018a \u201chabit of mind\u201d which it will take his poorly educated country many years to attain\u2019.[CITATION-52] But he denounced Ali\u2019s argument as an attack on the judiciary\u2014and took the opportunity both to twit the author for the poor quality of his Soviet legal training and to imply that ethnic politics had delayed the appointment of new judges.[CITATION-53] Mayanja was arrested; so too was Rajat Neogy, the editor and publisher of(though the police first arrested the editor of the party newspaper by mistake). The offending edition of the magazine was allowed to circulate, and Obote made a public show of insisting thatwas not banned and, indeed, that everyone should read it. Mayanja and Neogy were charged with sedition but acquitted, the judge mordantly observing that\u2018had a limited appeal, and would be read by few people\u2019. Released from detention, Neogy\u2014and the magazine\u2014moved to Ghana in 1969 (a particularly galling choice for Obote, for reasons explained below).[CITATION-54] Obote was evidently hurt by the international criticism that attended these events. Whennewspaper in the UK carried a story lamenting the arrests, Obote wrote a long letter to the editor, insisting that his government was not authoritarian and was beset by conspirators.[CITATION-55] Addressing a seminar for journalists in late 1968, Adoko exhorted them to ensure their \u2018intellectual independence\u2019, but insisted that the threat to this came from the \u2018financiers\u2019 of the press, not the government.[CITATION-56] In September 1969\u2014aswas publishing its first issue in Ghana\u2014a special supplement appeared inof London, casting Obote in a sympathetic light as a leader struggling to achieve unity, and presenting him as a patron of academic seminars on policy issues and Akena Adoko as the intellectual host of television discussion programmes. That supplement was partly written by Ali Mazrui, professor in political science at Makerere University, who had been instrumental in mobilising a carefully phrased but effective campaign of support for Neogy and Mayanja. Mazrui, who had been publicly vilified by Obote, was then privately reassured of the president\u2019s fondness for.[CITATION-57] This messy act of suppression set the uncertain context for the media discussion of elections in 1969 and 1970. That discussion was partly driven by events elsewhere, for the postponement of elections was beginning to make Uganda seem out of line. Tanzania had held post-independence elections in 1965, and was preparing for a second round of such elections in 1970. In Zambia\u2014whose president, Kenneth Kaunda, was, with Obote and Nyerere, a member of the informal \u2018Mulungushi club\u2019 of self-styled radical national leaders\u2014the ruling party had won elections overwhelmingly in 1968.[CITATION-58] Kenya held national elections in December 1969. The spectacular politics of stateness in the region meant that, at summits and at annual commemorations of independence, Obote was increasingly on show alongside presidents whose legitimacy was newly burnished by electoral success. On the other side of the continent\u2014but looming large for Uganda\u2019s intellectuals\u2014Ghana held elections in 1969, after a prolonged transition following the overthrow of Kwame Nkrumah in 1966. Nkrumah, arguably Africa\u2019s most prominent politician of the independence era, had treated Obote and the UPC rather as prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.[CITATION-59] The coup that toppled him was denounced (not without cause) as the result of neo-colonialist conspiracy; when the coup leader passed through Uganda\u2019s airportto a meeting in Ethiopia, Obote seized the opportunity to confront him publicly.[CITATION-60] But an alternative narrative presented Nkrumah\u2019s fall as the result of having lost touch with the people\u2014most starkly evidenced in Ghana\u2019s \u2018elections\u2019 of 1965, in which no ballots were cast and every ruling party candidate (including Nkrumah) was returned unopposed. Mazrui had used a book review into state that argument publicly.[CITATION-61] Angry readers denounced Mazrui, but the argument struck home: the British High Commissioner reported privately that Obote had concluded that Nkrumah had failed to \u2018keep in touch with reality\u2019.[CITATION-62] Circumstances within Uganda also encouraged discussion of elections and raised the possibility that, rather than being a threat, the ballot might itself be the means to educate the public. Despite Obote\u2019s boast that the \u2018revolution\u2019 had vanquished feudalism, he and others were acutely aware of the persistent support for the monarchy in Buganda after 1966. Leaflets written in the name of a \u2018Secret Council\u2019 circulated widely, threatening violence against the state, and there were sporadic actual attacks, including one on Obote\u2019s motorcade in 1968.[CITATION-63] The government\u2019s response was partly blunt repression\u2014the arrest and detention without trial of a significant number of real or imagined opponents, including the main leaders of the DP. The characterisation of this period as a \u2018consolidation of dictatorship\u2019 in which space for debate was closed down is partly accurate.[CITATION-64] But Obote and his allies also saw the challenge as an educational one, and imagined the ballot as a solution to this\u2014and as a way to turn the ruling party into a more effective tool of control.The UPC had always been a problem for Obote. In his rhetoric, the party was a vanguard of transformation. In practice, it was a consortium of locally influential \u2018big men\u2019. After independence the party had been riven by a struggle between a minority of young radicals and this established hierarchy. In that struggle Obote had leaned first towards the big men and then\u2014once the radicals were excluded from key offices\u2014increasingly against them. Among academics, the weakness of the UPC, and its dominance by regional big men, was accepted fact.[CITATION-65] Whether or not Obote read their articles, his occasional presence at campus drinking-holes\u2014in a university environment shaped by the radicalism of the later 1960s\u2014would have ensured that he was well aware of this intellectual critique.[CITATION-66] In 1968, he had begun talking of the need to revive the party. Lamenting that \u2018the outside world has represented the people of Uganda as people who are only concerned about the maintenance of feudalism, and as inward-looking people who care more about their tribes than about their political belief\u2019, he called for a fusion of party and state as the basis of \u2018revolutionary action\u2019.[CITATION-67] A sense of gathering urgency was manifest early in 1969 in Obote\u2019s speech to parliament\u2014widely reported on radio and in the newspapers\u2014warning that \u2018evolution\u2019 towards national unity was not possible: \u2018nation-building\u2019 demanded \u2018conscious effort and planning\u2019.[CITATION-68] The election of new party officials in mid-1969 was intended to face this challenge, but became instead a subject of scandal: rumours that the elections had been manipulated by corrupt individuals began to circulate, reaching the ears of diplomats; these were soon followed by media reports that Obote himself was pointing to malpractice within the party.[CITATION-69] In September 1969, Obote issued a \u2018message to the nation\u2019\u2014which was printed, and reported at length on the radio and in the press\u2014in which he warned that \u2018we should all, and particularly the leaders, listen attentively to the voice of the people\u2019.[CITATION-70] This concern drove what Obote and others increasingly called the \u2018Move to the Left\u2019. This began to take published form in October 1969, with the Common Man\u2019s Charter\u2014or \u2018Document Number Two of the Move to the Left\u2019. Though it was presented as a radical new statement, the Charter\u2019s core analysis of Uganda\u2019s political dilemma was an elaboration of a familiar tutelary theme: \u2018the people of Uganda must move away from the ways and mental attitudes of the colonial past, move away from the hold of tribal and other forms of factionalism\u2019. The \u2018well-to-do, the educated and the feudal elements\u2019 were likely to lead people astray, and so mass education was needed:there may be many people in this country who are either uninformed or misguided, who have not yet come to appreciate the importance of nation-building. We therefore consider it our responsibility to inform the uninformed, and to guide the misguided.[CITATION-71] Media reports emphasised Obote\u2019s view that \u2018the charter and its principles should be widely spread by the mass media. It will also be discussed by study groups and individuals in the country \u2026 The charter lays emphasis on giving people massive [] education\u2019; and that \u2018the most important thing in the charter is the necessity and desirability to give the masses some basic education on how their country is governed and the economy run\u2019.[CITATION-72] But would the party itself be a reliable tool of such education? Rumours of discontent among senior UPC figures reached the ears of diplomats in Kampala, centring on Felix Onama.[CITATION-73] At the UPC party conference in December 1969, Ugandan radio reported a speech to the conference by Nyerere that called for a \u2018decolonisation of the mind\u2019 and for \u2018changing people\u2019s way of thinking\u2019.[CITATION-74] This was followed by a closing speech from Obote which seemed to imply that politicians within the UPC itself were a problem and promised to prevent \u2018dangerous rich people\u2019 from standing in the coming elections.[CITATION-75] As the conference ended, Obote was wounded by a would-be assassin\u2014a reminder that his constant fear of conspiracy was grounded in reality, and the cue for a further wave of arrests and detentions. When he re-emerged after a period of recuperation, the rhetorical construction of the Move to the Left resumed: a statement proposing the dispossession of businesspeople of South Asian origin who did not have Ugandan citizenship was followed by the announcement of a programme of nationalisation. But elections became the central tool of the Move, which became synonymous with the call for a \u2018New Political Culture\u2019. Obote set the tone with a remark\u2014private, but evidently widely known\u2014that elections could be good for \u2018education, entertainment and the increase of people\u2019s feeling of participation\u2019.[CITATION-76] Seminars were organised by the Milton Obote Foundation, an educational charity created by the president, to stress the importance of elections, and the media began to report the discussion over possible electoral systems that had been a subject of private speculation for months.[CITATION-77] In July 1970, Document Number Five was released.Document Number Five began from the premise that adult suffrage was the basis of sovereign government. But a local politics of clientelism meant that parliament risked becoming \u2018an assembly of peace conference delegates\u2019. Instead \u2018[t]he masses must learn to accept that a member of Parliament representing a Constituency also represents the total interest and welfare of all the people of Uganda\u2019. The Document denounced the \u2018old guards\u2019 of the party, and \u2018tribal masters\u2019, declaring that the leaders of the party \u2018must be subjected to a rigorous scheme of educating themselves and the masses\u2019.[CITATION-78] Buganda was not mentioned, but the implication was obvious: overcoming feudalism was inextricably linked to reforming the party.The education needed to do this would be electoral: each parliamentary constituency would be partnered with three other constituencies from other regions of Uganda\u2014so that any Buganda constituency, for example, would be linked to three that were not in Buganda. To win the \u2018basic\u2019 seat, a candidate would also have to secure support in the other constituencies: this was the \u20183 + 1\u2019 system, and would prevent politicians from playing to a single ethnic or regional constituency.[CITATION-79] For both politicians and public the election would become \u2018Operation \u201cKnow Uganda\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-80] As a further safeguard against unsuitable candidates, however, there would also be close controls on who could stand: only party members were eligible, of course, but more than that, a new \u2018party organ\u2019\u2014free from the influence of sitting MPs\u2014would have final say over the nominations.[CITATION-81] Discussion of the proposals was itself to be part of the tutelary project: part of a campaign to \u2018educate the masses to know and understand the system\u2019.[CITATION-82] , which had now become a daily rather than a weekly newspaper, was imagined as a forum for that discussion. Opira\u2019s mission to Kitgum was only one of a number undertaken to explain Document Number Five, and the document was printed (in English) and made available for sale.[CITATION-83] An opinion piece inunder the by-line Peter Kawesa (widely assumed to be the pen-name of Akena Adoko) judged that \u2018[t]he new proposals therefore provide the basis for the transformation of our amalgam of tribes into a Nation\u2019.[CITATION-84] \u2018Seminars\u2019 to explain the document to UPC members were organised around the country by the Adult Education Centre, a body established by the Milton Obote Foundation\u2014though as one observer noted, these seminars were largely held in English and attended by the educated.[CITATION-85] Radio broadcasts were made in both English and vernacular languages\u2014though the same observer pointed out that weaknesses in translation and style made the vernacular versions very hard to understand.[CITATION-86] Academics at Makerere were encouraged to produce written commentaries to be published in.[CITATION-87] Both that newspaper and thecarried editorials and opinion pieces praising the proposals and identifying them as the focus for:political education at grassroots not only to enable the electorate to understand the machinery for the new proposals but, even more so, to understand the fundamental principles in the proposals including the philosophy of the Common Man\u2019s Charter.[CITATION-88] This rush of material coincided with the arrival of a new editor at the\u2014Ateker Ejalu, another UK-trained lawyer. A friend of Obote and previously editor of, Ejalu made his commitment to the \u2018New Political Culture\u2019 very evident.[CITATION-89] Ejalu\u2019s paper carried a piece by a \u2018Special Correspondent\u2019 calling for \u2018many more elections than we have had in the past\u2019 to \u2018educate the people at grassroot level\u2019.[CITATION-90] Coverage was not wholly uncritical. Expatriate academics at Makerere mixed polite enthusiasm for the goals of the proposals with scholarly caution over their practicability\u2014would it be possible to manage these multiple simultaneous polls across constituencies?[CITATION-91] Ugandan academic comment was less cautious. Akiiki Mujaju, a young researcher finalising what would be a doctoral thesis on the UPC at Columbia, agreed with the premise of the proposals\u2014that elections had been turned into clientelist contests and that the party was no more than a coalition of local patrons. But he doubted whether one election would be enough to entirely change the behaviour of voters and politicians: what was needed was \u2018the re-education of the educated\u2019.[CITATION-92] Okello Oculi\u2014a graduate teaching fellow in political science, lately returned from masters study at Essex University (and, incidentally, the author of a popular novel that had denounced elite abuse of power), evidently shared this scepticism over the ability of elections to re-educate the UPC\u2019s old guard: he co-authored a piece asking if the proposals gave enough power to the president.[CITATION-93] Discussion came to be focused on Document Number Five\u2019s proposals for presidential election. Obote had suggested a direct election for the president. His plan had left little to chance over the outcome of the poll\u2014the party\u2019s candidate would be unchallenged in a yes/no vote\u2014but saw the ballot as the most basic demonstration of popular legitimacy. But did that imply that the party was not supreme? In August 1970, the UPC National Executive voted to accept the parliamentary election proposals, but rejected those for the president: Uganda\u2019s president, they argued, must be chosen by the party.[CITATION-94] In an unattributed editorial,supported the decision:the Revolution must be kept on until such time it has been felt by, and has taken root in, the country. Elections can have adverse effects on the continuity of the Revolution, especially if such elections are to apply to the architect and leader of the Revolution.[CITATION-95] At a UPC delegates\u2019 conference called two weeks later to discuss the election proposals, Obote presented a hastily revised suggestion to postpone the direct presidential election, but opposition to the whole idea persisted.[CITATION-96] The press reported a speech to the conference from Ali Kirunda-Kivejinja, usually seen as one of UPC\u2019s radicals, who had taken his first degree in India in the 1950s: he opposed direct election, saying that it \u2018was the party members who understood and believed in the ideology and who must therefore choose the best among themselves to implement that ideology\u2019; \u2018revolutionary decisions\u2019 could not be subject to a \u2018plebiscite\u2019.[CITATION-97] But there were also articles supporting Obote: Otim Oryem, a UPC party official with his own reputation for radicalism, published a piece in thethat cited regional examples by listing the ruling parties of Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia and insisted on the importance of popular choice:We can only compare notes with TANU, KANU and UNIP, but in any revolution the people are important. So for the revolution to succeed, the people of Uganda as a whole must be involved, and with the way we have decided to carry out our revolution, they must have a say in the election of their leaders.[CITATION-98] The same newspaper\u2014having opposed Obote\u2019s plan in a leader four days earlier\u2014now editorialised that \u2018[w]e want a President who will speak with the entire weight of the citizens of Uganda behind him\u2019, and headlined its report of Obote\u2019s speech \u2018People must control leaders of Uganda\u2019.[CITATION-99] Okello Oculi\u2014who was working with a US researcher on \u2018political socialisation\u2019\u2014accused members of the National Executive of conspiring to isolate Obote from the people by refusing elections, and explicitly mentioned Nkrumah\u2019s fate:Nkrumah was called many sweet names. The sweetness of the names and the noise with which they were called rose side by side with plans to betray him and to isolate him from the people.[CITATION-100] The president\u2019s proposals were rejected overwhelmingly, and Onama\u2014who rumour positioned as the archetype of the local party boss\u2014was identified in the press as a key opponent of the proposal.[CITATION-101] For the next few days media coverage was strikingly divided. On 28 Augustoffered a lengthy front-page editorial supporting the decision, offering the Soviet Union as an exemplar for a distinct version of the tutelary argument:there is a grave danger in exposing the leader of a Revolution to an election before the Revolution itself is wholly understood by the masses. In his endeavour to get himself understood and possibly popular with the voters he might be compelled to start speaking in the language that is understood by the masses and popular with the masses which might not be the language of the Revolution.[CITATION-102] But the same page quoted a letter from Makerere Students\u2019 Guild to the newspaper, declaring that direct presidential elections were crucial as an educational tool: otherwise \u2018mass participation without prior mass mobilisation and political education could endanger the revolution\u2019; and the paper also printed extracts of a letter from the Guild to Obote which declared that \u2018The very act of handling a ballot paper and voting [for] a candidate is a very important act in the life of a Common Man\u2019.[CITATION-103] The same edition published a letter accusing Kirunda-Kivejinja of seeking to \u2018minimise the supremacy of the people\u2019.[CITATION-104] The next day the paper covered Obote\u2019s final speech to the conference, reproducing\u2014without comment\u2014direct quotations that made clear his determination to overturn the decision: \u2018Dr Obote warned that if the leadership goes too fast and leaves the masses behind, the Revolution would fail\u2019 \u2026 \u201cthe masses must be involved in the Revolution\u2014and one of the mechanics of getting them involved is to have some sort of direct link with the leader of the party\u201d \u2026 \u201cAnd I am sure that I will be back here\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-105] On the same day, the newspaper printed the text of Obote\u2019s letter to the editor of[CITATION-106] Obote immediately threw his energies into a new round of UPC elections, heavily reliant on student volunteer organisers, the explicit basis for which was that the elections of 1969 had been open to \u2018favoritism\u2019.[CITATION-107] At the same time, he prepared a new memorandum, which was printed in a new edition of Document Number Five and combined\u2014somewhat tortuously\u2014the principle of supremacy of the party with a directly elected president.The public record of the next few months saw politicians, civil servants and journalists picking their way cautiously, unwilling to denounce the decision of the party conference, but also unwilling to disagree with Obote\u2019s apparent preference. More seminars to explain Document Number Five were held: Wilson Okwenje, a Makerere graduate and former diplomat to the USA, who had replaced Ali as head of the \u2018Research Section\u2019, reportedly told one seminar that the election proposals were \u2018the most exciting and sophisticated innovation\u2019 and were surely being discussed at the non-aligned summit conference being held in Lusaka.[CITATION-108] There was even a seminar for expatriate Ugandans working in Kenya; Akena Adoko was scheduled to address this, but handed over at the last moment to Okwenje.[CITATION-109] There was more insistence on the educational merits of the 1 + 3 system: Bataringaya told parliament that this would \u2018broaden the knowledge of the electorate and of the aspiring or prospective leaders about Uganda and her people\u2019, and reportedly told a seminar of civil servants that elections would be a \u2018\u201cgiant step towards liberating the minds of the people of Uganda from tribal considerations and influence in Parliament\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-110] Yet there was an undercurrent of uncertainty, or even dissent. Wanume Kibedi\u2014lawyer, and an aspiring UPC politician\u2014reportedly told one seminar that the conference decision should be respected, but also that \u2018it was important to keep the leader of the Revolution in direct contact with the masses\u2019, as party delegates might be bought off with \u2018foreign money\u2019 but \u2018the masses\u2019 could not be bought.[CITATION-111] In an issue ofthat editorialised on the virtues of the 1 + 3 system, Okello Oculi published a piece in which he questioned the very idea of elections by universal suffrage:Cannot each village, each county, each district sit down and agree on who should lead? Did not traditional Africa have mechanisms for selecting the best of each generation to be leaders of clans?\u2019[CITATION-112] His argument rehearsed the concern over popular ignorance, but drew a conclusion that looked to other international exemplars as well as the idea of a distinctive African political culture:Voters in Pakwach, in Omoro, in Busia, in Kisoro will not know which candidates has [] betrayed the country\u2019s interests in dealing with which foreign company \u2026 The voters are kept ignorant. They vote the man in. Where is the hygiene in our politics? \u2026We may be accused of showing no respect for the good judgment of the people, the common man. Our answer is that it is worse to play games and tricks with the common man. The Cubans do not have elections, but they are building one of the healthiest societies in the world today. The Chinese do not have elections and yet they are without the poverty, the rate of crime, the rate of mental illnesses and the rate of racial hatred and conflict in America today.At another seminar, Dent Ocaya-Lakidi\u2014another political scientist recently returned from masters study, in his case in Toronto\u2014reportedly cast further doubt on the value of elections: saying that \u2018irrational forces were likely to turn things back to where they were unless a deliberate attempt was made to control them\u2019. If elections were necessary to guide the people away from tribalism, they should be held only once, after which those elected should serve as a perpetually self-refreshing electoral college.[CITATION-113] This chorus of doubt was abruptly quelled in early October 1970. It was replaced by a discussion of the party elections that reaffirmed the idea that the ballot could teach both people and politicians how to pursue a genuinely national politics. As an editorial in theput it:IN CONSOLIDATING UGANDA\u2019S REVOLUTION, THERE MUST BE A SUCCESSFUL MOBILISATION AND EDUCATION OF THE MASSES AT THE GRASSROOTS. THE SUCCESS OF THE REVOLUTION WILL NOW DEPEND ON THE SUCCESS IN PARTY ORGANISATION.[CITATION-114] This coverage emphasised Obote\u2019s micro-management of the party elections, which took over two months to complete. Reports picked up and repeated Obote\u2019s assertion that this was a \u2018national occasion\u2019, and the work of the supervisors a \u2018national duty\u2019.[CITATION-115] \u2018Peter Kawesa\u2019 declared that through party elections the \u2018common man\u2019 could \u2018select as his representative the person in whom he has confidence\u2019.[CITATION-116] Some press reports began to describe the party votes as though these were themselves the national elections, others referred to them as \u2018primaries\u2019, voicing the widespread assumption that those who won the position of constituency chairman would go on to be parliamentary candidates. Okello Oculi hailed the process, and Document Number Five, as an exemplary success for Africa.[CITATION-117] Others took up the notion that Uganda was engaged in a collective electoral demonstration for a sceptical international audience: as another UK-trained lawyer-turned-Makerere academic put it, \u2018[t]he enthusiasm, the eagerness, readiness and the promptitude that animated the electorate and the elected must have staggered the British press\u2019.[CITATION-118] Meanwhile, the idea of the common man was being elaborated by others working in the \u2018Research Section\u2019, which had briefly become a sort of intellectual hub for young radicals.[CITATION-119] To be a Common Man was not just a default condition, but a set of attitudes that must be learned: as a speaker from the Research Section reportedly told school pupils, the \u2018Common Man was any law-abiding citizen who believed in the territorial sovereignty political and eventually economic independence of Uganda and contributed to the development of his country as an indivisible unit\u2019.[CITATION-120] Obote\u2019s close ally, Sam Odaka, called for \u2018mass education irrespective of age\u2019, noting the importance to the Common Man\u2019s Charter of a \u2018willingness to learn\u2019.[CITATION-121] In the wake of those party elections, Obote called for consideration of his revised presidential election proposals in a rapid series of meetings in December 1970: the party executive, followed by the National Council, then an emergency delegates\u2019 conference. Obote\u2019s careful explanation that these revisions did not conflict with the August decision, but simply provided a way to make party supremacy compatible with the sovereignty of the people, was read out in full on the radio, and published in.[CITATION-122] The proposals made presidential nomination reliant on the support of multiple constituency party branches, so that the chances of an effective challenge to Obote were vanishingly small\u2014in effect they doubled down on the premise that voting was a useful way to teach people citizenship and ensure presidential legitimacy, but only if voters were protected from unsuitable candidates. Direct press coverage of the question resumed: the president of the Makerere Students\u2019 Guild, Tumusiime Mutebile, was given space in theto write an article declaring that the rejection of Obote\u2019s proposals \u2018amounted to defranchising [] the citizens of Uganda\u2019; another academic was reported indenouncing his local party branch for issuing a statement that opposed direct elections.[CITATION-123] In advance of the meetings bothand therepeatedly carried editorials that endorsed the new proposals.[CITATION-124] reminded its readers of the gaze of an international audience suspicious of one-party rule:We say we are going to be a one-party state. It is on this note that we want to prove to the entire world that democracy does not only exist where a government of a country is based on a mass of parties [] but that democracy, and for that matter undiluted, can very well exist in a one-party state.[CITATION-125] Okello Oculi, meanwhile, returned to the tutelary theme. The \u2018educated urban elite\u2019 might seek to mislead and divide people, but elections would provide the opportunity for a \u2018National Educational Programme\u2019.[CITATION-126] The conference voted unanimously in favour of the proposals. The press celebrated the decision:hailed it as evidence that \u2018[o]ur Government formed by the UPC has proved that Africans are also capable of institutional engineering and innovation\u2019 and carried an article by Okwenje celebrating the conference.[CITATION-127] Uganda was, it seemed, on the way to the tutelary elections imagined by the radical intellectuals. But little more than a month later, Obote\u2019s government was overthrown by a figure who had remained entirely uninvolved in these discussions, and who was remote from the self-conscious intellectualism of the English-language press: Idi Amin.While the discussions around Document Number Five were in full swing, two articles appeared in international journals offering radically different views of Obote\u2019s Uganda. Neogy, writing from his exile in Ghana, wrote of his bitter disappointment at the collapse into \u2018one-man rule\u2019, and derided Uganda\u2019s politicians collectively for their failure as intellectuals\u2014they were, he said, no more than \u2018adolescents\u2019.[CITATION-128] Mazrui, meanwhile, gave a lecture in Nairobi, published in a Canadian journal, which hailed Obote as a \u2018reconciliation leader\u2019, willing to listen to opponents.[CITATION-129] Each was pursuing a strategy that tells us much about these politics. Neogy sought to wound Obote by challenging his intellectuality; Mazrui to discipline his behaviour by evoking an international gaze. Both wrote in English for an imagined audience of intellectuals.The people who produced and consumed Uganda\u2019s English-language media in these years were almost all men. They were divided by many things. Their divergent regional and sectarian affiliations were a constant topic of explicit concern. But they were split also by level of education; by age; and by where they had studied. Those with higher degrees or study experience in the UK or USA found ways to express their sense of higher status; just as others found ways to question \u2018foreign\u2019 ideas. There were also institutional lines of difference, though these were more readily crossed: between party worker, elected politician and civil servant; between those who worked in the Research Section and the intelligence service and others. Yet, divided as they were by experience and rivalry, this group shared a profound self-regard as educated men and an equally profound mutual suspicion. They were also united by their anxious awareness of the scrutiny of a wider world. For all of them, to write or speak for the media was to lay claim to the role of intellectual.That claim involved a risk. Their awareness of the fragility of state authority and their mutual suspicion gave members of this elite an authoritarian reflex, based on the belief that where the masses were ignorant, the educated were dangerous. To write or speak was to risk arrest. Yet no one quite knew the rules, or the limits of discussion. British diplomats, struggling to follow events in 1970, decided that in some way Obote was somehow orchestrating the whole process, but the evidence (and more expert analysis) suggested otherwise.[CITATION-130] As one of those involved at the time later reflected, this was a time when no one knew \u2018what was right to do, and what was wrong\u2019.[CITATION-131] There was no single censor, and decisions could be erratic: this was a state that arrested the editor of the wrong newspaper and allowed the distribution of a publication that was allegedly seditious, and where journalists and editors faced tricky decisions on how to report the president\u2019s public rebuff by his own party.In writing and speaking about Document Number Five, these intellectuals pursued projects of personal and factional advancement that ran along and across their multiple divisions\u2014making judgements about what could be said, and how; but also seeking to change the possibilities of speech. They were self-consciously global, assertive and innovative, rather than imitative. African authenticity; revolutionary rigour; liberal political philosophy\u2014all could be evoked. Even as they spoke and wrote, their silences ruled out other possibilities. That Uganda should be the \u2018nation\u2019 could not be questioned, nor could the assumption that the people required education to overcome ethnic and sectarian sentiment. Rivalrous as they were, Uganda\u2019s intellectuals were engaged in a collective affirmation of a shared understanding of national politics: that the public lacked knowledge and were therefore vulnerable to manipulation; that the educated possessed knowledge but were prone to corrupt self-interest. Both visionary and stilted, their public statements cast Uganda as a nation of the future, achievable only by the triumph of education over ignorance, but in danger from the perfidy of the very elite who imagined that future.Brief and constrained as it was, this discussion left a legacy. Its presumptions shaped a reactive resentment that lent initial popularity to Amin: the coup might be seen as the come-uppance for those who had so easily fallen into things. Yet the intellectuals\u2019 sense of self was enduring. A few of those who had made themselves prominent did not survive Amin\u2019s rule\u2014Picho Ali and Otim Oryem both vanished, presumably murdered; others went into semi-permanent exile. But many of the intellectuals who were part of this debate were to be central to Uganda\u2019s later public life. Obote himself returned after Amin\u2019s fall, notoriously; but so did others. One of the student leaders who voiced support for Obote became Uganda\u2019s prime minister; another became governor of the Bank of Uganda. The radical young student who mocked Picho Ali in a letter towent on to be first deputy prime minister; Adoko\u2019s deputy returned to government in 1980, as did Okwenje.But the most significant legacy is an idea. The belief that the task of governing Uganda is fundamentally a tutelary one\u2014that a people lacking knowledge must be taught their citizenship, that the educated can be dangerous, that the true intellectual must use their learning for nation-building\u2014has endured.[CITATION-132] It has lain at the heart of the political programme of Yoweri Museveni, who has been president of Uganda since 1986: and who, as a young man, spent a few crucial months after leaving university working in the Research Section, reading the international press and pursuing student politics.[CITATION-133] "

    "title": "\u2018The True Physicians Here are the Padres\u2019: British Christian Army Chaplains and the Liberation of Bergen-Belsen*",
    "author": "Robert Thompson",
    "date": "17 August 2023",
    "text": "When a senior medical officer summarised the work of army chaplains in the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, he said: \u2018The true physicians here are the padres, and they are doing more good to the patients than anyone else\u2019. Chaplains, however, have been largely absent from the extensive scholarship on Belsen. Similarly, widespread interest in post-Holocaust Christian\u2013Jewish relations has ignored the accounts of those Christians who encountered the aftermath of the Holocaust in the liberation of the camps. This article shows that chaplains fulfilled a unique role at Belsen, providing pastoral care which encouraged survivors as they shared their stories. This process of listening was the first encounter of British Christian ministers with the realities of the Holocaust as experienced by its survivors. As a consequence, they differ from most contemporary British narratives of Belsen in their appreciation of the Jewishness of the experience: they largely recognised survivors as Jews and sought to understand the specific nature of Jewish suffering. Finally, this article shows that chaplains recorded their experiences and displayed a sensitive approach to survivor testimony, ensuring not only that a wider audience learned the truth of the liberation of Belsen, but that those accounts were defined by the experiences of the Jewish survivors themselves. The article concludes that the experience of Christian chaplaincy in the liberation of Belsen uncovers a singular example of Christian\u2013Jewish encounter in the aftermath of the Holocaust, one in which Christian ministers demonstrated a profound care for survivors, their identities and their stories.When the Second World War came to an end in Europe in May 1945, the Rev. David Stewart initially found himself with \u2018ample spare hours\u2019 relaxing \u2018under the trees of [an] orchard\u2019.[CITATION-1] \u2018Occasionally\u2019, Stewart later wrote, \u2018a visiting officer would talk of Buchenwald and Belsen\u2019.[CITATION-2] Both concentration camps had been liberated by Allied forces in mid-April, followed by other camps in Germany and Austria. Belsen\u2019s liberation in particular had confronted British society with stark images and descriptions of a Nazi concentration camp.[CITATION-3] Despite the rush of newsreel from the camps, Stewart\u2019s peace appeared at first to be unaffected: \u2018We listened a little sceptically\u2019, he said.[CITATION-4] Such scepticism was not to last, however, as Stewart soon encountered the reality of a liberated camp for himself, being sent on 14 May to Bergen-Belsen with 35 Casualty Clearing Station, to which he was attached as an army chaplain. Writing in July after he had left the camp, he declared that \u2018I shall tell only what I know is true \u2026 in conveying to my public the things I have seen with my eyes and heard with my ears. In short, the barest truth\u2019.[CITATION-5] Stewart committed himself to sharing what he witnessed as a chaplain with a medical unit which cared for survivors of Belsen. But in the seventy-five years since the liberation, the experiences of Christian army chaplains have been neglected and do not feature in the principal histories of Belsen.[CITATION-6] And yet, scholarship has explored different categories of liberator and witness: the medical teams, soldiers, journalists and film crews, even war artists, have all been studied for their roles at Belsen and how they responded to what they encountered there.[CITATION-7] Mark Celinscak briefly studied chaplains, not as their own category of analysis, but alongside Belsen\u2019s medical teams, as part of a group of \u2018padres, doctors, nurses, and additional medical personnel\u2019.[CITATION-8] His wider purpose was to restore understanding of the Canadian role in the liberation of Belsen, not to reveal new stories of British liberators.[CITATION-9] Chaplains were non-combatants and they had specific duties of care, distinct from the work of the medical teams. They were Christian ministers who had volunteered for war service and who confronted for the very first time the realities of the Nazi genocide of the Jews; they should not be included in the military and medical responses because their experience at Belsen and their resources for responding were very different from those of both combatants and other non-combatants. Christian army chaplains constitute a distinct category for understanding how British participants witnessed the liberation and understood the experiences of the survivors they encountered.Where historians have previously referred to the work of chaplains, they have largely focused on the role of Jewish chaplains, namely the Reverends Leslie Hardman and Isaac Levy.[CITATION-10] Both men wrote book-length memoirs of their experiences at Belsen, both became well-known members of the Anglo-Jewish community and were later appointed as rabbis of Hendon and Hampstead United synagogues respectively, and, as the large majority of survivors of Belsen were Jewish, it is appropriate that this is where historians have begun.[CITATION-11] However, at least thirty British Christian chaplains, attached to both combat and medical units, either witnessed the liberation, were involved in post-liberation care of survivors, or visited the camp at some point in the immediate aftermath.[CITATION-12] These included T.J. (Thomas James) Stretch, a Church of England priest from Fishguard in Pembrokeshire, who was one of the first chaplains to enter the camp. He was interviewed by a news reporter and wrote a short report from within Belsen itself.[CITATION-13] Michael Morrison, the Roman Catholic chaplain to 32 Casualty Clearing Station, who was at Belsen from 17 April to 27 May, wrote letters to the head of the Irish Jesuit Order in Dublin and published a book chapter about his experience.[CITATION-14] This article discusses two major accounts of chaplaincy at Belsen that have not previously been studied. John Ross was the Church of Scotland chaplain to a Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment brought in from 19 April to 24 May to support relief efforts. David Stewart, the Church of England chaplain to 35 Casualty Clearing Station, arrived later, on 14 May, and supported a hospital at Belsen until his unit was moved on 18 June. Both Ross and Stewart wrote detailed accounts of Belsen which have only recently been deposited in archives.[CITATION-15] As the Christian chaplains at Belsen have been largely neglected by historians, piecing together the evidence of their story has its challenges. Chaplains\u2019 letters have the immediacy of being written in the midst of the liberation and post-liberation care.[CITATION-16] Some post-war accounts, such as Edmund Swift\u2019s, composed as late as 1989, could be influenced by decades of post-war reflection on the events.[CITATION-17] In contrast, the reports written by Stretch and Stewart in 1945 are revealing in their immediacy, reflecting conversations with survivors and including detailed quotations, recorded soon after they occurred.[CITATION-18] Some Roman Catholic chaplains focused their care on the minority of Catholic survivors of Belsen. Others\u2014those who spent a longer period of time in the camp and prioritised pastoral care and survivor testimony\u2014were able to understand more of the Jewish survivors\u2019 experiences and were therefore better equipped to transmit these particularities when they came to respond. Language, too, was a challenge for those involved in the liberation and could have limited their understanding. But some chaplains overcame this barrier because they spoke German, while others relied on survivors as interpreters, or on the intercession of their Jewish chaplain colleagues\u2014both Hardman and Levy spoke Yiddish.By exploring what Christian chaplains did at Belsen, how they interacted with survivors and how they responded to the experience, three principal conclusions can be drawn. First, chaplains developed a particular form of pastoral care through which they encouraged survivors to share their stories of persecution. Second, as a consequence of listening to these stories, chaplains recognised and were able to articulate the Jewish identity of the majority of those they met, and understood the distinctiveness of Jewish suffering under Nazi persecution. And finally, this attention to survivors and their stories characterised how chaplains responded to the experience of witnessing the camp for themselves and how they reported on Belsen to a wider audience.Restoring Christian chaplains to the history of Belsen contributes to three critical areas of historical study. First, their pastoral care for survivors gives a new insight into an important aspect of the post-liberation rehabilitation of Belsen survivors and demonstrates how army chaplains adapted their understanding of their own responsibilities in such unique circumstances. The neglect of Belsen has been a significant omission in studies of army chaplaincy in the Second World War.[CITATION-19] Secondly, this study contributes a new understanding of Christian responses to the Holocaust, demonstrating that when Christian ministers encountered for themselves the individuals who had experienced the realities of Nazi persecution, they were more likely to comprehend the specific anti-Jewish nature of Nazi policy. Although the question of how far their understanding was disseminated is unclear, these chaplains\u2019 responses add nuance to the conclusions of historians such as Tony Kushner and Tom Lawson, who have pointed to the example of the Church of England to conclude that the revelations from the Western concentration camps did not alter British society\u2019s inability fully to appreciate the anti-Jewish nature of Nazi persecution.[CITATION-20] Finally, in analysing for the first time the written records of the chaplains themselves, this study provides new evidence of immediate post-liberation recognition of the importance of survivor testimony, challenging what David Cesarani called the \u2018myth of silence\u2019, the suggestion that survivor experience was absent from the narrative following liberation.[CITATION-21] In sharing testimony, some chaplains reveal a degree of sensitivity to some women\u2019s experiences of sexual violence during the Holocaust, for example, suggesting that some chaplains understood how Nazi persecution was experienced in distinct ways by women\u2014an aspect of the Holocaust which even in historical scholarship has only relatively recently been given due attention.[CITATION-22] As the only major Nazi concentration camp liberated by British forces, Bergen-Belsen has a particular place within the British memory of the Holocaust. This was evidenced by the prominent part played in the 2020 UK Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony by the Belsen survivor Mala Tribich and the British liberator Ian Forsyth, who shared their remembrances alongside one another.[CITATION-23] But the experiences of participants such as Christian chaplains have been left untold. It is important to restore chaplains\u2019 experiences to the historical record to enable a new understanding of both the liberation of a Nazi concentration camp and Christian responses to Jewish identity and experience in the immediate aftermath of the Holocaust.Eight days after his arrival at Belsen, T.J. Stretch was interviewed bywhile standing next to a partially filled mass grave. \u2018This morning\u2019, Stretch said, \u2018we buried over 5,000 bodies. We don\u2019t know who they are. Behind me you can see a pit which will contain another 5,000. There are two others like it in preparation\u2019.[CITATION-24] The image of chaplains standing over the graves of Belsen\u2019s victims was deeply powerful in framing the public understanding of Belsen and in associating chaplains with these mass funerals. A photograph of Michael Morrison praying over a mass grave was published on the front page of the Catholic newspaperon 4 May 1945, the paper\u2019s first reporting of the news of the camp and its liberation.[CITATION-25] John Ross was filmed saying his own prayers over a mass grave.[CITATION-26] Ross\u2019s daughters recall that a family friend saw the newsreel in Palestine, watching in the cinema with a Jerusalem audience. Surrounded by Jews, many of them seeing footage of the Holocaust\u2019s aftermath for the first time, Ross\u2019s friend jumped from his cinema seat and shouted: \u2018There\u2019s Jack!\u2019[CITATION-27] This narrative\u2014which firmly linked chaplains with burials\u2014has defined historians\u2019 assumptions about the role of chaplains at Belsen. As Mark Celinscak concluded, in the initial period of the liberation, \u2018there was not much time to complete additional tasks\u2019.[CITATION-28] Undoubtedly, in the typhus-ridden environment of newly liberated Belsen, burials were one of the most pressing of chaplains\u2019 duties. But chaplains did far more at the camp than saying prayers over mass graves. From their arrival they took responsibility for one of the relief teams\u2019 five core priorities, which had been laid out by Lieutenant Colonel Gonin, commanding officer of 11 Light Field Ambulance: \u2018To help those who lived to regain their humanity\u2019.[CITATION-29] Chaplains moved beyond what was usually expected of them in wartime and developed a particular pastoral role which focused on supporting survivors to talk, to be listened to and thus to regain their strength for the future.The roles chaplains were expected to play during the Second World War can be traced through official chaplaincy publications.[CITATION-30] The Deputy Chaplain General, Percy Middleton Brumwell, wrote in 1943 that the army chaplain was a \u2018source of inspiration and good cheer\u2019 to men in the front line. Chaplains, in his assessment, could have an impact on victory in battle because \u2018[v]ictory in the day of battle will depend on morale\u2019, something chaplains were well placed to influence through preaching and visiting men in the front line. But war was not all about morale and victory. Michael Snape has argued that in comparison with the First World War, chaplains serving between 1939 and 1945 undertook a far greater degree of \u2018personal welfare work\u2019, primarily in terms of the pastoral issues facing the men with whom they were serving.[CITATION-31] However, official publications could not prepare army chaplains for what confronted them when they entered Belsen in April and May 1945. Morrison estimated that when he arrived at Belsen on 17 April with 32 Casualty Clearing Station there were between 7,000 and 10,000 dead bodies lying out in the open or in their huts.[CITATION-32] In the report which T.J. Stretch wrote at Belsen, dated 23 April, he noted that a week after the first troops entered the camp, people were still dying and bodies were still unburied: \u2018Yesterday, I went round the camp with a Doctor who commands a Hygiene Section. We estimated that there were over 2,000 bodies lying on the ground\u2014there will be more tomorrow\u2019. He added that \u2018tomorrow, with a Roman Catholic and a Jewish chaplain I am burying over 4,000 people in a communal grave\u2019.[CITATION-33] Compared with the usual expectations of chaplains in wartime these were unprecedented responsibilities: chaplains\u2019 training provided guidance for the burial of individual, named servicemen, not mass burials of atrocity victims.[CITATION-34] Neither their prior experiences of the horrors of war nor rumours of other Nazi camps could prepare chaplains for the realities they faced at Belsen, as David Stewart\u2019s initial scepticism about reports from Belsen and Buchenwald indicated.[CITATION-35] As well as duties to the dead, however, chaplains had responsibilities to the living. Catholic chaplains exercised particular responsibilities for the Catholic former inmates they discovered at Belsen. Morrison described how in his first twelve days he buried around 13,000 dead. But \u2018[t]hose thirteen thousand took up very little of my time as two graves took five thousand each\u2019.[CITATION-36] Instead, he considered that his responsibilities to the living were of even greater significance. He anointed hundreds with holy oil.[CITATION-37] He said Mass, and before he had left Belsen he was able to report to the Jesuit authorities in Dublin that \u2018all Catholics had received Holy Communion at least once\u2019.[CITATION-38] That Morrison wrote about these things to his superiors in the Jesuit Order suggests something of how he viewed Belsen specifically through the lens of a Catholic priest: he had a special duty to ensure that Catholics received the Sacrament.Even in the midst of their other duties, pastoral care became the overriding responsibility of the chaplains at Belsen. Ross demonstrated how his clerical and pastoral responsibilities were inherently linked. An officer in Ross\u2019s regiment noted that the chaplain had established an \u2018Inquiry Bureau\u2019 which enabled survivors to begin to try and make contact with their former homes and the families from whom they had been separated.[CITATION-39] Ross emphasised, however, that this was more than simply an administrative department or post office. By acting on survivors\u2019 enquiries, Ross participated in the first urgent task facing Jews following liberation: to get \u2018back to their homes and united with friends they have left, if they can be found\u2019.[CITATION-40] The particular religious tasks of a Roman Catholic chaplain were also often conceived in pastoral terms. Herbert Welchman, the senior Roman Catholic chaplain to 8 Corps, described administering the Last Rites. He said that it \u2018was most touching to see the gratitude of these poor souls for the consolations of their religion of which they had been deprived so long\u2019.[CITATION-41] Welchman\u2019s words implied that in performing the responsibilities of a Catholic priest he was not simply fulfilling everyday religious obligations but was restoring a sense of normality for survivors, enabling practices which gave them solace and helped reclaim their identity, and thus providing care for their well-being.Edmund Swift demonstrated how, in pursuing his Roman Catholic duties, his status as a chaplain encouraged survivors to begin to tell him their personal stories. He arrived at Belsen at the end of April, and on his first day he accompanied Morrison around the camp, \u2018both of us carrying the Blessed Sacrament\u2019.[CITATION-42] Swift\u2019s first task was to find Catholic survivors and fulfil Catholic obligations; but immediately, he was drawn into conversation with survivors themselves. On arrival, a French survivor gave him DDT to allow him to enter the disease-ridden camp safely. The survivor, according to Swift:suddenly noticed that under my tunic I was wearing a stole. \u2018Oh are you a priest?\u2019 he asked in surprise. And then for fifteen to twenty minutes he gave a graphic description of the outrageous treatment they had all received and the atrocious sufferings and degradation to which they had been submitted.[CITATION-43] Similarly, for Stretch, Ross and Stewart, attention to pastoral care was a significant feature of their work at Belsen. In July 1945, when Stewart published his account of his experience, it was the doctor in command of his unit, Lieutenant Colonel A.M. Campbell, whom he asked to provide the foreword. Campbell, one of the most senior medical officers at Belsen, praised the chaplains\u2019 work at the camp: \u2018No greater tribute can be paid to their work than was uttered by one of the medical officers\u2014\u201cThe true physicians here are the padres, and they are doing more good to the patients than anyone else\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-44] Chaplains were intimately involved with the care of survivors, but they were not simply absorbed into the same work as the doctors and nurses. The doctors and nurses saved lives\u2014Campbell said that medical treatment brought survivors back to \u2018normal health and sanity\u2019\u2014but the chaplains, according to Campbell, through \u2018sympathy, kindness, and understanding\u2019, helped to give survivors \u2018the will to live\u2019.[CITATION-45] Ross summed up his duties in this way: \u2018[w]e had been trained to kill and destroy, now we were helping to save and rebuild\u2019.[CITATION-46] He gave a detailed account of the diverse work undertaken at Belsen, describing the procedure of DDT dusting; survivors \u2018waiting outside to see the Jewish padre with one of their numerous problems\u2019; burials; meals being prepared in the cookhouse and the accompanying food distribution process; washing in the bath-house; sanitary arrangements; and hospital care.[CITATION-47] He was, then, not just to be found standing over graves conducting burials or confined to one particular job in one particular area of the camp. Instead, his close involvement with so much of the relief work at Belsen enabled Ross to hold conversations with survivors. This is evidenced in the knowledge he demonstrated in his report, written soon after the war, regarding conditions in the camp; he was able to share what survivors had told him about their treatment at the hands of the SS guards, detailing \u2018some of the facts which were corroborated by many witnesses\u2019.[CITATION-48] Of all the chaplains at Belsen, David Stewart articulated at greatest length his concentrated process of committed pastoral care. Communicating with the aid of a German\u2013English dictionary and English-speaking survivors who acted as interpreters in the hospital wards, and working in collaboration with his unit\u2019s other chaplain, T.J. Davies, Stewart described his regime of care as a \u2018determination to understand the needs of the patients\u2019.[CITATION-49] In his retelling, this commenced on the patient\u2019s arrival in the hospital, with a smile and then \u2018a single [ventured] word\u2014\u201cHullo\u201d\u2019, to which the reply was \u2018a skinny hand\u2019 which reached out to his.[CITATION-50] Stewart understood his purpose as being \u2018to induce our patients to talk of their experiences and to help them to realise that they need never again fear the recurrence of those evil things\u2019.[CITATION-51] He encouraged survivors to recollect their experience and to articulate it to him, and in doing so he thought that survivors could build a connection between their life before the catastrophe and their life to come.[CITATION-52] Stewart believed that the pastoral support he offered also contributed to survivors\u2019 physical recovery. After numerous meetings and conversations with Marieka, a young Polish woman from Warsaw, conducted with the help of her English-speaking friend who served as interpreter, Stewart wrote that:One day I told Marieka\u2014\u2018If you could only straighten your legs, you could walk.\u2019 So she began to make the effort. Every day she forced her knees down, ignoring the pain, until she could do it twelve times. In a fortnight, she was able to stand. In another week she walked.[CITATION-53] The period of time cited by Stewart, and the photograph he published of Marieka with the caption \u2018Standing for the first time in four months\u2019, suggest that he was deeply involved in her care.Stewart described another of his patients as \u2018the girl who did not want to live\u2019. Her name was Magda, and when Stewart first encountered her in the hospital she would lie in bed, pretending to sleep, refusing to speak to anyone. Another survivor, Marika, who spoke English and acted as interpreter, told Stewart that it was because \u2018[s]he doesn\u2019t want to get better. She prefers to die\u2019.[CITATION-54] This seems to have emboldened Stewart, who the next day went to speak to her. He remembered the conversation:\u2018What do you want to talk with me about?\u2019\u2018I want you to tell me about yourself.\u2019\u2018There is nothing to tell. I am just a Jewess. From Hungary. My family is dead. I am alive, unfortunately. There is no one in the world to care whether I live or die. It would be better for me to die, for I think God himself has surely forgotten me.\u2019\u2018No, Magda, God has not forgotten you. And there are many who will be glad you lived.\u2019She gave a short bitter laugh.\u2018Who are they?\u2019\u2018People you will meet when you go back into the world again.\u2019\u2018But if I don\u2019t go back, I shall not meet them and how can they be glad or sorry?\u2019\u2018Well, I shall be very glad if you get better.\u2019 \u2026Bit by bit she told me about herself \u2026 I brought several other girls to see her, taking care to choose those with a cheerful nature and firm character. To my joy, one of them became her fast friend. She, too, had no relations. When I left Belsen she was convalescing rapidly.[CITATION-55] Though articulated only from his side of the conversation, by spending time with Magda, encouraging her to talk, and by being there to listen, as chaplain Stewart participated in the first stage of her recovery.At liberated Belsen chaplains therefore carried out diverse tasks which went beyond initial mass burials and which sought to provide pastoral care for survivors. This challenges the existing assumption that liberators treated survivors with \u2018shock, bewilderment, and lack of understanding\u2019.[CITATION-56] The medical teams, according to historian Johannes-Dieter Steinert, made little allowance for the emotional needs of survivors and thought little of the \u2018lifelong consequences of the recent trauma\u2019.[CITATION-57] But chaplains could respond to survivors differently. They demonstrated a level of pastoral responsibility which was concerned both with the physical recovery of survivors and also with addressing the long-term psychological impact of the trauma the survivors had experienced.It is difficult to judge the extent to which chaplains\u2019 pastoral work was a success. Nevertheless, in sharing his narrative of chaplaincy, Stewart demonstrated something of his own development in response to hearing survivors\u2019 stories. At the beginning of his report the survivors were anonymous and they were victims: \u2018the inmates were louse-ridden, emaciated and helpless. The living slept in the huts with the dead\u2019.[CITATION-58] However, by the end of his account, Stewart was demonstrating a relationship with individuals who had names, stories, relatives, a painful past, but also the possibility of a future. They were no longer anonymous victims who were all the same; now they were Hanka, Julia, Sara, Vera, Genia, Susie, Klara, Marieka, Magda, Eirena, Blanca, Anna, Guta, David. In this way, Stewart showed how, in listening to survivors\u2019 stories as a form of pastoral care, chaplains could engage with the survivors as individuals, and, in most cases, this meant they could begin to have some understanding of those survivors\u2019 Jewish identities.Contemporary narratives of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen often contained few references to Jews and Jewish experiences of persecution. Historians have explored how the context of the liberation in the last weeks before Germany\u2019s final defeat obscured knowledge of the eastern death camps such as Auschwitz. It has been suggested that Belsen was absorbed into what was already known about pre-war camps and not understood for its place within the escalation of Nazi persecution. The extent of the horrors revealed there meant that Belsen became the ultimate evidence of the evil of Nazism. The timing of its liberation close to the end of war in Europe contributed to its swift adoption as the symbol of the British role in defeating such evil.[CITATION-59] Joanne Reilly has noted that few of the soldier liberators of Belsen were able to comprehend something which was so horrific and therefore they could not understand its place within anything wider that would become known as the Holocaust.[CITATION-60] The Jewish story was neglected.Examining the experience of Belsen through the eyes of Christian army chaplains has allowed us, in the previous section of this article, to see how far the chaplains committed themselves to the pastoral care of survivors and interacted with them. Even then, Michael Morrison still referred to survivors in mass numbers. Describing the survivors he encountered when he arrived at the so-called \u2018Horror Camp\u2019, Morrison wrote that \u2018about fifty thousand people were herded\u2019 into it.[CITATION-61] But was this how all chaplains encountered the survivors of Belsen, or did others consider survivors as individuals and, specifically, as Jews? In examining how they articulated their interactions, it becomes clear that most chaplains had some understanding of the Jewish identities of Belsen\u2019s victims and the particular suffering of the Jews in Nazi Europe.Of the more than 60,000 people alive in Belsen at the time of its liberation, around two-thirds were Jews.[CITATION-62] In fact, there were more Jewish survivors of Belsen than of any other concentration camp liberated by the western Allies.[CITATION-63] Yet when British observers responded to reports of Belsen, the Jewishness of the camp, its victims and its survivors was mostly absent from the narrative.[CITATION-64] Scholars have generally agreed that for the liberators and for British society more widely, Belsen was a universal, not a Jewish, experience. Tony Kushner has argued that \u2018the ambiguities of liberalism\u2019 characterised the context in which the British conceived of the persecution of the Jews: in other words, an attitude of \u2018liberal universalism\u2019, which opposed \u2018religious/racial intolerance\u2019 but which could not comprehend \u2018Jewish\u2019, meant that the Jews were absent from British reports of Belsen.[CITATION-65] Tom Lawson has maintained that for the Church of England the ambiguities of liberalism were articulated in a Christian framework: war with Nazi Germany was a war for Christianity itself.[CITATION-66] When the concentration camps were liberated, this narrative was ultimately unaffected: the camps were evidence of Nazi anti-Christianity, not antisemitism. For example, Lawson quoted the, the leading Anglican newspaper, which in August 1945 blamed the \u2018secularisation of society\u2019 for the atrocities.[CITATION-67] When theis compared with other church newspapers, it is clear that the attitude of the Church of England was replicated across other Christian denominations. The Catholic press failed to recognise the liberation of Belsen as evidence of the persecution and attempted destruction of the Jewish people. The first report in thewas headlined \u2018Westminster Mass For German Torture Camp Victims\u2019. The article announced: \u2018There will be a Solemn Requiem Mass in Westminster Cathedral at 12 noon on Monday, April 30, for the repose of the souls of the victims who have died in German concentration camps\u2019.[CITATION-68] There was no room in this report for Jewish victims. The Mass at Westminster Cathedral was reported on the front page of the Catholicon 4 May. The paper reported that in the congregation \u2018[t]he Poles, probably the chief sufferers from Nazi cruelty were largely represented \u2026 They were mourning death and cruelty not so much to soldiers, who accepted the risks, but to men and women like themselves, whose main crime was that they resisted un-Christian domination\u2019.[CITATION-69] Catholic readers in Britain, therefore, absorbed a view of Belsen which was largely understood in national, Christian and, specifically in the Polish case, Catholic terms, without room for an understanding of antisemitism, Jews and the Final Solution.It is important to recognise, however, that historical analysis of this Christian\u2013Jewish interaction in the wake of the Holocaust has primarily focused on the accounts of those who did not witness the concentration camps for themselves. Once eyewitness testimony is integrated, these conclusions become complicated. For example, Russell Wallis\u2019s work on British prisoners of war has challenged the conclusions of Kushner and others that liberal universalism prevented the Allies from recognising the Nazi treatment of Jews. Wallis has demonstrated how those British soldiers who witnessed the persecution of the Jews at first hand, working as prisoners of war alongside Jewish forced labourers, or encountering Jews on forced marches in the latter stages of the war, for example, understood far better the particular place of Jews within Nazi ideology.[CITATION-70] Restoring chaplains to the historical record also allows us to assess the Christian response to the Holocaust in the light of the accounts of individuals who actually witnessed something of the consequences of Nazi persecution. In encountering the realities of Belsen, chaplains, as Christian ministers, were prompted to respond differently to the Jewishness of the experience. As in the case of British prisoners of war, this suggests that those non-Jews whom circumstances placed alongside Jewish survivors for sustained periods of time were able to understand more of the experiences of Jews in comparison with those who either encountered survivors only briefly or who formed a narrative from a distance. A context in which they were intimately involved in Jews\u2019 welfare enabled many chaplains firstly to identify survivors as Jews and, secondly, to understand something of the uniqueness of Jewish suffering in the Nazi catastrophe. Moreover, in recognising for themselves the Jewish experience of Belsen, chaplains wanted others to understand this too.The Jewish chaplains who witnessed Belsen, of course, could not fail to see survivors as Jews. Leslie Hardman was the first Jewish chaplain to arrive at Belsen. He wrote movingly of the first encounter between Jewish survivors and a rabbi from the liberating forces. One spoke to him in Yiddish:[A]nd I spoke to them in the same language. I don\u2019t know what I said, but my words had no more effect on them than my appearance. Then the girl pointed to the Magen David on my tunic, and they came forward cautiously, one by one, and peered. Slowly, almost reluctantly, recognition reached their tired, tormented minds.[CITATION-71] As a rabbi, identified by his Star of David and communicating in Yiddish, the common language of much of Eastern European Jewry, a Jewish chaplain was able immediately to form a powerful emotional connection with Jewish survivors. For Hardman, entering Belsen\u2014and confronting the realities he found there\u2014was an intensely Jewish experience.[CITATION-72] Christian chaplains at Belsen gained a better understanding of the victims\u2019 identities through their frequent interactions with their Jewish colleagues. Describing his first burial service, Hardman recalled standing by the graveside with a Protestant chaplain. Hardman asked his fellow chaplain whether he would like to pray first. Hardman recorded the Protestant chaplain\u2019s response:[H]e said it would be more fitting if I did so, as most of the dead were Jewish. And so, with bursting heart, the salt tears coursing down my cheeks, I said the prayers for the dead \u2026 Then the Protestant padre said his prayers, and the three of us stood with bowed, uncovered heads. As we left the grave I was still crying, and my companions, too, were deeply moved. My fellow padre turned to me, saying, \u2018There is very little I can do here. Most of the people are Jewish, and I cannot talk even with those of my faith, as I do not know the language. You are needed, you must stay.\u2019[CITATION-73] Even if this particular Protestant chaplain could not communicate in English with survivors, the experience of standing over a mass grave and witnessing his colleague\u2019s deep emotional response and spiritual connection with those still living in the camp emphasised to him that the majority of the victims and survivors of Belsen were Jews. There was no attempt to impose Christian understanding or language at this moment, only a deep and moving respect for Jewish suffering, grief and survival. It is a powerful image of Jewish\u2013Christian interaction in the stark aftermath of the Nazi catastrophe.In many more cases, Christian chaplains identified survivors of Belsen as Jews. Stretch made a real effort to try to understand who the victims of Belsen were. \u2018[W]ho are these people who have suffered so much?\u2019, he asked and then answered himself: \u2018We don\u2019t know; nobody knows\u2019. Stretch listed some of the \u2018crimes\u2019 for which the survivors had apparently been interned: listening to anti-Nazi broadcasts, speaking out \u2018against the state or against Hitler\u2019 and being \u2018underground workers in occupied countries\u2019. Others, Stretch emphasised, \u2018belonged to different races and creeds; they were Poles or Jews\u2014that was their only crime\u2019.[CITATION-74] Here, Stretch demonstrated that in the midst of his work at Belsen he was reflecting on who the victims were and why they were at Belsen. Although his conclusion displayed some universalism, he did acknowledge that, for many of Belsen\u2019s victims, it was their Jewishness which had singled them out for persecution. When John Ross first entered the camp, he encountered a group of girls who had only recently arrived at Belsen. \u2018The majority of them were Jewesses\u2019, he wrote, \u2018\u2014French, Czech, Hungarian and German\u2014who spoke several languages and were now acting as interpreters for the British\u2019.[CITATION-75] He identified survivors by nationality but before doing so emphasised their Jewishness. Later in his report he was even clearer: of those in the camp, \u2018[c]ertainly 60% at least were Jews\u2019.[CITATION-76] David Stewart was equally unequivocal: \u2018A very large proportion of the internees were Jewish, of German, Polish and Hungarian origin\u2019.[CITATION-77] Indeed, the identities of the survivors whose stories Stewart published were not anonymous: where relevant he clearly affirmed the fact of their being Jews.[CITATION-78] It has been noted, however, that Roman Catholic chaplains carried out some specifically Catholic roles at Belsen, such as administering the Last Rites to the dying. In some cases this limited Catholic chaplains\u2019 opportunities to reflect on the Jewish identities of survivors. Michael Morrison, the first Roman Catholic chaplain to enter the camp, did not mention Jews in any of his writing about the experience. In his first letter from Belsen, dated as early as 18 April, he described the victims as \u2018dead civilians\u2019. Already he was focused on his duties as a Catholic to Catholics: \u2018Administering the sacraments is very difficult as none of the people speak English and no record of religion is kept\u2019.[CITATION-79] A more detailed letter describing his work at Belsen, written on 11 May, referred to patients in the hospitals as \u2018Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Russians, French, Belgians, Dutch\u2019, and not as Jews and non-Jews.[CITATION-80] Similarly, Morrison\u2019s published account of Belsen, which appeared in 1947, made no mention of Jews. He wrote that in Camp 1, the \u2018Horror Camp\u2019, \u2018[i]t is very difficult to assess the number of Catholics but it must have been about 30%\u2019.[CITATION-81] Clearly Morrison was aware that the vast majority of victims and survivors were non-Catholics, but he did not feel any need to qualify this non-Catholicism with the word \u2018Jews\u2019. Another Catholic chaplain, Herbert Welchman, visited Belsen as early as 17 April. In his memorandum on his visit he also made no reference to Jewish victims. Instead, he spoke of Poles and French and particularly emphasised a group of Frenchmen who \u2018were overjoyed when they heard that a British Military Chaplain was coming to live in the camp and that they would be able to attend Holy Mass and the Sacraments. They proudly produced their tattered prayer books and said that they had used them daily\u2019.[CITATION-82] The challenging language barrier which Morrison experienced may have been a factor, but it is also possible that he did not make reference to the Jewish identities of the majority of Belsen victims because he was writing for a Catholic audience; perhaps he felt that it was the details about Catholics, and not Jews, which Catholic readers wanted to hear. Welchman\u2019s experience also suggests that he sensed an urgency in his own responsibilities as a Catholic priest to fellow Catholics. The introduction to, an edited collection of experiences of Catholic chaplains during the Second World War, in which Morrison\u2019s account of Belsen appeared, described Catholic chaplaincy duties narrowly as being \u2018for the specific purpose of ministering to the spiritual and moral needs of Catholic personnel in the Army\u2019.[CITATION-83] It is not surprising, then, that in the extreme circumstances of Belsen, Morrison and Welchman persisted in seeking out Catholics to whose needs they could continue to minister.However, this approach was not representative of all Catholic chaplains at Belsen. Morrison entered the camp in the very early stages, when there were Catholics dying around him. The need to administer the Last Rites and anoint the dying and the dead, in his role as spiritual caregiver, was urgent. Catholics who arrived later and spent more time in Belsen, however, did identify some victims as Jews. Vincent Fay, for example, entered Belsen on 27 April with 9 British General Hospital and was stationed there until 17 June. In letters written from the camp he described the administering of the Sacraments to Catholic survivors but he also stated of the survivors that they were \u2018of every nationality especially Poles, Russians, Czech-Slovaks and many Jews\u2019.[CITATION-84] George Galbraith, who entered Belsen with the Vatican Relief Commission in Europe, was quoted at length by thein September 1945. The editorial line again strongly emphasised the Catholic and Polish victims, especially those who had been priests. The headline was \u2018Priests\u2019 Death Roll in Horror Camps: Scottish Chaplain Reports From Belsen\u2019 and the lead read: \u2018Fr. Galbraith informs us that 80 priests, mostly Poles, died in this compound and that in Dachau 1,200 priests died, 800 of whom were Polish\u2019.[CITATION-85] Galbraith himself, who wrote of the time he spent in the hospitals at Belsen, contradicted the editorial line and emphasised that despite the national mix, most people in the camp were Jewish: \u2018The camp was cosmopolitan. Poles in large numbers, Dutch, Belgians, Italians, Czechs, Slovenes, Yugoslavs, Hungarians, Austrians, Greeks, German, French. The Jewish element predominated. 80 per cent Jews\u2019.[CITATION-86] Edmund Swift first encountered survivors of Nazi persecution at what he called the \u2018Bremen Concentration Camp\u2019 and which was most likely the Bremen-Farge sub-camp of Neuengamme. He recalled that the survivors \u2018were all Europeans, and from their response towards us appeared to be all Catholics. We anointed them all\u2019.[CITATION-87] Of Belsen, however\u2014where Swift arrived on 14 May, staying for two weeks and returning on 28 June until leaving for good on 9 August\u2014he reported that \u2018[a]mong the Belsen prisoners Jews were predominant\u2019.[CITATION-88] Swift\u2019s account also demonstrates that chaplains did not simply identify victims and survivors of Belsen as Jews but also understood something of the particular nature of the Jewish experience of Belsen. As an interesting addition to Galbraith\u2019s report for the Vatican Mission, Swift added that one of the Mission\u2019s key clerical roles was to gather information from Jewish survivors \u2018about relations and friends, and whether they were already dead or perhaps still alive but in some unknown locality\u2019. The information was collected by Vatican staff and it \u2018thus became possible for families to be reunited or at least to learn what members of the family were still alive and where they might be found\u2019.[CITATION-89] In undertaking this task, chaplains learned about the particularities of the Jewish experiences, above all the severe displacement wrought by the Nazi persecution.Other work conducted by chaplains also helped them to understand the uniqueness of the Jewish experience of Belsen and of Nazi persecution more widely. John Ross ran what he called an \u2018Interview Room\u2014answering questions, dealing with requests and complaints etc. etc. and running a kind of Post Office for those who wanted to write letters\u2019. He noted that his office was shared by a Jewish chaplain: \u2018He could speak German and most of our clients were Jews but I, of course, had to have an interpreter \u2026 We had a very fine Hungarian Jewess and her daughter of twenty working with us and she had a wonderful way of dealing with our callers\u2019.[CITATION-90] This work\u2014the interactions with Jewish survivors, the close working relationship with the Jewish chaplain and Jewish interpreters\u2014suggests that Ross had numerous opportunities to understand the Jewishness of Belsen.The Jewish chaplain with whom Ross shared an office was most probably Leslie Hardman. The latter recalled that \u2018I had been given the use of a small room which served me as an office. Here hundreds of people came to seek my help\u2019, for example in tracing lost loved ones.[CITATION-91] The sort of insights which Ross might have learned from sharing a close working environment with Hardman, who was himself dealing with so many Jewish survivors and their families, can be gleaned from a conversation Hardman reported having with other British officers in the camp. His colleagues were finding it difficult to empathise with the survivors. \u2018Be patient\u2019, Hardman advised them, \u2018these people are not just sick recovering from an illness; they have not just been pardoned for any crime or holding some political idea \u2026 They have been subjected not only to a deliberate extermination of themselves as a people, but to a disintegration of their souls\u2019.[CITATION-92] Hardman made it clear to his colleagues that this was not simply a horror camp but evidence of the Nazis\u2019 attempted destruction of the Jewish people. This was the understanding which Christian chaplains could obtain from working with their Jewish colleagues.Engaging on a pastoral level with survivors was another important way in which chaplains could understand the Jewish experience both at Belsen and earlier. Large numbers of the Jews at Belsen were survivors of the forced death marches from Auschwitz and elsewhere in the winter of 1944\u20135.[CITATION-93] They had survived many of the realities of Nazi persecution beyond the horror of Belsen itself. David Stewart wrote that \u2018[o]ne could always detect the Jewish patients by the number neatly tattooed on their forearms. This was done on their arrival at their first Concentration Camp\u2019.[CITATION-94] Although not all Jews were tattooed at Auschwitz, the majority of those with tattoos were Jewish. Stewart\u2019s reference to \u2018first\u2019 concentration camp implies some understanding of the long experience of continued, repeated, escalated persecutions enacted against the Jewish people by the Nazis and their collaborators. Belsen was not simply a detention centre for political opponents, nor was it the only camp where Jews had suffered.In one testimony Stewart told the story of a teenage boy called David. He was clearly deeply moved by his relationship with David and shared something of how the boy would \u2018sit and gaze out of the window and say nothing\u2019 on his numerous visits to Stewart\u2019s office. After reflecting on this, Stewart then said: \u2018There does not seem to be any peace for the Davids of this world\u2019.[CITATION-95] Perhaps Stewart meant that there was no peace for children on whom the horrors of war had had an impact. But is it simply a coincidence that this young Jewish boy held the name of the foundational Jewish King David? Is it possible that here Stewart was actually saying that through his experience he saw something of how there had been no peace for the Jews as a people as a whole? Perhaps, being a David himself, Stewart especially identified with him. Either way, it suggests a degree of solidarity with the survivor. Nowhere did Stewart\u2014or indeed any of the Christian chaplains studied\u2014exhibit evidence of antisemitism, use of anti-Jewish stereotypes or attempts at conversion, all things which, although not universally practised in the Church of England of the time, were nonetheless widespread.[CITATION-96] Stewart did not force his own faith on the Jews he met, nor did he minimise their experiences or seek to diminish their faith and identity. He appears to have respected them as Jews. As we have already seen, when one Jewish survivor, Magda, told him that she thought that \u2018God Himself surely has surely forgotten me\u2019, Stewart responded: \u2018No, Magda. God has not forgotten you. And there are many who will be glad you lived.\u2019[CITATION-97] T.J. Stretch, like Stewart, demonstrated some understanding of the wider Jewish experience across Europe. Rather than simply associating Belsen with Nazi persecution and Nazi persecution with Belsen, he was aware that Belsen was only part of the story. He recognised that the dead he encountered \u2018are a small portion of the great unknown number who have been systematically killed by the Nazis\u2019.[CITATION-98] Tony Kushner has noted that in contemporary accounts Belsen was often portrayed as the very worst example of Nazi atrocities\u2014Auschwitz was absent; and, particularly in the later Belsen trials, British accounts of the evidence were emphasised over and above Jewish voices.[CITATION-99] But chaplains complicate this narrative: because they interacted with survivors, they learned about what survivors had suffered, not just at Belsen but also elsewhere.Not only did chaplains gain some understanding of Jewish experiences of Nazi persecution, in some cases they were committed to communicating these experiences to a wider audience. Edmund Swift shared how one Czech Jewish woman talked to him in distressing detail about the gas chambers and crematoria of Auschwitz. One of her companions interrupted her and said: \u2018Ugh! Let us not talk about all this frightful business. It is now passed. Let us put it behind our backs and forget all about it\u2019. But the first woman replied: \u2018No my dear, we must talk about it. We must let the world know howhave been treated, and whathave been through\u2019.[CITATION-100] Swift\u2019s account of Belsen was written in 1989, decades after the events he described, but if accurately remembered, this particular anecdote illustrates both how Swift took note of Jewish experiences of persecution and that he continued, many years later, to agree with the survivors he had met: the world should know how \u2018they\u2019, the Jews, had been treated. And unlike Swift\u2019s, Ross\u2019s account was written soon after the war. Stewart\u2019s account was published just months after he left Belsen. Stretch wrote in the camp, a week after the first Allied troops entered. Thus, survivors\u2019 Jewish identity was not just something which chaplains later considered in the context of post-war reassessment of the Christian\u2013Jewish relationship; they did so inside the camp itself as a reaction to the circumstances in which they encountered survivors themselves and, crucially, survivors\u2019 stories.The question remains, then, as to why Christian chaplains responded so differently from other eyewitnesses at Belsen in their understanding of something of the Jewish experience of the camp. Joanne Reilly has claimed that for the liberators, Belsen was \u2018not a particularly Jewish tragedy but a human one\u2019.[CITATION-101] The very fact of being present at Belsen, therefore, was not enough to convince liberators of the Jewishness of the majority of the victims and survivors. There appears to have been something more specific about the role of the chaplain, which means that many of them did not conform to the established British narrative of Belsen as a universalist horror. The distinctions between chaplains\u2019 accounts suggest that there was no simple Catholic/Protestant divide to explain differences in reporting. On a personal level, it was what chaplains did in practice\u2014and how they thought about their presence at the camp at the time and afterwards\u2014which enabled them to recognise the Jewishness of survivors. Because chaplains approached survivors as individuals and listened as survivors bore witness, they had the opportunity to understand them as Jewish victims and as Jewish survivors.Tony Kushner has said that the silence of some when it came to the Jewishness of survivors was \u2018not accidental\u2019.[CITATION-102] If this omission was deliberate, then stating the Jewishness of survivors was not accidental either. Chaplains chose to articulate and to seek to understand the Jewishness of those they met because they saw survivors as people with individual stories. Indeed, they told others about survivors\u2019 identities because they wanted others to learn. In expressing his reasons for recording his experience at Belsen, John Ross wrote that he hoped to \u2018awaken and keep alive our sympathy for all, Jews and Gentiles alike, who have suffered during this war and before it, immeasurably more than we have\u2019.[CITATION-103] Ross stated that there are lessons for everyone, but he singled out Jews for particular mention because his experience at Belsen taught him something of the uniqueness of Jewish suffering under the Nazis and the necessity of \u2018our\u2019 sympathy. For Ross, identifying victims of Belsen as Jews was not just a matter of telling something of the truthful reality of the experience. Acknowledging that victims were Jews should lead to a response: it motivated sympathy and inspired a change in the Christian attitude towards Jews. It also shaped how chaplains wrote about their experience in order to help others understand what they had witnessed.At the beginning of his report on Belsen, T.J. Stretch reflected on how, and whether, he ought to tell others of the experience:I don\u2019t know whether I ought to write this. Something seemed to tell me that many may say it is a flight of my imagination; others may say that at least there is a semblance of truth in what I write, but that I have laid on the colours much too thickly. But for all that, I feel it ought to be done \u2026 This is so ghastly a story that the whole world should know about it.[CITATION-104] Though they found it difficult, it was in writing that chaplains first felt able to articulate their response to Belsen. They were concerned to tell the truth of the camp, what they knew of its history and the conditions for its inmates, and, most interestingly, some chaplains shared the testimony of survivors themselves. In so doing, chaplains at Belsen provide a powerful corrective to the claim that \u2018no one was interested in the testimony of the survivors\u2019 and considerably supplement more recent work on those who sought to preserve the stories of those who had survived Belsen.[CITATION-105] Chaplains recorded their encounters with survivors and these interactions formed the basis of their response to Belsen in the initial period following the camp\u2019s liberation.Chaplains\u2019 first justification for writing concerned the imperative of telling the truth. When Stretch wrote his report, he signed and dated it \u2018T.J. Stretch C.F. [Chaplain to the Forces], Belsen Camp, April 221945\u2019 in an effort to establish the authenticity of his account.[CITATION-106] Just days after the camp was liberated Stretch was eager to state the truth of what he had witnessed, and his effort to record this truth was reinforced by what he did with the report. Stretch did not write for his family or friends; he wrote for a wider audience. The report was dictated to his batman and several copies were made. One was sent to Stretch\u2019s superior, the Assistant Chaplain General, John William Jackson Steele, who, recognising the importance of Stretch\u2019s account, sent it on 2 May, along with a report by the Jewish Chaplain Isaac Levy, to all senior chaplains. Indeed, in his memorandum which accompanied Stretch\u2019s and Levy\u2019s accounts, Steele\u2014who himself visited Belsen\u2014also acknowledged the importance of telling the truth of Belsen: \u2018As it was impossible to arrange for all chaplains to see this camp, these two papers may give you the atmosphere of an eye witness account \u2026 I hope it will allow you to judge the accounts that have appeared in the newspapers and to appreciate their true worth\u2019.[CITATION-107] In this way, Stretch\u2019s response was circulated, read and absorbed, alongside a Jewish account, by other Christian clergy serving in the British armed forces. At least one such chaplain, Bryan Isaac, kept his copy of Stretch\u2019s report for the rest of his life.[CITATION-108] Even more than this, Stretch\u2019s report reached a still larger audience because it was sent to theand was quickly published in this mainstream Christian newspaper later in May 1945.[CITATION-109] Part of Stretch\u2019s intention was therefore not just to tell the truth but also to ensure that the Church at large\u2014and Christians\u2014would know what he had witnessed.Similarly, David Stewart articulated his sense of purpose in telling others the truth about the experience of Belsen. His account was written just a few weeks after leaving the camp. The report was published as a pamphlet and included a number of his own photographs. In his opening reflection, Stewart outlined his objective, writing that the experiences of the survivors he met \u2018entered so deeply into my soul that forever I cannot forget\u2019 and that in the account that followed \u2018I have tried to draw a picture of what I know to be the truth\u2019.[CITATION-110] John Ross, too, commented on his need to inform others. In his report, he recalled writing home to his family when the \u2018Horror Camp\u2019 was burned on 21 May 1945.[CITATION-111] In all these examples there is a clear sense that these chaplains recognised the importance of telling others about their experience in the immediate aftermath. Neither Stretch nor Stewart nor Ross wrote about the rest of their war service. Belsen had such an impact on them that it was this alone that they felt others needed to understand.It is important, then, to consider what truths the chaplains wanted others to hear. Dramatic, horrific details were not absent from the narratives they told. In the early part of his account, Stewart wrote: \u2018There is a shocking ugliness in the thin whimpering of a man who is longing for the relief which death alone can give; the gasping screams of a woman in the throes of dysenteric cramps \u2026 At Belsen, these things were a commonplace\u2019.[CITATION-112] Examples of potentially sensationalised language in Stewart\u2019s account are, however, almost always instances where he was describing the early days of the liberation, something he himself did not witness, since he arrived at Belsen on 14 May. Where his account is impersonal or graphic in tone, this reflects the observations of others. His accounts of his own experiences are far more personal, and his encounters with survivors displayed a deep sense of respect, such as his response to a non-Jewish Polish patient who wept at the realisation that she would never see her mother again. To this, Stewart wrote: \u2018What could one say in the face of such grief as that? Here was sacred ground\u2019.[CITATION-113] Even if the horrors were occasionally voiced, most chaplains\u2019 accounts of Belsen were not sensationalised or overly dramatised but were attempts to establish a factual record. Edmund Swift used fifteen pages to outline its location, the story of the liberation and the conditions which survivors experienced, writing for example of the \u2018half a litre per day\u2019 of soup to which inmates were restricted.[CITATION-114] As chaplains to the hospitals, Swift and Fay were particularly determined that their readers should understand the conditions which patients experienced.[CITATION-115] In his report, Ross took his readers with him as he described the camp, writing, for example: \u2018In order to give you some idea of what the camp itself was like, I am going to ask you to visit it with me now. We enter through the administrative block at the main entrance.\u2019[CITATION-116] Similarly, Stretch shared details of the survivors he met, including their ages and insights into their experience, noting, for example, that a \u2018girl who spoke to me had been there for six months; she had been in another camp for six months and before that, in prison for one year\u2019. He directed readers\u2019 attention beyond Belsen to other camps, writing that \u2018some internees say it is not the worst camp by any stretch of imagination\u2019, thus broadening the understanding of readers back home that Nazi persecution was about more than the horrors of Belsen. The way Stretch wrote was also deeply affecting, addressing his readers directly and involving them in responding to Belsen: \u2018Can you imagine your children living in such surroundings?\u2019, he asked.[CITATION-117] His account was not merely descriptive; he shared the details with an intention to initiate a response from others, just as he, too, had been forced to respond.Stretch\u2019s report was designed for immediate consumption and was therefore short. Other chaplains were able to say far more about the individuals they encountered in Belsen. Indeed, they used their responses to share the testimonies of survivors. Of the sixty-eight pages Swift wrote about Belsen, he used almost twenty to record stories from his many conversations with survivors, such as a Jewish woman who described the process of selection at Auschwitz and the murders of children.[CITATION-118] Swift indicated clearly to the reader that what he knew of Belsen and other evidence was founded on what survivors had told him. For example, he related information regarding German burials of victims in the last few days before the liberation based \u2018[o]n the testimony of a survivor\u2019.[CITATION-119] The value of survivor testimony in conveying the lived realities of Belsen was also recognised by another chaplain, Daniel Cummings. Cummings did not visit Belsen itself, but as a Catholic chaplain to a British military hospital in Bassum, around seventy miles from Belsen, he met many survivors who had been transferred there from the camp. With a knowledge of German, Cummings was able to act as interpreter between patients and the medical staff, in this way encountering and hearing the stories of many survivors.[CITATION-120] For example, the story of a young teenage boy called David affected Cummings in particular. He shared what David told him about his experience: of the German invasion of Poland, the arrival of troops at his village, the rounding up of Jews, the murder of David\u2019s mother and sister, his forced labour in mines, his escape, recapture, evasion of an execution squad, and eventually his liberation by the British. Cummings also noted that the Nazis \u2018gave him a number as his name\u2014it was tattooed on his upper arm. He pulled up his shirtsleeve and showed me the light blue figures marked clearly on his skin. Why had they done this to a Jewish child?\u2019[CITATION-121] In sharing David\u2019s testimony, Cummings confirmed his commitment to replacing a number with a name and a story, restoring identity where it had previously been erased.As I argued earlier, David Stewart moved from an anonymised description of survivors towards sharing individual stories. Twenty-nine of the fifty-eight pages Stewart wrote were dedicated entirely to individual survivors\u2019 testimonies. Most of these accounts were told in the survivors\u2019 own words as they had related them to Stewart in the course of his pastoral care, and they were accompanied by photographs of the respective survivors, not horror images of masses of anonymised victims but named and captioned portraits. For example, alongside a photograph of four young women, arms around each other, he shared the story of \u2018four sisters\u2019: Blanka, Irena, Magda and Anna, all Hungarian Jews. Stewart shared what they told him of their deportation to Auschwitz, the selections, the murders by gas and the operations of the crematoria, but he also included small facts about their lives before the war which could only have been revealed from personal attention to the detail of their conversations: \u2018Their father had a big drapery business in Hungary. Blanka\u2019s husband was an officer in the Hungarian Army\u2019.[CITATION-122] He also related small aspects of his relationship with them in the passing on of their testimony:The last time I saw the four sisters, they were all recovered from typhus and sharing a room in Camp 3. They were happy, for they had just received news that their father and brother were alive. Blanka\u2019s husband was safe, too. They gave me Vienna sausage and sauerkraut, and cold tea, and we ate together.[CITATION-123] The act of listening to survivors\u2019 testimonies and recording them was therefore evidence of an expansive approach to survivor care, in which food and fellowship were shared between chaplain and survivors, as well as stories of the past and hopes for the future. They revealed something of the individual experiences of survivors and some of the truth of the Holocaust, but they also emerged directly from Stewart\u2019s attention to pastoral care. He wrote:That they suffered degradation and indignity is no fault of theirs. It leaves no taint or stigma upon them. The stigma will be ours, who have the power to set them again on their feet, if we fail in our duty to do them this simple service. They have earned their future. Let it be our pleasure and our happiness to ensure that that future holds nothing for them but peace and rest.[CITATION-124] His intention was to ensure that society at large would co-operate with him in guaranteeing a better future for survivors who had suffered so much. Highlighting lived experiences through the recording of testimony was a way to illuminate this duty to a wider audience.In doing so, Stewart was particularly attentive to women\u2019s testimony, sharing details of the sexual violence to which women were often subjected during the Holocaust. For example, an English-speaking woman whom Stewart referred to as \u2018Madame B\u2019 related stories of exploitation at Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp:\u2018No woman was really safe\u2019, she said, \u2018I have been there when an S.S. man has come into the hut and looked around speculatively. I have heard him say, \u201cYou, and you, and you \u2026 come on. Get yourselves washed, the soldiers are waiting.\u201d These girls had to go \u2026 They had to submit to the most beastly usage.\u2019[CITATION-125] It is possible that in a different context such horrific details could have been used in a sensationalist way, to prove the horror and the evil of the Nazi regime. But in the context of Stewart\u2019s pastoral care, and his intention of bearing witness to the truth of what was experienced by the victims of Nazism, he seems to have shared these details in order to give voice to real experiences of women under Nazi persecution. These stories were shared in the words of the survivors themselves, just weeks after they were first spoken to Stewart. The conveying of such testimony by Stewart complicates historians\u2019 existing assumptions that people did not listen to the specifically gendered experiences of women during the Holocaust.[CITATION-126] Just weeks after the liberation, it is clear that a male chaplain did engage with female survivors; he listened to the stories they told of the particular abuses they suffered because they were women as well as Jews; and he deemed these examples important enough to be written up.In Britain, according to David Cesarani, Belsen was not understood through the voiced experiences of survivors themselves, despite the willingness of some survivors to tell their stories.[CITATION-127] Studying Belsen through the accounts of chaplains shows that some of them asked questions and wanted to hear survivors\u2019 stories: chaplains recognised the value of testimonies, both with the express desire that people should know and learn from them, but also so that, in reading and listening to them, the world could safeguard the wellbeing of survivors themselves. Boaz Cohen has concluded that child testimonies collected in 1945 and 1946 in a school in the post-war Displaced Persons camp were \u2018unique \u2026 in their closeness to the events described\u2019.[CITATION-128] Yet chaplains\u2019 accounts were recorded even earlier, gathering testimony from survivors who were just beginning to speak only days and weeks after the liberation.The twenty-nine pages of survivor testimonies in Stewart\u2019s report are not the most detailed testimonies of the Holocaust. They are not recorded interviews, published memoirs or professional oral history accounts. Nevertheless, they are among the very earliest attempts to record the experiences of camp survivors. Stewart\u2019s work precedes by three months the founding of the first Jewish archive of survivor experiences in the British-occupied zone of Germany, and by twelve months the well-known and much-studied documentation work conducted among Displaced Persons by David Boder.[CITATION-129] Both during and immediately after the events of the Holocaust, Jews pursued with urgency a tradition which has been termed \u2018salvage ethnography\u2019, preserving evidence of their plight for the future.[CITATION-130] The uniqueness of Stewart\u2019s account is that he, as a non-Jew, just one month after the liberation of Belsen, recognised an urgent need to record and preserve Jewish survivors\u2019 stories as they were told to him.If most chaplains responded to their experience of Belsen by writing in the immediate aftermath, how they continued to respond later in life\u2014to what must have been the traumatic experience of their time at Belsen\u2014is more difficult to trace. Scholars of the impact of trauma in wartime suggest that it is not the fact of witnessing something particularly painful which is the trigger for trauma. More influential is the nature of the context in which pain is witnessed and later remembered by the individual.[CITATION-131] Chaplains were attached personnel, operating on their own, alongside and within but not as a permanent part of their units. Support\u2014and the opportunity to begin to process what they were encountering\u2014had to be found where it could. In the camp itself it was from each other that chaplains were first able to seek and provide support for themselves. Vincent Fay, for example, wrote home about his \u2018usual clerical visitors\u2019, Morrison and Swift.[CITATION-132] Swift wrote of the way in which chaplains met together as a group \u2018every week\u2019 to divide responsibilities, organising different hospital visit rotas, for example.[CITATION-133] In such circumstances, it is probable that chaplains shared experiences with each other and offered one another mutual support.When chaplains returned to their parishes after the Second World War, however, they were again left on their own to pursue their potentially isolating priestly vocations. T.J. Stretch was interviewed in the camp bynewsman Paul Wyand. In his memoir, Wyand wrote about the deep impact Belsen had on him, describing nightmares and admitting to never having been \u2018quite the same after Belsen\u2019.[CITATION-134] When Wyand\u2019s memoir was serialised in the national press in the late 1950s, Stretch was able to contact him and a very close friendship was renewed between the two men. Stretch\u2019s daughter believes that their friendship must have helped them both to cope with the trauma of what they had experienced.[CITATION-135] Similarly, John Ross maintained contact with several former colleagues from the camp, including one of the Jewish chaplains.[CITATION-136] Although their correspondence can no longer be traced, it can be supposed that these continued relationships, based on very specific shared experiences of witnessing the consequences of genocide, helped chaplains to process this trauma.Re-entering parish ministry after witnessing such acute human experiences at Belsen was not, however, an easy process. In 1952, David Stewart became rector of Kenchester, Bridge Sollars and Bishopstone in the diocese of Hereford, where he enjoyed happier times, such as the village celebration of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. But trauma remained a reality of life. On 9 February 1956 a five-year-old girl was knocked down and killed by a milk lorry in Bishopstone. The children with whom the girl had been playing moments before ran to the rectory, where they roused Stewart from his sick bed. The funeral was held five days later. Four days after that, Stewart himself died at home, aged sixty-six.[CITATION-137] When a reporter from thevisited Stewart in 1953 and asked him about his time at Belsen, Stewart replied, \u2018those things are best forgotten\u2019.[CITATION-138] But the chaplains did not forget Belsen and did speak about it, which is why the reporter knew enough to ask about it. Local parishioners in Herefordshire\u2014as well as in Uggeshall, Suffolk, Stewart\u2019s pre-war parish to which he first returned after the war\u2014knew of Stewart\u2019s Belsen experience. Copies of his Belsen report remain in the possession of local families to whom he gifted them after the war.[CITATION-139] Though it cannot be shown that the experiences he wrote about were disseminated far, it is clear that Stewart would not have written, published and continued to share his report unless he wanted other people, specifically Christians in local British communities, to remember.In some cases, then, chaplains did not feel able to articulate their experiences in direct conversation but still managed to pass on their message to others. Perhaps, in the case of Stewart or Stretch, they felt, as Stretch\u2019s daughter believes of her father, that they had said what they could in their written responses in the immediate aftermath.[CITATION-140] As time went on, it was more difficult to process the experience, but they had at least recorded their response. John Ross might not have spoken to his daughters about Belsen but he preserved his report. If he had not, his experience might have been lost to the historical record. As it was, chaplains\u2019 own words stand as testimony both to what they witnessed at Belsen in 1945 and to their ongoing response in subsequent decades.There is an appropriateness to this ongoing response. Throughout their time at Belsen, chaplains prioritised the welfare and the voices of survivors themselves. It is fitting then that in telling the world of their experience, chaplains spoke less about themselves and their own reaction and allowed their written accounts\u2014which did so much to share the testimony of survivors\u2014to have the final word. As Stewart concluded in his report, he was \u2018glad\u2019 to have experienced Belsen and \u2018glad beyond words I met these people\u2019. He went on to say that he would continue to hold them in his memory into the future: \u2018I hope I shall meet many of them again. My home will always be open to them\u2019.[CITATION-141] When Stretch concluded his report on Belsen, he wondered whether anyone would believe him. His response, he said, \u2018is a simple one. All I have written about I have seen. And what I have seen, I shall never forget. Never\u2019.[CITATION-142] By preserving his experience in a written record, Stretch committed himself to ensuring that others would remember too.In exploring here for the first time the experiences of Stretch and other Christian chaplains, this article has only investigated one side of the encounter between Christian and Jew in the aftermath of Belsen\u2019s liberation. Further work is ongoing to analyse critically the extent to which Jewish voices could be heard, and their experiences understood, through chaplains\u2019 own personal narrative framings. Nevertheless, this study has identified the particular part that chaplains played in the liberation of Belsen, its aftermath and British interactions with the Holocaust. It has also challenged a number of prevailing historical assumptions. Approaching Belsen through the Christian army chaplains is a different way of encountering Holocaust history. The chaplain was not victim, perpetrator or bystander. Nor does the chaplain fit easily into the unhelpful category of \u2018liberator\u2019.Chaplains responded to the Holocaust as Christians in a distinct way. Though much of the British Christian discourse about Belsen minimised or ignored the Jewish identity of most of the camp\u2019s victims, chaplains often recognised Jewish experiences at Belsen and they tried to disseminate an understanding of Jewish identity and Jewish testimony to a larger public. The fact that this article uncovers many of their writings for the first time suggests that their accounts did not have much impact on the wider Christian community, although they certainly tried. This says something about the difference between the response to Belsen of chaplains and the reactions of those Christians who relied on newsreel footage to shape their understanding. Chaplains do not overturn historians\u2019 assumptions that the \u2018liberal imagination\u2019 prevented Britain and the organised churches from understanding Jewish experiences of suffering under the Nazis. Clearly, the wider Christian discourse was different. But chaplains do nuance previous historical understanding: those Christians who witnessed Belsen for themselves identified victims and survivors as Jews and understood something of the distinctiveness of Jewish suffering during the Nazi catastrophe.Finally, they demonstrate that at the very moment of liberation and in the immediate aftermath some people recognised the urgent importance of testimony. Chaplains wanted to listen to survivors\u2019 experiences and they shared such stories both in their attempts at pastoral care and in the clear intention to ensure people learned the truth of what survivors had experienced.The meaning of Colonel Campbell\u2019s 1945 foreword to David Stewart\u2019s account of Belsen is clear: \u2018The true physicians here are the padres, and they are doing more good to the patients than anyone else\u2019.[CITATION-143] Chaplains practised a particular form of care for survivors that exhibited sensitivity to their identities and stories. By restoring knowledge of the distinct role of British Christian chaplains in the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, what Stretch and his fellow chaplains saw\u2014and the lives of the survivors they ministered to and whose testimonies they recorded\u2014can in this way, at last, not only be believed, as Stretch hoped, but be appropriately remembered as well."

    "text": "This article considers the roles of faction and connections between centre and periphery as structuring elements of local politics during the civil wars of the mid-seventeenth century. It explores these issues through an examination of Pembrokeshire in south-west Wales. Using a considerable amount of previously unexamined printed and manuscript material, it argues that established but largely ignored factional alignments informed a good deal of the political manoeuvring in the county during and after the first civil war, and that these connected to and were complicated by evolving associations with rival political coalitions at Westminster. The article pays close attention to the connections between figures among the Pembrokeshire gentry and MPs and power-brokers in Westminster. It argues that establishing fruitful links with the political centre was vital to the success of an Independent group in the county following the war\u2019s cessation and, conversely, the isolation and ultimate defeat of the Presbyterian party. The article throws new light on the origins of John Poyer\u2019s 1648 rebellion, which initiated the \u2018Second Civil War\u2019. It rejects the established narrative which characterises Poyer\u2019s revolt as borne from apolitical self-interest, arguing instead that it was the final act in a factional struggle that was at least a decade old. The piece contends that gentry faction has largely been written out of recent civil war history, but that scholars should be more attentive to its potential for influencing (although not conditioning) political and ideological alignments in the provinces.This article considers the roles of faction and connections between centre and periphery as structuring elements of local politics during the civil wars of the mid-seventeenth century. It explores these issues through an examination of Pembrokeshire in south-west Wales. Drawing on a wealth of printed and manuscript material which has been unknown to or unused by previous historians, the article argues that established but hitherto largely ignored factional alignments informed a good deal of the political manoeuvring in the county during and after the first civil war, and that these connected to and were complicated by evolving connections with rival political coalitions at Westminster. The article pays close attention to the relationships between figures from the Pembrokeshire gentry and MPs and power brokers in Westminster during the 1640s. It argues that establishing fruitful links with the political centre was vital to the success of an Independent group in the county following the war\u2019s cessation and, conversely, that the decline of such links led to the isolation and ultimate defeat of the Presbyterian party. This discussion also contributes to the developing literature on the London agent in the mid-seventeenth century, and reveals the crucial role of the local committee\u2019s \u2018solicitor\u2019 at Westminster in presenting Pembrokeshire\u2019s politics to parliament and in effecting business on behalf of his allies in the county.This analysis throws new light on many poorly understood episodes, such as the struggle over the appointment of Pembrokeshire\u2019s county committee in 1644, the contested shire election of 1646 and the battle over nominations to the sub-committee of accounts in 1647. The discussion also offers a new perspective on the origins of John Poyer\u2019s revolt in early 1648, the event which sparked off the series of risings known as the \u2018Second Civil War\u2019. The article argues that Poyer\u2019s rebellion against his former parliamentary masters did not arise simply out of self-interest as most interpretations contend.[CITATION-1] Neither does it see his rising as part of a \u2018revolt of the provinces\u2019 in which a \u2018silent majority\u2019 of essentially localist communities rebelled against the intrusions of a centralising state in their affairs.[CITATION-2] Rather, his revolt should be understood as a desperate throw of the dice by one of the most prominent members of the defeated Presbyterian faction in Pembrokeshire; it was the final act in a factional struggle that was at least a decade old.The time is ripe for revisiting the topic of centre\u2013periphery relations during the civil wars, and also for re-examining the nature and influence of factional alignments and ideological shifts across the pre- and post-war periods. The historiography of this area continues to be shaped by the legacy of revisionism. The revisionist interpretation was built partly upon the foundations of Alan Everitt\u2019s researches, which posited the locality as a discrete and self-contained theatre of political action and local knowledge.[CITATION-3] His \u2018county communities\u2019 were antithetical to the ideological mobilisations of national groups, such as the parliamentarians or Presbyterians, and were thus routinely rendered as neutralist or localist. The post-revisionist emphasis on print, mobilisation and political communication between the centre and the shires has rightly consigned such easy generalisations to the scrapheap. In their place we now have a rich literature that explores how nationally framed discourses and models of communication shaped provincial communities\u2019 political horizons and integrated England\u2019s peripheries into a \u2018shared political landscape\u2019.[CITATION-4] Exemplars of the post-revisionist approach to this subject can be found in two important recent publications. Jason Peacey and Chris Kyle\u2019s collection of essays,, provides a stimulating exploration of practices of political communication across the \u2018long seventeenth century\u2019.[CITATION-5] Richard Cust and Peter Lake\u2019s superb new study of Cheshire, meanwhile, affords a remarkably detailed and revealing portrait of the manner in which the county\u2019s local politics at the outbreak of the civil wars was shaped by a dynamic and reciprocal dialogue with the institutions of the Court and parliament, and also of the ways in which discourses of national politics produced a complex and shifting constellation of local political groupings at the outbreak of civil war.[CITATION-6] Cust and Lake\u2019s book is particularly welcome as a study which foregrounds the locality and argues for the continued salience of the county in our analyses of mid-seventeenth-century politics, albeit without the Everittian baggage of isolationism and insularity. Their study is part of a growing awareness of the need to address the \u2018near total eclipse\u2019 of local history in the wake of critiques of Everitt and the \u2018county community school\u2019 by scholars such as Ann Hughes and Clive Holmes.[CITATION-7] Recent scholarship, then, has been attentive to the need to write the locality back into our narratives of early Stuart and civil war histories, but has done so in a manner that raises some of its own interpretative and methodological problems. One of these is the effectively frictionless sense of the political that obtains between local and national contexts. The boundaries of time and distance are readily collapsed in many recent narratives as historians pursue the notion of a shared politics in which there is a \u2018break[ing] down [of the] dichotomies between \u2026 national and local affairs\u2019.[CITATION-8] As Noah Millstone has recently observed, the \u2018logic of the turn towards \u201cpublic\u201d politics and the public sphere has tempted scholars to downplay the importance of geography and geographical heterogeneity\u2019.[CITATION-9] This article looks to restore some of that heterogeneity and to suggest some of the ways in which access and communication at a distance during the civil wars presented logistical challenges which had political consequences in the locality.It is also the case that post-revisionist scholarship of political communication during the civil wars has remained a largely English phenomenon. This is partly the result of a reaction against revisionism\u2019s turn to \u2018the British Problem\u2019 as a means of locating the structural and ideological momentum to bring about a civil war for which, so it was reasoned, there was simply not enough principled division within England itself.[CITATION-10] In these discussions, Wales has been largely overlooked and it remains outside our models of political dynamics in the 1640s. The current discussion thus attempts to integrate a part of the Welsh periphery into these debates and to explore how actors within Pembrokeshire, which was particularly isolated by its parliamentarian impulses within a largely royalist territory during the first war, interacted and engaged with the political centre.It is also the case that post-revisionism\u2019s emphasis on the interconnected character of provincial politics under the early Stuarts has turned our attention away from a potentially important dynamic in some parts of the realm: the role and nature of local factionalism which was not predicated upon religious and ideological difference.[CITATION-11] I have in mind here factional divisions which emerged out of kinship associations and long-standing legal disputes and contests over local economic resources, offices and prestige. The reaction against such considerations is understandable, as factionalism was an important component of the Everittian and revisionist interpretation of this period. These scholars tended to suggest that local concerns and rivalries outweighed those of the centre, and thus civil war political alignments could be rendered merely as older factional quarrels conducted in new garb, with little attendant investment in their ideological meaning. This obviously will not do. However, it is fair to say that the current emphasis on nationally framed discourses has tended to subordinate or exclude the potential role of pre-civil war factional divisions among provincial elites in helping to structure, although by no means to determine, the textures of local gentry politics in the 1640s. This article suggests, by contrast, that we may need to integrate some of these un- or semi-politicised factional dynamics into our accounts of provincial politics in some parts of the kingdom.This article presents an example of a county in which the lines of pre-war factional division operated throughout the 1640s. Although in time these assumed a clear ideological complexion, it would be inaccurate to say that ideology produced the cleavages within gentry society from the outset. Rather, it appears that emergent civil war ideologies operated upon and informed established rivalries to produce the county\u2019s particular political configuration during the 1640s. It seems that we should be wary of the analytical dyad which posits apolitical local factionalism against politically energised national ideologies. In places such as Pembrokeshire at least, we might instead consider how modes of allegiance and ideological commitment in the 1640s emerged from, developed in dialogue with, and also operated against social and familial divisions which already existed among the political elite. Often these divisions had a degree of ideological underpinning; sometimes, however, they did not, and the latter are worth exploring as much as the former.This model, in which civil war alignments emerge out of, but are not constrained by, pre-war social divisions, operates within a dynamic dialogue of communication and connection between the locality and Westminster. The analysis presented here thus adopts and endorses the post-revisionist scholarship which has seen communication between centre and periphery as a crucial component of civil war politics. It also acknowledges the ideological dimensions which such connections helped engender in the provinces. However, this article also argues that logistical challenges and communication deficits need to be integrated more thoroughly into our understanding of the operation of political connection in this period. Distant from Westminster and at times isolated by hostile royalist forces, Pembrokeshire\u2019s connections with the centre were attenuated and sometimes difficult. This had practical consequences. It seems that parliament was relatively poorly informed about this distant outpost of its fiefdom and thus relied on a select cadre of individuals to understand it.[CITATION-12] Particularly important in this regard were the MP John White, who sat for Southwark but who hailed from Pembrokeshire, and especially the Pembrokeshire committee\u2019s agent from 1645, John Eliot. These men were key brokers of information and political knowledge both for members in parliament and for their allies in south-west Wales. They were adept at making contacts and getting things done within the corridors of Westminster and, latterly, in the New Model Army also. It was Eliot\u2019s connection to the emergent Independent\u2013Army axis which would prove crucial in securing positions of power in Pembrokeshire for his friends and allies after the end of hostilities. By contrast, the Presbyterian faction, which included Rowland Laugharne and John Poyer, was stymied and ultimately destroyed by their relative inability to make such fruitful and effective contacts at Westminster. The Second Civil War of 1648 stemmed, in part, from the incapacity of disgruntled and marginalised provincial parliamentarians like Poyer to connect with and speak to the radicalised centre. Parliament established a robust apparatus for government in ex-royalist parts of the country such as south Wales. However, the inability of some of its supporters to operate through these structures contributed to the tensions which culminated in rebellion in 1648.[CITATION-13] The article begins with a discussion of pre-war politics and the divisions among the county elite which would prove so significant for structuring the political blocs that emerged during the civil wars. It then considers the disposition of these blocs in the first years of the civil wars, which were characterised by side-changing\u2014with the exception of the steadfast parliamentarianism of Poyer and Laugharne in Pembroke. The discussion moves on to consider the deeply partisan appointment of the local parliamentary committee in 1644 and the role of the MP John White in securing the nomination of his friends and family to this body. The appointment of John Eliot as committee agent in the spring of 1645 is also considered. The subsequent section examines the deepening factional rift following the end of the civil wars and the feud between John Poyer and Captain Richard Swanley, as well as the contested county election of 1646. An analysis is then offered of the moves to disband the Presbyterian forces of Rowland Laugharne, and the growing dominance of local government by Independents which helped trigger Poyer\u2019s revolt in late 1647/early 1648. A final section offers some general conclusions about the significance of factional politics and political connection in this period.If we are to better understand Pembrokeshire\u2019s civil war experience, it is important to explore some of the pre-war divisions which troubled the county\u2019s gentry and to recognise that these were significant, although not determinative, in shaping local responses to the political convulsions of the 1640s. Current accounts have not sufficiently delineated or contextualised the county\u2019s civil war differences and their prehistory; this is understandable because these divisions are indeed obscure.[CITATION-14] The influence of these long-standing quarrels was apparent to those writing during the civil wars, however. One pamphleteer described \u2018the inveterate fewds and dissentions\u2019 of the county, for example, while another addressed the Pembrokeshire county committee in 1645 lamenting the \u2018retention of old private Star-chamber and Ludlow-grudges\u2019 which had sown discord.[CITATION-15] Unfortunately, the records of the Caroline Star Chamber and Council in the Marches of Wales have been lost, but we do have evidence to determine who was involved in these controversies. An important indication comes from a letter written by the radical preacher Hugh Peter when he was in Pembroke in April 1650. In this letter, Peter described how \u2018Sir Hugh Owen and the Lorts of this country are now good friends and firmely united, who before have spent 20,000li in law suites\u2019.[CITATION-16] This is a remarkably high figure, suggesting a long, bitter and protracted feud, and, indeed, when we look back through the local politics of the previous decade and beyond, we find a division between the Owens of Orielton and the Lorts of Stackpole to be a consistent and structuring factor. The origins of these divisions lie with the pre-war troubles of Henry Lort.The Lort family established itself from the mid-sixteenth century in the south of the county around Stackpole and St Petrox in Castlemartin hundred. The head of the family from 1613 was Henry Lort, a JP, a deputy lieutenant and someone recognised by contemporaries as \u2018a rich man\u2019.[CITATION-17] During the Personal Rule, however, he ran afoul of the authorities for his high-handed action over rights to shipwrecks near his property. In 1630\u201331 he was investigated for his activities in salvaging goods from a wreck near Bosherston.[CITATION-18] The commissioners appointed to investigate these abuses included Hugh Owen of Orielton, John Laugharne of St Brides and John Wogan of Wiston.[CITATION-19] These men were local justices who were related by marriage. They would go on to form the core of the early parliamentary party in the county, which came to also include John Poyer and Rowland Laugharne, and which was ranged against the Lorts and their allies throughout the 1640s. These commissioners were highly critical of Lort\u2019s approach to the enquiry, denouncing his failure even to appear before them.Lort was then questioned several times by the Court of High Commission in the mid-1630s, which might indicate some form of religious non-conformity, although the case at issue is unknown.[CITATION-20] More certain are accusations levelled against him about shipping grain out of the county in times of dearth and causing local depopulation.[CITATION-21] In a petition to the Privy Council in 1637, Lort maintained that the certificate alleging that he transported grain to Ireland in contravention of Council decrees was made by some Pembrokeshire JPs upon \u2018evill surmises [and] groundlesse scandalls\u2019. Lort had recently been madeof the local bench, and the JPs submitting the certificate were, he said, \u2018adversaries\u2019 driven by envy. He also mentioned that many of them were currently engaged in lawsuits against him.[CITATION-22] The Privy Council, however, acknowledged the weight of the justices\u2019 allegations, \u2018there being such appearance [of truth] \u2026 under so many of your hands to whom wee give good credite\u2019, and ordered that Lort be removed from the commission of the peace, something that would have been a grave blow to his honour and reputation.[CITATION-23] However, upon further investigation, the Lord President of Wales, the earl of Bridgewater, determined that Lort had not in fact breached recent orders concerning grain export, although he had strained their interpretation.[CITATION-24] Complaints from the county bench about local scarcity and Lort\u2019s ongoing export of grain nevertheless continued, but the Privy Council declared itself \u2018unsatisfied with this contrarity of informac[i]ons\u2019 it was receiving from distant Pembrokeshire.[CITATION-25] Such \u2018contrarity\u2019 in the information being delivered to London was to become a feature of Pembrokeshire politics for the next decade. After further investigation, the Privy Council resolved that there was, in fact, sufficient supply of corn in the county and that \u2018the certificate from the justices proceeded rather out of faction then any true reason or grounds for the same\u2019.[CITATION-26] In other words, Lort\u2019s prosecution by some of his fellow justices was malicious.Henry Lort had died by February 1641, but the evidence in all these controversies mentions the close involvement of his sons, Roger (Henry\u2019s heir), John and Sampson. These three brothers would carry on the feud with their father\u2019s local enemies after his death. The factional politics of the Personal Rule produced the Star Chamber and Ludlow lawsuits which were mentioned in the 1645 pamphlet, and, while it is not absolutely certain who Lort\u2019s principal opponents on the bench were, we can be confident that they included his adversaries on the 1631 admiralty commission: Hugh Owen, John Wogan and John Laugharne.[CITATION-27] Lort mentioned his antagonists also being opponents at law, and we know that he was involved in several lawsuits during the 1630s against Hugh Owen, and was even subjected to the ignominy of a spell in the Fleet during one action.[CITATION-28] Indeed, one suit was ordered to be heard in Herefordshire rather than Pembrokeshire in order to ensure an \u2018indifferent tryall\u2019, indicating the destabilising partisan politics involving powerful affinities which lay behind these legal battles.[CITATION-29] Lort considered these suits to be concerned with his rights and authority as lord of Castlemartin, and Owen was suspected of persuading copyholders to combine together to resist him.[CITATION-30] This was essentially a dispute over economic resources and precedence in south Pembrokeshire, and no animating ideological positions can be discerned in the evidence surrounding the cases.Pembrokeshire\u2019s political class was thus split into definite factions before the civil war. These differences had wider dimensions, however, which would become important once hostilities broke out. The wellspring of the most visible parliamentary support in the county would come initially from a group of gentlemen associated with the Devereux interest in the county. Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex, retained estates and many connections in Pembrokeshire, and his appointment as captain general of parliament\u2019s forces in 1642 seems to have helped energise his kinsmen and associates in south-west Wales, including Walter Cuny of Pembroke and St Florence, and Sir John Meyrick of Fleet.[CITATION-31] Rowland Laugharne of St Brides served in the earl\u2019s household as a young man and received his civil war commission from him.[CITATION-32] In addition, a dense web of family connections bound this group together.[CITATION-33] For example, Hugh Owen of Orielton, who represented Pembroke boroughs at the start of the Long Parliament, was Rowland Laugharne\u2019s first cousin; Rice Powell, a parliamentarian officer under Laugharne, was Walter Cuny\u2019s brother-in-law; John Wogan, the Long Parliament MP for Pembrokeshire, was Hugh Owen\u2019s first cousin. All had connections with the Devereux family before the outbreak of hostilities.Another intriguing link to emerge at the start of the 1640s was between this group and the obscure Pembroke burgess John Poyer, a glover and merchant who had once worked in the household of the Essex-supporting Meyrick family.[CITATION-34] He was also closely connected with Hugh Owen, the Lorts\u2019 principal antagonist, and was described in December 1640 as Owen\u2019s \u2018servant\u2019. Poyer himself was elected as Pembroke\u2019s mayor in October 1641 and emerged as a prominent parliamentary activist during the Irish Rebellion, which broke out shortly after he assumed office. Poyer directed several dispatches to parliament in early 1642 about his activities on their behalf in seizing suspect shipping, assisting refugees from Ireland and apprehending suspected rebels. He was clearly an active limb of the emerging parliamentary state, but Poyer was also critical of Lort associates such as Thomas ap Rice of Scotsborough, who refused to provide him with the muskets and men he needed to defend Pembroke.[CITATION-35] Even before the outbreak of hostilities, then, political fissures which followed older factional lines were emerging.The new head of the Stackpole Lorts, Roger, was also concerned by the Irish Rebellion.[CITATION-36] This was in no small measure because he had married into a family of Irish minor nobility. His wife was Hester, daughter of Francis Annesley, Baron Mountnorris, a courtier and Irish administrator who had close ties with Pembrokeshire after marrying into the Phillips family of Picton Castle.[CITATION-37] The Annesleys were an influential family and they remained an important connection for the Lorts and their Pembrokeshire allies during the 1640s.[CITATION-38] The Annesleys spent a good deal of their time in London and would assist the Lorts there. However, a more significant Lort connection at the political centre was John White, MP for Southwark. John was the brother of Griffith White of Henllan, a key associate of the Lort faction in the 1640s, who had married Roger Lort\u2019s sister, Elizabeth.[CITATION-39] John was a vociferous puritan lawyer of the Middle Temple who, importantly, had acted as legal counsel for Henry Lort in his 1630s legal battles with Hugh Owen.[CITATION-40] He was also involved in the Virginia, Dorchester and Massachusetts Bay Companies, and frequented John Davenport\u2019s radical church in Coleman Street, London.[CITATION-41] He was close to the emergent parliamentarian centres of power connected with John Pym and the anti-episcopal impulse of the early 1640s. White\u2019s fame rests on his tract of 1643,. Although his concerns were centred in London and the south-east of England, he remained interested in the spiritual welfare of his homeland. In 1630\u201331 he was involved with other members of the feoffees for impropriations in a transaction with the Pembrokeshire puritan Sir James Perrot concerning lands in Haverfordwest, with a view to supporting a godly preacher there.[CITATION-42] In, he informed the reader of the scandalous conduct of the clergy from London and the surrounding areas which formed the core of the work, but also directed him or her to consider \u2018the more miserable condition of Wales and of the north\u2019 where the pastorate was even more corrupted.[CITATION-43] His familial ties to the Lorts remained important during the war; indeed, one pamphleteer attributed the rise of Roger Lort and his allies in Pembrokeshire politics during the mid-1640s to \u2018the consanguinity and alliance most of them had with Master John White\u2019.[CITATION-44] Perhaps the most significant individual to appear among the Lort affinity in the early days of the war, however, was John Eliot of Amroth and Narberth (Pembs.). His was not a family of the first rank; in 1641 it was reckoned that John Eliot was \u2018but of small estate\u2019.[CITATION-45] Eliot was involved in a legal dispute during the 1630s over the manor and forest of Narberth, and appeared in these actions as a co-defendant with the Phillipses of Picton Castle. The Phillipses were Eliot\u2019s grandmother\u2019s family; the clan supported the Lorts during the civil wars and provided Sir Francis Annesley with his wife.[CITATION-46] Eliot was also part of the Lorts\u2019 family circle. His mother was Jane, daughter of Henry White of Henllan, which made John Eliot a cousin of the Lorts and a nephew of Griffith and John White.[CITATION-47] Roger Lort would later describe him as \u2018my wellbeloved cozen\u2019.[CITATION-48] Despite his \u2018small estate\u2019, then, Eliot was well connected, and it was probably these associations which saw him elevated to the county bench in 1639/40.[CITATION-49] This was the first appearance on the county stage of a man who was an ambitious social climber and who would become something of an adept at the emerging arts of political publicity during the 1640s.It is difficult to provide an intimate account of Pembrokeshire\u2019s responses to the national politics of 1640\u201342, as has recently been done so brilliantly for Cheshire by Richard Cust and Peter Lake.[CITATION-50] This is because we lack the kind of evidence that might help us investigate such issues. Pembrokeshire was not animated by the Protestation, which appears not to have been circulated there, and it produced no mobilisation behind the petitioning campaigns for root-and-branch reform or, conversely, the Prayer Book.[CITATION-51] This comparative silence is itself revealing, however, suggesting that, despite, or perhaps because of, the connections of both the Lorts and Sir Hugh Owen to groups which emerged as parliamentary supporters, there was not a sufficiently serious ideological rift in the county to produce much in the way of a public division on the most pressing political and religious issues of the day. It was nonetheless a divided gentry community which in the summer of 1642 received rival demands for supporting king or parliament. The composition of the commissioners nominated by parliament on 18 August 1642 to execute their militia ordinance suggests that John White may have had a significant input into the nomination process, for they included Roger Lort, Griffith White, Thomas ap Rice and John Eliot. Also nominated, however, were Arthur Owen, Sir Hugh\u2019s brother, and John Laugharne, Rowland\u2019s father, which may suggest an attempt to strike something of a balance between the county\u2019s factional groups.[CITATION-52] A notable absence was that of John Poyer, although this probably reflected his relatively lowly social position rather than any deliberate snub.After the initial flurry of activity over the Irish Rebellion in Pembrokeshire, there emerged an activist parliamentary faction centred on John Poyer and Sir Hugh Owen which had connections to the earl of Essex, and a quietist group around the Lorts and John Eliot which was associated with John White and the Annesleys. These factions were products of family ties and intermarriage, but also had deep roots in the pre-war controversies involving Henry Lort and his opponents on the county bench. It is difficult at this point to see any obvious ideological divide separating these groups. Sir Hugh Owen and John Poyer demonstrated little in the way of puritan sympathies, while Roger Lort was later characterised as a man \u2018of any principle or religion to acquire wealth\u2019.[CITATION-53] There may have been some strain of religious radicalism within the Lort family, however. We have noted that Henry Lort had been brought before the Court of High Commission in the 1630s, while his son Sampson was described later as one who supported \u2018scismatickes\u2019 and \u2018phanatickes\u2019, and is characterised by his recent biographer as \u2018an active puritan separatist sympathiser\u2019.[CITATION-54] The ties to the puritan John White are also suggestive. However, it is difficult to see the Lorts as an ideologically coherent group, particularly when they, including Sampson, emerged as active royalists in the early days of the civil war.It is unclear whether the commission of array was formally executed in the county, although there was little enthusiasm to implement the militia ordinance there either.[CITATION-55] Sir Hugh Owen, along with the Pembrokeshire MP John Wogan, had gone into the county in August 1642, presumably to enjoin obedience to the militia ordinance.[CITATION-56] However, together with Sir Richard Phillips they wrote in November 1642 to parliament\u2019s military leader in Wales, the earl of Stamford, giving a bleak assessment of the area\u2019s political disposition. They informed him that Pembrokeshire was the \u2018only [county] amongst those of Wales which standeth firm and faithful to the parliament\u2019s cause \u2026 [but] we are so much environed with ill neighbouring counties\u2019. The royalist earl of Hertford had recently summoned the county\u2019s leading gentlemen to Carmarthen to attend him; the writers had refused to go but they were uncertain about how many of their neighbours would respond. They recognised that their position was fragile, and that, while they had quartered the trained bands in Haverfordwest, Tenby and Pembroke, \u2018the only towns of consequence in this county\u2019, they could not hold the county against a determined opposition. They therefore begged for assistance from Lord General Essex, for \u2018if they plunder and reduce us, all Wales is theirs\u2019.[CITATION-57] Owen, Phillips and Wogan were right to be concerned about the county\u2019s loyalty, and effective parliamentarian support in 1642\u20133 was limited to a small group of local gentlemen. These included the future parliamentarian Major General, Rowland Laugharne and his father, John, Arthur Owen, Walter Cuny of Pembroke, the Powells of Greenhill (who included Poyer\u2019s co-rebel in 1648, Colonel Rice Powell), Devereux Wyatt of Tenby and Poyer at Pembroke.[CITATION-58] Most members of this group had ties to the Essex interest which, while reduced from its Elizabethan heights, helped nurture a nexus of familial connections and probably also sustained a moderately reformist Protestantism. While Tenby and Pembroke held out for parliament (the former only until April 1643), most of the county gentlemen, including the Lorts, John Eliot and Sir Richard Phillips, subscribed to several royalist declarations from early 1643.[CITATION-59] One contemporary later suggested that \u2018hopes of gaine and advancement was the only load stone that drew their iron into the field \u2026 to take part with the king\u2019.[CITATION-60] This group\u2019s early royalism provided ample political ammunition for John Poyer and Rowland Laugharne to use against them later. However, the military situation in the county during the first civil war was one of ebb and flow with numerous opportunities for side-changing and trimming. Indeed, it was suggested by one observer that John Eliot switched sides no less than six times.[CITATION-61] The resolute parliamentarianism of figures like Poyer and Rowland Laugharne were exceptions to the political flexibility demonstrated by most county gentlemen, particularly those who were intimates of the Lort circle.It is not this article\u2019s intention to rehearse the course of the war in Pembrokeshire.[CITATION-62] I do, however, wish to present new evidence for examining the factional configurations of the local gentry during the war, and to explore some of the connections with political developments at the centre that allow us to understand better the course of local politics down to 1649. Two important developments to consider in this respect are the arrival of Admiral Richard Swanley, who relieved the embattled Pembrokeshire parliamentarians in early 1644, and the establishing of a parliamentary committee for the county in the summer of that year.Admiral Swanley\u2019s arrival was vital in supporting the beleaguered parliamentarians at Pembroke and elsewhere, but his comet-like appearance also seems to have helped destabilise the county\u2019s political balance. Initially he greeted Poyer and Laugharne warmly and assisted them in taking royalist strongholds, such as Roger Lort\u2019s own house at Stackpole, and providing men and ammunition to reinforce Pembroke and Tenby.[CITATION-63] His decisive intervention in Pembrokeshire affairs, however, and the plaudits he gained from parliament and some of the county gentry, marginalised and angered Poyer and Laugharne, who had been holding a lonely line against the royalists. Swanley quickly became an ally of the Lorts and their circle, and his high standing in parliament\u2019s favour may have assisted them in their political rehabilitation and the marginalisation of Poyer and his associates.[CITATION-64] The basis of this alliance is unclear, although it is likely that the Lorts convinced Swanley that their earlier royalist commitments had been strategic and superficial and that their convictions had always really rested with parliament\u2019s cause. It is possible too that Swanley\u2019s puritan zeal alienated the moderate Poyer and appealed to men like Sampson Lort.[CITATION-65] Although the exact chronology is not certain, what is clear is that by early 1645 there was a profound breach between Swanley and Poyer, and that John Eliot and allies of the Lorts such as the Annesleys were lining up to voice their criticism of Pembroke\u2019s mayor for his apparently high-handed conduct during the war. We will explore this breach and its ramifications in due course.As Swanley helped to recover Pembrokeshire for parliament, so MPs\u2019 thoughts turned to the administration and government of the region. The impetus for \u2018sending committees into Pembrokeshire\u2019 came from reports provided by the Admiral of the Irish Seas, Robert Moulton, in the summer of 1644, which were communicated to the Commons by his superior in the navy, the earl of Warwick.[CITATION-66] The decision was thus made in June 1644 to associate the shires of south-west Wales into a single political and military unit run by a centrally appointed committee \u2018with like powers as in other associations\u2019.[CITATION-67] Pembrokeshire, Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire were to be united, although, as Pembrokeshire was the only county under parliament\u2019s control, it was to be the means for reducing the others to obedience. This being the case, it was decided that the committee would be composed only of Pembrokeshire men. In a positive development for the anti-Lort faction in the county, the ordinance also appointed Rowland Laugharne as Major General of all parliament\u2019s forces within the associated counties.The committee\u2019s membership has generally been seen as uncontroversial, but new evidence shows that, in fact, there was a struggle for influence and representation on this powerful body at its inception in the spring and summer of 1644. This was a tussle between the two established factional groupings in the county, and Poyer would later comment on the \u2018sinister means\u2019 used in appointing the committee.[CITATION-68] This is significant as the Pembrokeshire committee soon became a factional vehicle which would effectively exclude many of the Owen\u2013Poyer circle from county politics and rehabilitate and empower the Lorts and John Eliot. The list of members appointed by the ordinance as found in Firth and Rait\u2019s authoritativehas been generally used by historians, but it is defective. This list appears to have been taken from the nominees which appeared in thefor 10 June 1644.[CITATION-69] However, an examination of the printed original ordinance, which is dated 8 June, the day on which the ordinance was reported from committee in the Lords, reveals a shorter and more partisan set of appointments.[CITATION-70] The printed ordinance named to the Pembrokeshire committee a number of ex-royalists and their associates, including Sampson Lort, John Lort, Thomas Bowen of Trefloyne, John Eliot, Griffith White and Herbert Perrot of Haroldston.[CITATION-71] Roger Lort could not be included as he had been named as a delinquent by parliament in April 1643 for assisting the royalists.[CITATION-72] Notable omissions from the official ordinance, then, were most of the county\u2019s leading parliamentarians: Rowland Laugharne, John Poyer, Rice Powell, Arthur Owen, Sir John Meyrick, Francis Meyrick and Walter Cuny; their namesincluded on the Lords list of 10 June. These men, most with ties to the earl of Essex and all of whom had stood consistently for parliament since 1642, had effectively been \u2018frozen out\u2019 of county government.What was going on here? We are fortunate in having a hitherto unnoticed manuscript composed around 1648 which throws a good deal of light on these complex and murky events.[CITATION-73] This document appears in a group of papers associated with the Army and in particular with Henry Ireton, and it seems to have been used to understand better the origins of John Poyer\u2019s revolt in 1648.[CITATION-74] This anonymous tract is framed explicitly as an attack on Roger Lort and his circle on the local committee and so needs to be treated with caution, but several of its key points can be corroborated from other sources. The author noted that in April 1644 three members of the Commons who had ties to Pembrokeshire, Sir John Meyrick, John White and Simon Thelwall, were asked to produce a list of names of those they considered \u2018well affected\u2019 for a parliamentary committee in the county. Thelwall was MP for Denbigh but had ended up in Pembroke early in the war, where he assisted John Poyer\u2019s efforts to hold the town for parliament. In April 1644 Thelwall produced a printed account of recent military successes in the county and presented it to the Commons.[CITATION-75] The House subsequently tasked him with producing \u2018heads of such instructions, or other matters, as shall be necessary for carrying on the affairs of Pembrokeshire, to the best advantage of the parliament\u2019.[CITATION-76] He was not a local man, and perhaps because of this, the Commons grouped him with individuals who had a better knowledge of the area. Sir John Meyrick, a soldier and intimate of the earl of Essex, hailed from Monkton near Pembroke, although he served in parliament for Newcastle-under-Lyme. As discussed above, John White originally came from Henllan and was connected by marriage to the Lorts and John Eliot.The author of the anonymous manuscript tract asserted that these three men presented to the House the names of \u2018those that had stood itt out in Pembrocke & others that thay conceaved well affected\u2019, presumably meaning Poyer, Laugharne, Cuny and Rice Powell. However, of the three MPs, only John White was named to the committee for scrutinising the ordinance at its second reading on 20 May 1644.[CITATION-77] This gave him the opportunity to influence the names which were put forward to the Lords, and his guiding hand is suggested by the fact that it was White who reported amendments from the committee the following day.[CITATION-78] The anonymous author informs us that around this time Roger Lort came up to London, which he connected to the fact that \u2018there was another ordinance drawen up [and] sent to the Lords, printed and sent downe to the county by which they acted there\u2019.[CITATION-79] This is the ordinance which bears the date 8 June and which was produced by parliament\u2019s official printer, Edward Husbands, on 14 June. The author notes that this text omitted \u2018all those that constantly served the parliament in Pembroke, the only place in all Wales that had not been in the kinges power\u2019.[CITATION-80] It appears, then, that the Pembroke county committee contained in the official parliamentary printing comprised those nominated by John White\u2019s committee in the Commonsthe amendments suggested by the Lords on 10 June.[CITATION-81] The Lords\u2019 10 June list thus represents the original White nominees plus the Upper House\u2019s own additions, which included Poyer, Laugharne, Cuny, Rice Powell, Sir John Meyrick, Simon Thelwall and Arthur Owen. However, the printed ordinance, which contained none of these names, became the basis upon which the Pembrokeshire committee operated. This appears to be a remarkable instance, therefore, of an official ordinance being printed which had not, in fact, gone through the requisite stages of scrutiny and amendment in both Houses.This was a crucial development in Pembrokeshire\u2019s post-war politics. The county committee was parliament\u2019s principal local agency and had enormous discretionary powers. That it was hardwired as a partisan body from its inception, then, institutionalised and fomented the county\u2019s factional divisions which had been a feature of local politics even before the outbreak of hostilities. The committee shifted power away from the Poyer\u2013Owen\u2013Essex interest in the county, which was already in a weakened state. Sir Hugh Owen was arrested by royalists at Haverfordwest in 1642 or early 1643, imprisoned, and removed from the political scene.[CITATION-82] Another blow for this group was the death in 1644 of Pembrokeshire\u2019s MP John Wogan, a co-signatory to the letter to Stamford in November 1642, who appears to have worked closely with Owen and Poyer in establishing the parliamentarian presence in the county. Such setbacks and the absence of an engaged and active interest for the Poyer\u2013Owen group in the Commons provided the opening by which John White engineered the Lorts\u2019 revival in the county.One of the first acts of the Pembrokeshire committee was to vote for the rehabilitation of the leading ex-royalist Roger Lort (whose two brothers were committeemen). The author of the anonymous tract against Lort noted that a \u2018private informac[i]on\u2019 for clearing him of malignancy was passed by the committee and sent up to the House of Commons.[CITATION-83] On 26 July 1644 a resolution was passed by the Commons, doubtless with John White\u2019s assistance, endorsing the suggestion of the Pembrokeshire committee that \u2018Roger Lorte \u2026 be freed from all delinquency and that his estate be discharged from sequestration\u2019.[CITATION-84] The same day, the Commons also resolved to appoint Lort as a member of the county committee. Thus were the Lorts and their allies effectively placed in control of parliament\u2019s local administration, \u2018after which\u2019, claimed the anonymous author, \u2018the constant endeavours [of the Lorts and their allies] hath been the ruine of those that had faithfully served parliament\u2019.[CITATION-85] However, Roger Lort was only one of a number of new nominations to the Pembrokeshire committee suggested by the Commons on 26 July 1644. It seems that the problems with the original nomination process under the 8 June ordinance had been noticed, probably through representations from disgruntled parties in Pembrokeshire, perhaps via Thelwall or Meyrick at Westminster. The new appointments included John Laugharne, Rowland\u2019s father, as well as Arthur Owen, Sir Hugh\u2019s brother, and Lewis Barlow, Sir Hugh\u2019s brother-in-law, probably as an attempt to balance the Lort interest. However, other Lort associates were also added at this time, including Sir Richard Phillips, who had signed royalist declarations alongside the Lorts, and also Admiral Richard Swanley and his deputy Captain William Smith. As mentioned above, Swanley and Smith quickly formed an association with the Lorts and their circle, and these two men would soon emerge as implacable opponents of John Poyer.[CITATION-86] It seems that Poyer himself was too divisive a figure in county politics for his inclusion on the committee to be contemplated at this stage.As this controversial process of establishing a Pembrokeshire committee was in train, however, war returned to the county with the re-establishment of royalist control in many places under Charles Gerard. Ultimately, the two military leaders in the area, Laugharne and Swanley, were able to frustrate and then roll back these efforts, while Poyer continued to maintain his obdurate resistance at Pembroke. As the prospect of peace came into view in 1645, however, so the factional divisions in the county became increasingly bitter and destructive. In February 1645 informations against Laugharne were apparently passed on to John White by opponents in the county, although these were not acted on at this time.[CITATION-87] A key moment in this drama, however, was the appointment around February 1645 of John Eliot as \u2018agent\u2019 or \u2018solicitor\u2019 for the Pembrokeshire committee at parliament.[CITATION-88] His appointment was approved by the Lort supporters on the committee in the face of opposition from the Owen\u2013Laugharne interest. This was a crucial development, as Eliot now gained privileged access to parliament and operated as the primary conduit between parliament and Pembrokeshire.[CITATION-89] This was especially important because John White, the Lort faction\u2019s principal sponsor and supporter in parliament, died on 29 January 1645. It was perhaps his death which caused Eliot to seek the position of agent in the first place, in an attempt to maintain his circle\u2019s leverage and access at Westminster. He appears to have gone to London in May 1645.[CITATION-90] Eliot was in a particularly influential position because Pembrokeshire had no other \u2018official\u2019 voice in parliament: the county MP, John Wogan, was dead; Sir John Stepney, member for Haverfordwest, was a royalist who had been disqualified from sitting in April 1643;[CITATION-91] Sir Hugh Owen was in royalist custody. Eliot was thus the official voice of the county as representative of its committee, and largely controlled what parliament knew about Pembrokeshire and how it determined friend from foe in that part of the kingdom. The author of the manuscript tract against Roger Lort maintained that Eliot, as agent, operated \u2018under notion of serving that country\u2019 by \u2018falsely representing the endeavours of those that opposed him whilst he acted for the king\u2019 in the early 1640s. The tract also conjectured that Eliot\u2019s partisan efforts were directed either towards securing his own and his friends\u2019 positions in the machinery of parliament\u2019s administration or instead \u2018to rayse iealousy in the parliament of those that had served them\u2019 in the first war such as Poyer and Laugharne.[CITATION-92] Probably discomfited by Eliot\u2019s new role, in March 1645 John Poyer petitioned Speaker Lenthall requesting money, ammunition and other provisions, which he claimed were required to meet a renewed threat of invasion from Ireland. He emphasised how his town of Pembroke had been faithful \u2018from the beginning of this unnaturall warre\u2019, adding, \u2018I would to God the honourabll howses of parliament were truly informed of the present state of this countrey\u2019, as its strategic importance meant that any weaknesses there threatened the whole kingdom.[CITATION-93] Two days later Poyer\u2019s name appeared at the head of a petition to parliament from Pembroke town. This document again rehearsed how Pembroke had stood firm while the denizens of houses such as Stackpole and Trefloyne (the homes of Roger Lort and Thomas Bowen, respectively) \u2018tooke parte with the enemie\u2019. This had placed Pembroke in dire straits, so the petitioners requested payment of the garrison and adequate provisioning. Poyer\u2019s name was followed by a list of some 120 signatures.[CITATION-94] This was a potentially incendiary pair of petitions, as they suggested that the county committee was not doing its job of supplying and provisioning Pembroke, and, by extension, was careless of the wider security threat from Ireland.[CITATION-95] Moreover, by claiming that parliament was not \u2018truly informed\u2019 about the current state of the county, Poyer was alleging that intermediaries like John Eliot were pulling the wool over their masters\u2019 eyes.The counterblast from Poyer\u2019s enemies was swift and forthright. On 1 April 1645 the Pembrokeshire committee petitioned Lenthall themselves, describing how the \u2018publique service entrusted to our care in these parts\u2019 had \u2018suffered manifold interruptions by the insolent opposicions and insatiable oppressions of Captain John Poyer\u2019.[CITATION-96] They promised to provide parliament with a \u2018manifestac[i]on of the perticulars\u2019 of his conduct in due course, but for the moment concentrated on his supposed detention of Carew Castle from its rightful owner, their associate and ally, Sir Richard Phillips. This was, then, a clear breach between Poyer, as parliament\u2019s most visible and steadfast supporter in the area, and the county committee, which had been populated by ex-royalists and Poyer and Owen\u2019s enemies of long standing. The signatories to this petition form a roll-call of the new political order in the county, who would conduct a campaign against Poyer and his supporters for the next three years, and ultimately drive Poyer, Rice Powell and Rowland Laugharne into revolt in 1648. Prominent among them were Admiral Richard Swanley and his deputy Captain William Smith. The three Lort brothers, Roger, Sampson and John, also signed alongside their ally, the newly crowned committee agent, John Eliot. Also present were Griffith White of Henllan and Thomas Bowen of Trefloyne. A few weeks later the committee followed up with another petition which again complained of Poyer\u2019s \u2018turbulent opposicions and oppressions\u2019, claimed that he respected no local authority and consequently argued that he endangered the county\u2019s security. On this basis, they called for his \u2018immediate censure\u2019 by the Commons and had sent up articles upon which they requested that he be secured.[CITATION-97] Poyer was not arrested at this time, but signs of a response from the MPs can be seen on 26 May 1645 when the Commons received letters from both Poyer and Laugharne. Laugharne and Rice Powell had been defeated by Gerard in late April, when he drove the parliamentarians\u2019 forces back into their urban garrisons, or \u2018their last stake\u2019 as one royalist newspaper had it, raising serious concerns that the county might be lost entirely.[CITATION-98] Presumably, the letters which Poyer and Laugharne sent to parliament detailed their precarious situation and articulated pleas for assistance; this was apparently in the face of criticism of Laugharne from his opponents on the county committee.[CITATION-99] These letters were passed to the Committee of Both Kingdoms and the Navy Committee with proposals to send forces to help preserve the county for parliament. On this occasion Pembrokeshire\u2019s case was recommended to the \u2018special care\u2019 of Simon Thelwall, Poyer\u2019s erstwhile associate in defending Pembroke. Moreover, a resolution was then passed that Poyer be added to \u2018all the committees of Pembrokeshire\u2019.[CITATION-100] Although a blow, then, Laugharne\u2019s defeat probably played into the narrative Poyer established in his March petition, that the local committee\u2019s neglect was hampering the war effort and compromising parliament\u2019s security in the far west. This may have been reinforced by the fact that at the height of the fighting many of the Lorts\u2019 circle on the committee had abandoned the county and fled to London or escaped to Swanley\u2019s ships, which were then riding off the coast.[CITATION-101] The order to appoint Poyer to the committee suggests a response to such concerns, although the order for his inclusion had to be repeated in August 1645, and it seems he never actually took his place on this body.[CITATION-102] That there was a concerted fightback by Poyer, Laugharne and their allies against the Pembroke committee is suggested by the publication of a pamphlet directed to the Committee of Both Kingdoms which was timed to coincide with the submission of the two commanders\u2019 letters to that body.[CITATION-103] was published anonymously and dwelt on the strategic importance of securing Pembrokeshire in general and Milford Haven in particular. However, it also contained letters to the Pembrokeshire committee and to John Poyer from unnamed individuals who had recently left the county. They entreated the committee to \u2018cast away \u2026 your own selfishnes \u2026 which \u2026 [has] proved unto you more banefull then the malice of your most malignant enemy\u2019. They accused the committeemen of covetousness and greed, and claimed that their arbitrary proceedings and \u2018abuse of Gods ministers was the dissolution and rout of that part of your army\u2019.[CITATION-104] This reference to abusing clergymen suggests that more radical religious positions were being promoted by members of the committee, probably by men such as Sampson Lort. In the future such religious sympathies would help align the Pembrokeshire committee with the New Model Army and its Independent leaders, but this letter suggests that such positions had alienated the religious sensibilities of those fighting under Laugharne, who was a moderate Presbyterian. The pamphlet also contained a letter addressed to Poyer who was described as \u2018the most vigilant mayor of the towne of Pembroke\u2019. It praised his \u2018worth and faithfull service to the state\u2019 and enjoined him to \u2018goe on in your wonted constancy\u2019.[CITATION-105] The timing and nature of this publication suggests that it was designed to shore up Poyer and Laugharne\u2019s position in parliament and undermine the status of the committee. It was a pitch to public opinion within Westminster by the parliamentary moderates who would become the local Presbyterian party. Such a move suggests a recognition on their part of the need to use channels other than John Eliot to inform parliament and its executive committees of the situation in distant Pembrokeshire.The king\u2019s troubles in England during the latter half of 1645 drew Gerard and his royalist forces away from the Pembrokeshire theatre. This allowed Laugharne to rout the remaining royalist troops in the county with his victory at the Battle of Colby Moor on 1 August. As the curtain fell on Pembrokeshire\u2019s military struggles, however, so new fronts opened in its political battles. Laugharne himself fired an early volley with a letter to Speaker Lenthall of 13 September 1645 which reveals the profound breach that existed within the county\u2019s parliamentarian elite. In the letter, Laugharne praised Arthur Owen of Orielton, Sir Hugh\u2019s brother, for his \u2018constant integritie and resolucion of the publique\u2019. He rounded, however, on Roger Lort, who \u2018in our greatest exigencie deserted us, and in contempt of my comaunde for his staie, shipped himself for London, there, as I understand, makeinge Mr Elliott of his faction, disgorgeinge private ranckor and malice against those whose merritt will endure the teste\u2019.[CITATION-106] Laugharne was referring to Lort and Eliot\u2019s campaign against Poyer in the capital, which Eliot later portrayed as a reasonable effort to present the mayor\u2019s \u2018publick and personall abuses\u2019 to parliament.[CITATION-107] Political communication was clearly crucial in this battle for control of the county. The factional battle lines were coming into sharper focus as the end of the fighting approached, but it is worth noting that these differences were not simply the products of the war, although clearly the conflict had given them impetus and transmuted them into new forms. A lineage can clearly be traced through to the collection of gentlemen who aligned behind Owen and against the Lorts in the twilight of Personal Rule, and whose familial links had been tempered by the heat of conflict and given a keener ideological edge.One intriguing front that opened up in this confrontation between the county\u2019s emerging power blocs was an investigation into Richard Swanley\u2019s conduct as Admiral of the Irish Seas. Hearings before the Admiralty Court began in October 1645 and it soon became clear that this was another Pembrokeshire proxy war.[CITATION-108] Although John Poyer had not initiated the case, he was keen to give evidence against Swanley. Mayor Poyer had collected depositions from sailors who were willing to swear that Swanley had allowed them to trade with the enemy while he rode in Milford Haven.[CITATION-109] He also alleged that Swanley had refused to furnish him with provisions and ammunition when Pembroke was besieged by royalist forces.[CITATION-110] It was further claimed that Swanley had attempted to divide the Pembrokeshire committee from the \u2018prime gentrye\u2019 of the county. Among the deponents in this case was the agent John Eliot who, unsurprisingly, defended Swanley to the hilt, describing his demeanour as \u2018sweete and deserving the love of the well affected of the countrye\u2019. When giving evidence, however, he impugned Poyer\u2019s reputation and questioned his political reliability during the war. John Annesley, Roger Lort\u2019s brother-in-law, also supported Swanley in court, maintaining that he had heard local committeemen (probably referring to individuals such as Eliot) state that the admiral was \u2018under God the onely instrument for the regayneing of the county of Pembrooke \u2026 from the enemy\u2019.[CITATION-111] Swanley was cleared of all charges in March 1646, which prompted one parliamentary newspaper, in copy which looks as if it was probably provided by John Eliot himself, to lament how \u2018endeavours have been set on foot to blast the reputation of that unblemished, vigilant, valiant, and faithfull sea-commander\u2019.[CITATION-112] The court case had wounded Swanley and, through him, his associates on the Pembrokeshire committee. It had not seriously weakened them, however, and even as the case was being considered, they were plotting to exact their revenge.In January 1646 Swanley had Poyer arrested in London while he was there on business for Rowland Laugharne. This was, in Poyer\u2019s words, \u2018after many affronts by some gentlemen whome he had formerly forced in to the obedyence of the parlyament\u2019.[CITATION-113] In December 1645, the Lords had recommended that Poyer be allowed to recoup monies (he claimed as much as \u00a34,000) from delinquents\u2019 estates in the region.[CITATION-114] This may have concerned the Lort\u2013Eliot faction as the order cut across the county committee\u2019s jurisdiction over sequestrations, and potentially opened the way for Poyer to bring articles against some of them for their royalist pasts or look to recover funds from the estates of their friends and allies.[CITATION-115] This possibility, along with Poyer\u2019s involvement in the Admiralty case against Swanley, probably prompted his arrest. Poyer\u2019s plight was communicated to Laugharne who responded with another missive to Lenthall complaining that \u2018Mr Lorte and Mr Elliott, the committees agent, are so whollie taken with the prosecution of private malice they cane spare noe thoughts for the publique good \u2026 Captain Poyer is molested by some gentlemen [who] in our distresse were our greatest enemies and [whom] successe onlie induced to profess our frindshippe\u2019.[CITATION-116] It was against this backdrop of bitter factional infighting that parliament resolved to fill the Pembrokeshire seat left vacant by John Wogan\u2019s death in 1644. This initiative was probably promoted by Eliot and the Lorts, for on the day that parliament issued the writ for a new county election, the Commons also resolved that the Lort-supporting William Phillipps of Haythog, son of the Pembrokeshire committeeman John Phillipps of Ffynnongain, be appointed sheriff.[CITATION-117] The sheriff was the official who would control the election process, and it seems likely that the Eliot\u2013Lort circle believed that his appointment would give them a decisive advantage at the hustings. Securing the county seat, allied with Eliot\u2019s operation as committee agent in Westminster, would provide a formidable position from which to stymie enemies like Poyer and advance their own interests. They would effectively control both ends of the communication channel between Pembrokeshire and parliament. Nothing has been known about the 1646 election hitherto, but now the manuscript attack on Roger Lort drafted around 1648 offers us fresh evidence about the nature of the struggle for power in post-war Pembrokeshire.The anonymous author wrote that a decision was made to \u2018surprise the county\u2019 with the election by one \u2018whoe had served the parliament under the Earle of Essex[\u2019s] imediate comaund & [was] therby not soe well knowing what was done in that country\u2019.[CITATION-118] This seems to be a reference to the MP Sir John Meyrick who was general of the ordnance under Essex and served in several theatres of the war, but not in Wales. He was a natural ally of the Laugharne\u2013Poyer group: his mother was Anne Laugharne and Meyrick would name Rowland Laugharne as one of the overseers of his will.[CITATION-119] This close connection explains the exculpatory tone adopted in the manuscript\u2019s description of his role in events; he was painted as an unwitting instrument of a Lort deception rather than a culpable agent. The account continued that the Eliot\u2013Lort group \u2018plotted\u2019 with the sheriff to have Herbert Perrot of Haroldston elected as county member. Perrot had shadowed John Eliot and Roger Lort in their declarations for the king and in their return to the parliamentary fold, and was a trusted intimate in their circle.[CITATION-120] Despite the fact that Sheriff Phillipps held the court at an obscure location and with little warning, \u2018the countrey \u2026 came thither and there made choyce of one that was then in London & had served the parliament with his uttermost endeavours in Pembrocke during all their tyme of distres\u2019.[CITATION-121] Perrot\u2019s opponent and the man eventually elected for the county was Arthur Owen of Orielton. Sir Hugh Owen\u2019s brother, Arthur had declared early for parliament and operated with Laugharne (his cousin) in driving the royalist earl of Carbery\u2019s forces out of the county in 1643\u20134.[CITATION-122] Moreover, this was the man whom the Major General had recently praised to the Speaker for his \u2018constant integritie and resolucion of the publique\u2019.[CITATION-123] Owen was also described by Eliot as a \u2018continued friend\u2019 of John Poyer.[CITATION-124] The county election was thus something of a set-piece in the power struggle between the two familial and political blocs that had shaped the civil war in the county.[CITATION-125] That it was won by the Owen\u2013Laugharne\u2013Poyer group on this occasion is perhaps unsurprising. Laugharne\u2019s star was near its zenith in early 1646 as the parliamentary commander who had liberated south-west Wales from the depredations of the royalists. Indeed, the fact that Eliot and Lort had sought to carry the election in an underhand manner in the first place suggests that they were aware of their vulnerability in a fair contest. This may also indicate that the Lorts\u2019 power in Pembrokeshire relied upon their control of the committee rather than their local popularity. Issues such as popular support are, however, almost impossible to gauge from the surviving evidence.The Lort faction did not give up easily on such a potentially rich prize, however. The manuscript tract states that Roger Lort and John Eliot, who were then in London, approached Francis Annesley, Lort\u2019s father-in-law, and had him present a petition against Owen\u2019s return to parliament\u2019s privileges committee. This petition, it was alleged, asserted the \u2018unduenes of the elecc[i]on \u2026 offering scandalous informac[i]ones to blast the creditt of the gent[leman] elected to take of what in them laye all creditt from what hee should offer in the behalfe of that country\u2019.[CITATION-126] This petition was an attempt to undermine Owen\u2019s legitimacy in parliament and was also circulated in the country along with a certificate against Laugharne and \u2018all those that faithfully served in the lowest condic[i]on of the parliaments party there\u2019. Thomas Bowen of Trefloyne and Sampson Lort were said to be instrumental in distributing the document in Pembrokeshire.Shortly after the election, another manoeuvre was made in this orchestrated campaign between London and south-west Wales by Sheriff William Phillipps. On 19 March 1646 he wrote a letter to Speaker Lenthall in which he attacked Rowland Laugharne, claiming that he was unable to discharge his shrieval duties in \u2018this tottering county\u2019 because of \u2018the great usurpation of the martiall power on the civill\u2019. Phillipps painted a picture of Laugharne as a domineering military threat who protected ex-royalists and slighted the authority of parliament\u2019s appointed local representatives.[CITATION-127] His remarkably strident denunciation was probably occasioned by Owen\u2019s victory in the recent poll. It reads like a rather desperate attempt to associate Laugharne, and by extension Owen, with arbitrary military rule and the wishes of a \u2018mischeivous multitude\u2019, and probably sought to strengthen the black propaganda campaign by Thomas Bowen and Sampson Lort in casting doubt on the election and suggesting that Owen\u2019s victory had been secured only by force and royalist interference.Another electoral success provided further evidence that the Laugharne\u2013Poyer\u2013Owen interest retained a good deal of strength and vigour in the county. In September 1645 the House moved to fill the vacancy in the seat of Haverfordwest and Laugharne was the guiding force in this election.[CITATION-128] In October 1645 he wrote to the town\u2019s mayor requesting that they elect his nominee, Sir Robert Needham.[CITATION-129] He stated that the writ of election was not yet in his hands, but that he was expecting it shortly. On 22 November he again wrote to the mayor and corporation supporting Needham for the place.[CITATION-130] The corporation obliged, with the common councilmen endorsing Laugharne\u2019s nomination and, although no record of the election itself has survived, Needham was duly returned. Needham had a north Walian background, but it was probably his connection with the third earl of Essex that brought him and Laugharne together. There was no sign on this occasion that the Lorts attempted to put up their own candidate or challenge this election as they had in the county. Almost certainly they recognised that Laugharne\u2019s influence in the autonomous county borough was too great. Needham represented another important ally for the anti-Lort faction at the political centre. However, he was not a particularly forceful or interventionist member and appears to have been ineffective in pursuing any agenda against the Lorts. It was Laugharne\u2019s Independent opponents who had the more capable and effectual party machine tying their political interests at the centre and in the provinces together.Laugharne\u2019s military successes and victories in the Haverfordwest and county elections represented significant setbacks for the Lort\u2013Eliot faction, although they were able to point to their own victories in Swanley\u2019s acquittal and their continued control of the county committee. A kind of wary balance was thus achieved by mid-1646, although mutual acrimony and recrimination was never far beneath the surface. The rival camps continued to snipe at one another by telling tales of their respective misdeeds during the war. Increasingly this was done through the realm of print and a series of pamphlets was produced in 1646 which dilated on the troubled situation in Pembrokeshire and the deep rivalries which were undermining the public interest there. Poyer pushed for consideration of the debts and arrears he had incurred in maintaining the garrison at Pembroke, while exposing the royalist past of his principal enemies through the press.[CITATION-131] For their part, Roger Lort and particularly John Eliot were active in publishing tracts targeting Poyer which upbraided him for his arbitrary conduct, and which presented his parliamentarianism as cover for an unbridled rapacity and authoritarianism.[CITATION-132] In terms of making effective political connections with the centre, the period 1646\u20137 was critical in fortifying the position of the Eliot\u2013Lort faction and marginalising that of Arthur Owen, Laugharne and Poyer. An important development was the earl of Essex\u2019s death in September 1646. Although his influence had been waning for months, this must have been a blow to Laugharne in particular, who had been sponsored and supported by Essex. Contemporaries noted that Essex\u2019s death was a grievous setback to his followers, whom the earl \u2018keeped all together, who now are like by that alone to fall in pieces \u2026 many of the shyres depended upon him\u2019.[CITATION-133] Although his influence in Pembrokeshire politics was indirect and difficult to define precisely, his demise must have occasioned deep concern among Laugharne and his allies. Conversely, the growing influence of the New Model Army and of political and religious Independency challenged the authority of Presbyterians like Arthur Owen, but also threatened the autonomy of Laugharne\u2019s military authority. In south Wales, the reach of political Independency was extended in no small measure through the agency of the earl of Pembroke and his allies in the south-east.[CITATION-134] It is telling, then, that Roger Lort produced a book of Latin epigrams in 1646 in which he heaped praise on the earl of Pembroke and also included lines in commendation of his secretary, Michael Oldisworth, who was at the core of Independent politics on the Glamorgan county committee. Significantly, the volume also lauded Thomas Fairfax, leader of the New Model Army.[CITATION-135] Moreover, while a verse was presented to the \u2018illustrious\u2019 earl of Essex (clearly the volume was composed before his death), this struck a very different tone, ruminating on the way that Essex supported the war in its early days but that his fervour had cooled, adding that, like Phoebus, his chariot rose in the east and set in the west\u2014presumably a reference to his disaster at the Battle of Lostwithiel.[CITATION-136] These verses provide clear evidence for the Lorts\u2019 alignment with the Independent party after the first civil war\u2014and of the fact that their Independent connections would be used as a weapon against their local Presbyterian opponents between 1646 and 1648.The growing reach of the New Model and political Independency in the post-war period manifested itself partly in a challenge to Presbyterians in local administrative and military roles. Rowland Laugharne\u2019s powerbase lay principally in his military authority, but even as parliament confirmed him as commander-in-chief in south-west Wales in the spring of 1646, efforts were being made to undermine his position. Laugharne\u2019s semi-autonomous force was at odds with the ethos of a single military command structure adopted by the New Model Army. In October 1645, the Independent-supporting naval commander in south Wales, Robert Moulton, wrote to Fairfax describing some of the recent royalist stirs in south Wales. He concluded that these could be prevented by the appointment of a single commander under the Lord General, who would oversee 500 men, \u2018strangers to the place, to whome the rest\u2019 would be subordinate.[CITATION-137] Although not implemented at this time, discussions for reducing the military presence in south Wales gathered momentum after the cessation of hostilities.In August 1646 Laugharne\u2019s forces were among those reviewed by the Commons.[CITATION-138] It resolved that a significant proportion of his forces would be sent into Ireland, leaving only \u2018a small party\u2019 of two troops of horse and five foot companies for local defence.[CITATION-139] The proposal was referred to a committee to which the Pembrokeshire agent, John Eliot, made a telling submission. He argued that Laugharne\u2019s forces should be radically reduced to a mere 200 horse, and added that if Pembroke and Tenby were retained as garrisons, then \u2018It\u2019s much desired that two comaunders with theire companies maie be sent downe to the said garrisons out of the armie of Sir Thomas Fairefax, that the county of Pembrock maie nott suffer as now it doth by the oppression and tirany of the governor\u2019.[CITATION-140] The \u2018governor\u2019 was John Poyer. Despite this partisan intervention, Poyer and Powell evidently continued to have a degree of support in parliament, as they were confirmed as governors on 25 March 1647.[CITATION-141] It seems likely that Sir John Meyrick or Arthur Owen managed to push back against Eliot\u2019s submission, but the Independent threat to their authority in Pembrokeshire was growing. Rowland Laugharne also continued in his post, but his position rested on increasingly uncertain foundations. In April 1647 the Commons reviewed his position as commander of the forces in south Wales and, although he was confirmed in this role, it was only by three votes, with staunch Presbyterians acting as tellers for the \u2018yeas\u2019 and Independents for the \u2018noes\u2019. In addition, the New Model officer and future regicide John Okey was appointed commander of dragoons, effectively Laugharne\u2019s second-in-command.[CITATION-142] This suggests how the waters of Independency were encroaching on the island of Laugharne\u2019s Presbyterian authority in south-west Wales. The erosion of his military and thus his political influence in the face of Independent forces provides a crucial context to his participation in the rebellion against parliament in 1648.The Lorts\u2019 growing influence and authority in Pembrokeshire can also be seen in the organs of local government. They and their associates continued to dominate Pembrokeshire\u2019s county committee and they had important allies on the Cardiganshire body also.[CITATION-143] Probably through Eliot\u2019s agency in London, where appointments were made and approved, however, they also controlled the county\u2019s post-war commission of the peace. The Independent-aligned earl of Pembroke was named asof the county\u2019s commission in April 1647 (he had occupied this position before the war also), and the body soon became a vehicle for the Lort interest. Although the Presbyterians were represented by men like Arthur Owen (himself largely absent in Westminster) and Lewis Barlow, Lort allies like Sir Richard Phillips, James Lewis, John Eliot, Griffith White, Herbert Perrot and Thomas Bowen, along with Roger and Sampson Lort themselves, constituted a powerful majority.[CITATION-144] A later pro-Poyer publication lamented that onetime royalists like the Lorts and Eliot had \u2018by sinister meanes gayned them selves & there partie to bee commissioners, sequestraters, justices of peace, vice admiral, and other officers of cheefe trust in the \u2026 county, to the greate opresion & utter undoeing of all these that have served the parlyment [faithfully]\u2019.[CITATION-145] Their control of the organs of local government gave the Lort faction a significant advantage in the struggle for power in post-war Pembrokeshire, and was central in generating the resentment which exploded into rebellion in 1648.An opportunity to exploit a potential weakness in the administrative armour of the Lort faction, however, arrived with the appointment of a sub-committee for accounts. An established historiography has attested how these often-Presbyterian bodies frequently acted as checks on Independent-supporting county committees, and that their oversight of local committees often produced conflict and confrontation.[CITATION-146] However, county committees often had a determining influence in nominating those who sat on these local sub-committees for accounts. Clement Walker even claimed that such commissioners were frequently \u2018nominated by those members that ought to give accompts\u2019, and this seems likely to have been the case in south-west Wales.[CITATION-147] In theory, those on the county committee were not to sit on sub-committees of accounts, but it seems probable that the confusion between the operation of the accounts sub-committee which had a competency over the three associated counties of south-west Wales, and the effective operation of the Pembrokeshire committee as an independent body, muddied these waters somewhat.In any event, in August 1646 the central committee for taking the accounts of the kingdom received a letter from five Pembrokeshire individuals who had been nominated to administer the oath of office to the newly nominated sub-committeemen. These had been relatively obscure figures in local politics up until this point, although some were county committeemen and most had demonstrable connections with the Owen\u2013Laugharne\u2013Poyer interest. They included Lewis Barlow of Creswell, Arthur Owen\u2019s brother-in-law; Barlow\u2019s relation from Bonville\u2019s Court (St Issels), who had the decidedly Essexian name of Devereux Johnes; George Haward (or Heyward) of Rudbaxton, who later described Sir Hugh Owen and his brother Arthur as \u2018my worthy and welbeloved freinds\u2019 in his will; and William Laugharne of Llangwarran, who was sufficiently close to Sir Hugh to lend him a considerable sum of money.[CITATION-148] These commissioners explained to the central committee that, \u2018upon mature deliberac[i]on had of the incapacity of most of thease gentlemen for that trust\u2019; that is, to serve on the sub-committee for accounts, they had \u2018forboarne to minister the \u2026 oath to any of them \u2026 finding not a competent number of all therein named for the execuc[i]on of that power\u2019.[CITATION-149] They sent a schedule with their letter detailing the reasons why they believed each nominee was \u2018incapable of serving\u2019, but, unfortunately, this has not survived. They directed the central committee to the county MP Arthur Owen \u2018for informac[i]on \u2026 for fit persons to be imployed as subcommittees for accompts in this associac[i]on\u2019. Evidently the factional struggles over administrative control now focused on securing appointments to the accounts sub-committee. This is perhaps unsurprising, as this body would have oversight of the county committee\u2019s spending and thus would also possess a wide latitude for interfering in its work, and probably for reporting misdemeanours and initiating enquiries and investigations into the committeemen\u2019s conduct. As was seen elsewhere, such local sub-committees were effective vehicles for the Presbyterian interest to challenge the powerful Independent presence on the county committees.[CITATION-150] Who were the gentlemen nominated to the Pembrokeshire sub-committee to whom these commissioners objected, and who had nominated them? We are fortunate that their response to the central committee of accounts survives\u2014and the signatories represent a roll-call of Lort supporters.[CITATION-151] They included Roger and Sampson Lort, Griffith White of Henllan, Thomas Bowen of Trefloyne, and John Eliot, junior, son of the Pembrokeshire agent. The other signatories were John Lloyd, probably the army colonel and new recruiter MP for Carmarthenshire who married a daughter of Sir Francis Annesley, making him Roger Lort\u2019s brother-in-law.[CITATION-152] I have been unable definitively to identify the other signatory, David Lewis, although he, along with John Lloyd, was included on a list of those to be trusted on the county\u2019s militia commission drawn up in May 1648 by the New Model officer Thomas Wogan.[CITATION-153] As for who nominated these men in London, we may not be surprised to learn that it was almost certainly John Eliot. Eliot was involved in naming accounts commissioners later that year, and the nature of the appointees, particularly the inclusion of his own son, also argues strongly for his hand in the process.[CITATION-154] The disgruntled nominees complained that, although they had been appointed \u2018commissioners of account\u2019 and had attended \u2018severall daies\u2019 waiting to be administered their oaths, Lewis Barlow and his associates had refused to discharge their duties. Tellingly, the one commissioner whowilling to administer the oath to this group, but who could not do so because two witnesses were required under the terms of the ordinance, was John Lort.[CITATION-155] The nominees concluded their letter ominously by stating that Barlow and the others had refused to proceed \u2018for some sinister respects of their owne\u2019.This controversy ended back with the central committee for accounts, who in turn asked John Eliot and Arthur Owen to resolve the problem. This was impossible, of course, as the impasse was caused largely by the irreconcilable differences between the political factions these two men represented. Nevertheless, they were evidently asked to provide nominees, and in December 1646 Arthur Owen detailed his objections to the three men Eliot had put forward: Roger Lort, Griffith White and Herbert Perrot.[CITATION-156] Owen argued that Eliot himself, and the men he was proposing, were hopelessly conflicted as committeemen who spent parliament\u2019s coin but who were now being proposed as watchdogs to account for it. He further noted that the commissioners appointed to swear their oaths of office had already raised similar objections against Lort and White. Owen thus concluded that the committee should follow the letter of the ordinance \u2018on behaulf of the state and the county by him that serveth parliament for that county\u2019, so that no committeeman be appointed to the sub-committee of accounts, \u2018there beeing others within the \u2026 countie that may serve the state with less nor noe partiallitye\u2019.[CITATION-157] Later that month the central committee ordered \u2018that the names presented by Mr Owen & Mr Elliott to be a sub-committee of accounts for Pembrookshire be done\u2019.[CITATION-158] It would thus appear that some kind of compromise was achieved, although those who were nominated were very minor figures indeed.[CITATION-159] Moreover, they were largely ineffectual and complained of their advanced ages and physical infirmities. Indeed, those who did attend committee meetings would later claim that although their \u2018forwardnesse \u2026 was noe way wantinge\u2019, the \u2018disobedience\u2019 of several of their fellow commissioners severely hampered their work.[CITATION-160] Eliot and his allies had managed to stymie the threat of a sub-committee of accounts populated by allies of Arthur Owen and the Presbyterians. After the New Model\u2019s march on London in August 1647, Presbyterian power at Westminster waned, and this had dire consequences for the Lorts\u2019 antagonists in Pembrokeshire. In September 1647 the central committee for accounts agreed that further names should be added to the Pembrokeshire sub-committee (as well as some to the Cardiganshire body), but, tellingly, these nominees were suggested by John Eliot alone.[CITATION-161] Allegations later flew that the Lort faction\u2019s control of both the county and accounts committees not only helped them avoid scrutiny for their past dalliances with the royalists, but also allowed them to divert significant sums of public money into their own pockets with impunity.[CITATION-162] The reduction of Laugharne\u2019s military force and the appointment of a prominent New Modeller as his second-in-command; the commission of the peace issued in April 1647; the neutralisation of the accounts sub-committee; and the continued operation of John Eliot as county agent, all counterbalanced Arthur Owen\u2019s pyrrhic success at the county hustings in the spring of 1646, and signified a direction of travel which was deeply worrying for the Presbyterian interest in Pembrokeshire. Emboldened by these developments, the Lort\u2013Eliot group moved against John Poyer in the spring of 1647, having him imprisoned in London in an action of \u00a32,000 while he was trying to develop his own case against the Lorts.[CITATION-163] Moreover, when he returned to Pembrokeshire, the now Lort-controlled sub-committee of accounts served him with a warrant demanding he account for \u00a36,000 of wartime expenditure.[CITATION-164] Poyer now became convinced that the Lorts intended to ruin him utterly, and possibly that they sought to have him killed. He decided to get his retaliation in first, and in August 1647 Poyer imprisoned the three Lort brothers in Pembroke Castle.[CITATION-165] This was a move born of desperation rather than strength, however, and he was soon compelled to release them\u2014significantly, because the brothers secured a directive to this effect from Sir Thomas Fairfax.[CITATION-166] This is again suggestive of the connections which the Lorts and their allies had managed to cultivate with the New Model, while Poyer, Laugharne and Arthur Owen remained committed to a Presbyterian cause which by August 1647 was in full retreat.Moves to disband the supernumary forces such as Laugharne\u2019s and effect a significant reduction of the country\u2019s military force in December 1647 were thus of grave import for Laugharne and his allies. It appears that little had been done to effect the cutting of his forces which had been decided a year previously.[CITATION-167] However, Laugharne\u2019s antipathies towards the New Model and the Independents were well known. London\u2019s Presbyterian militia committee apparently approached him in the summer of 1647 to act as a commander for them, before such moves were halted by the New Model\u2019s march on the city. Parliament\u2019s resolution to disband his forces in December 1647, then, was a worrying development. However, along with a raft of legislation from parliament to establish the fiscal apparatus for raising the money to satisfy soldiers\u2019 arrears, there was a doom-laden sting in the tail for Laugharne and Poyer. Parliament also resolved to augment the assessment commissioners for Pembrokeshire by adding Sir Richard Phillips, Griffith White, James Lewis, Roger Lort, Sampson Lort, Thomas Bowen and Herbert Perrot to their number.[CITATION-168] This group would thus be responsible for helping draw down Laugharne and Poyer\u2019s forces and, more damagingly, for auditing them. The scope for punitive retribution by the Lorts was enormous; this provision effectively ensured that Poyer, and perhaps Laugharne also, would face charges devised, and probably adjudicated, by their bitter enemies.By Christmas 1647 John Poyer was already calling forces to him in his redoubt at Pembroke. These developments were communicated by Roger Lort to the senior New Model officer in south Wales, Thomas Horton, whom he addressed in terms of familiarity and friendship.[CITATION-169] Lort was intimately involved with the plans for disbandment in south-west Wales, and evidently worked closely with the New Model hierarchy in their preparations. His letter to Horton and the appointment of the additional Pembrokeshire commissioners on 24 December 1647 demonstrates, to a degree hitherto not fully appreciated, how the process of disbandment in Pembrokeshire was a pugnaciously partisan measure, conducted in a manner that was almost calculated to provoke a violent response.By early January 1648 the New Model governor-elect of Pembroke, Christopher Fleming, had arrived in the county and demanded that Poyer give up his command; the latter refused, noting in his response that he did not covet \u2018any mans life, as mine is thristed [] after by men of bloude\u2019, a clear reference to the Lorts.[CITATION-170] There has always been speculation regarding his reasons for refusing, but it is to be hoped that the foregoing discussion has helped to demonstrate that, in addition to his lack of sympathy with the religious and political aims of the New Model, Poyer believed that acceding to Fairfax\u2019s command would place him in the hands of men bent on his destruction. A similar calculus seems to have determined Rowland Laugharne\u2019s ultimate decision to escape confinement in London, where the suspicious army had detained him, and join Poyer in his armed resistance in May 1648.[CITATION-171] The Lorts were beginning to prepare the ground for a move against Poyer, with John Eliot and Sir Richard Phillips presenting articles against him to the army command in Putney in December 1647. Eliot had these integrated into a defamatory account of Poyer which was published in a weekly newspaper in mid-January 1648.[CITATION-172] The piece dwelled on Poyer\u2019s mistreatment of the Lort brothers in August 1647, as well as offering details about his alleged drunkenness, irreligion and greed. It also called for summary justice against the recalcitrant Poyer\u2014a demand that reflects the Lorts\u2019 complete triumph over their adversaries in the complex local politics of 1647.Poyer attacked Fleming\u2019s forces in March 1648 and was soon setting out declarations of loyalty to the king. This helped to spark off a wider rising which itself was subsumed in the nationwide disruptions which have become known as the \u2018Second Civil War\u2019.[CITATION-173] Even in these desperate events, the factionalism of Pembrokeshire politics was readily apparent. Laugharne\u2019s officers set forth a declaration in early March 1648 which denied reports that they were in league with Poyer, but also noted that they had been \u2018contumeliously traduced\u2019 in print by \u2018Mr John Eliott\u2019.[CITATION-174] When Thomas Wogan arrived in the county in May, he informed Speaker Lenthall that Arthur Owen had had \u2018many consultations\u2019 with ringleaders of the rebellion, and that his late arrival to implement the disbanding \u2018gave great encouradgment to theire disobedience\u2019. He added that Arthur\u2019s brother Sir Hugh\u2019s servants and retainers had joined with Poyer.[CITATION-175] The names of those Wogan recommended to be militia commissioners in the three south-western counties could have been chosen by Roger Lort himself.[CITATION-176] After a siege led by Oliver Cromwell, Poyer, Powell and Laugharne were defeated. The three were initially sentenced to death, but ultimately only Poyer faced the firing squad. Their rebellion helped precipitate the national political crisis of late 1648 which culminated in Pride\u2019s Purge (in which Arthur Owen and Sir Robert Needham were secluded) and the execution of Charles I in January 1649. The revolution laid open the way to the unhindered takeover of local government by the Lorts and their allies. The ghosts of their royalist pasts were occasionally dredged up, most effectively by the onetime cleric of St Michael\u2019s Pembroke, William Beech, who, it is worth noting, was instituted there in 1639 by the earl of Essex.[CITATION-177] Such allegations were really little more than an annoyance to a Lort clique which now had unopposed control of county government under the fledgling Commonwealth.So we arrive back at the early republic and Hugh Peter\u2019s note about the reconciliation of Sir Hugh Owen and Roger Lort after their long and bitter feud. Historians have not paid sufficient attention to the manner in which the factional alignments that grew out of their complex struggle helped structure Pembrokeshire\u2019s political history during the 1640s in profound ways. Indeed, it was not only Peters who recognised the central significance of this quarrel for recent developments. In 1650 William Beech offered up to the Rump Parliament an account of John Eliot\u2019s multifarious financial abuses, which had caused such resentment in the county. He finished by asking that:[parliament\u2019s] wisdom might be seene in composing the unhappy differences in the county of Pembrooke, between two eminent families there, whose divisions were very intricate and lamentable, and it is feared are such yet; and that the county of Pembrooke may be thought upon for her virgine love to their proceedings, and because the late defilement there amongst some of them was done by rape upon her, her haire tyed to the stake, and great violence executed.[CITATION-178] This striking image suggests how one Essexian\u2014adapting his language for a Commonwealth audience, of course\u2014represented the terrible disruption and confusion wrought in Pembrokeshire by war. Beech was also arguing, however, that these upheavals were intimately tied up with the \u2018unhappy differences\u2019 between \u2018two eminent families\u2019. Although the continuities are neither simple nor straightforward, this article has argued that Beech and Peters recognised a factional architecture which underpinned the politics of the 1640s when most historians have not.The divisions between the Owens of Orielton and the Lorts of Stackpole and their constellation of allies and associates can be traced from the late 1630s down to 1649. Although they did not override or render merely instrumental the broader political and religious differences of this period, they certainly gave them their own local complexion and significance. While the Owen\u2013Laugharne\u2013Poyer interest was Presbyterian and the Lort\u2013Eliot one was Independent, these labels were shot through with familial and factional connections as well as politic positionings and repositionings as the tumultuous and rapidly developing politics of the 1640s swept over the county. Although figures such as Sampson Lort were recognisably radical in their political and religious outlook, we cannot forget his royalist \u2018moment\u2019 in 1643, or the fact that his closest ally and elder brother, Roger, never seems to have shared his religious convictions. Indeed, Roger Lort, this \u2018subtill ambodexter\u2019 and friend of the New Model, would manage to obtain a baronetcy after the Restoration: quite a feat of political gymnastics.[CITATION-179] These factional dynamics remind us that, while we have moved beyond the Everittian understanding of counties as self-contained arenas of political action, we should nonetheless remain alive to the particular configurations of familial as well as ideological politics which obtained in the shires of England and Wales. As Michael Braddick has observed, the ways in which demands for allegiance and loyalty were received in the provinces were products of discrete \u2018social and economic structure[s] \u2026 local histor[ies] and political culture[s]\u2019.[CITATION-180] This speaks to a diversity in local patterns of political commitment which owes a good deal to pre-existing social and political structures, including factional differences that emerged from long-standing, but not necessarily ideologically grounded, divisions among the local elite. The Pembrokeshire example suggests that in some regions we may need to reintegrate factional divisions into our analyses as a more profound and potentially more enduring element of civil war politics than the current literature readily acknowledges.Despite its focus on the particularly local dynamics of the civil wars, this article has also integrated the factional dimension of county politics with an analysis of the interconnectedness of Pembrokeshire and Westminster. Its narrative traces the significant growth and intensity of political communication and interaction between centre and periphery which occurred during the 1640s. Connections at the centre were vital for negotiating the treacherous waters of political change, and the Lorts had crucial advantages with their contacts John White, Richard Swanley and the Annesleys, as well as the appointment of John Eliot as the county\u2019s agent in early 1645. This appointment was seen as a violently partisan measure, undertaken by the Lort allies on the committee in the face of some opposition, as Arthur Owen stated \u2018on purpose [for Eliot] to beare them out in theire accounts & other charges\u2019.[CITATION-181] After his appointment Eliot was an influential figure to be found \u2018at Parliament\u2019s door\u2019, getting business done for his friends and allies in the far west. He was a vital figure in securing the Lort ascendancy in Pembrokeshire, but this was only viable because of his connections at the heart of political and military power in the capital. These contacts with the Independents in London were replicated through the emerging radical bloc in south-east Wales around the earl of Pembroke and Michael Oldisworth in 1645\u20136. This, along with Roger Lort\u2019s own developing relationship with the Army hierarchy, meant that his faction was well positioned for success in the local arena when the Presbyterian bubble burst in 1647.We should be aware, however, that men like Laugharne and Poyer also had notable allies at the centre. Theirs was a much more shadowy, and evidently less effective, web of connections which reached eastwards. It appears that the earl of Essex was an important prop for their interests, and that this connection probably operated through local associates such as Sir John Meyrick. In this Presbyterian camp we can also place the Denbigh MP Simon Thelwall. Essex\u2019s death in September 1646 almost certainly represented a damaging blow to the Pembrokeshire moderates\u2019 aspirations. Although this came at a time when Laugharne\u2019s influence was at its greatest, the rise of the Independents soon undercut his local superiority. Indeed, the narrative presented here indicates that the Independent political machine was more responsive to and interested in local power politics than its Presbyterian adversary. It is also the case that the Presbyterian bloc faced impediments and problems in getting their message effectively heard in London. John Poyer complained on one occasion that his letters to parliament had been intercepted by agents of the local committee while his own servant had been stopped from journeying to London.[CITATION-182] One thread of the anti-Lort faction\u2019s complaints was that figures at the centre were being misinformed about events in Pembrokeshire and the political histories of their agents there. They were, in other words, unable effectively to have their version of events communicated to those who managed the levers of provincial power.This discussion has also shown the significance of controlling local office in post-war provincial politics, something which was, of course, a product of the capacity to make and maintain fruitful and effective connections at the centre. While the Laugharne\u2013Owen\u2013Poyer group managed some important victories in the county and Haverfordwest elections in early 1646, these were counterbalanced by the Lort control of local commissions. The political manoeuvring which allowed them effectively to gain control of the county committee puzzled contemporaries as it has done scholars ever since, but the intervention of John White was the fulcrum on which the balance of power in Pembrokeshire local office pivoted in 1644\u20135. The Lorts augmented their success by capturing the commission of the peace and heading off the challenge presented by the establishment of the sub-committee of accounts. After White\u2019s demise, the adroit agency of John Eliot at Westminster was critical in these developments.It is not this article\u2019s position that Pembrokeshire politics in the 1640s constituted a factional confrontation which was empty of ideological meaning. However, it does argue that we need to pay more attention to the comments of contemporaries like Hugh Peter and William Beech about the centrality and enduring nature of gentry faction during the wars. The Owen\u2013Lort divide endured through the vicissitudes of the civil wars, and it structured in fundamental ways the disposition of local parties. This gentry split did not condition or determine the allegiance of the elites in the county, let alone most of the populace, who remain an obscure presence in the historical record. However, it did help define the nature and scope of political action in its local contexts. While people were supportive of or opposed to the royalists or the New Model Army, these positions took on subtly different meanings in the county because of the factional alignments which constituted something akin to political tectonic plates upon which such ideological positions rested, and from which such positions took on a particular complexion. Although Pembrokeshire\u2019s politics was not simply about faction and connection, these variables are fundamental to a better understanding of the county\u2019s civil war history."

    "text": "This article explores the political career and writings of Richard Champion (1743\u20131791), a Bristolian Quaker and merchant who acted as a local supporter and agent of the Rockingham Whigs. It aims to recover a forgotten aspect of Lewis Namier\u2019s original ambition to understand eighteenth-century politics through the perspective of relatively ordinary people such as merchants and civil servants. However, against old Namierite assumptions, as well as much of the recent historiography on the post-1760 period in British politics which focuses on a dichotomous conflict between \u2018radical Whigs\u2019 and \u2018new Tories\u2019, this article restores the importance of the Rockingham Whigs. Importantly, it shows that a commercial Dissenter such as Champion could be fully attuned to the aristocratic and party-centred interpretation of British politics associated with the Rockinghamites and Edmund Burke, and thus encourages us to consider the idea of \u2018aristocratic government\u2019 in inclusive and eclectic ways. The case-study of Champion demonstrates that a close reading of political correspondence from the period can confirm, as well as destabilise, the Whig history of party.In 1928, Sir Lewis Namier, somewhat surprisingly considering his reputation, made a case for the study of the \u2018ordinary men\u2019 who made up the \u2018political nation\u2019.[CITATION-1] While in his own work\u2014and that of the History of Parliament project he helped to establish\u2014this came to mean researching the biographies of members of parliament, Namier originally intended the term to extend to civil servants and merchants as well as to politicians. Although some recent commentators have suggested that Namierite political history is \u2018now not much in fashion\u2019, this article argues that Namier\u2019s call for us to examine eighteenth-century politics through the perspective of relatively ordinary people is a highly valuable one, especially if extended beyond parliament and incorporating the influence of ideas and ideology.[CITATION-2] It considers the political career and writings of Richard Champion (1743\u20131791), who was a merchant and, for a brief time, a civil servant, but most importantly was a local supporter and agent of a parliamentary party, the Rockingham Whigs. The Rockingham Whig party connection has commonly been interpreted as \u2018unusually aristocratic\u2019 even by eighteenth-century standards.[CITATION-3] This may be true, but should not distract us from the fact that the connection prided itself on its association with merchant communities and city traders, and its willingness to consult them on policy. Champion has mainly been studied in relation to his position as Edmund Burke\u2019s closest supporter in Bristol during the latter\u2019s period as member of parliament for the city in 1774\u201380, or alternatively as a pioneering porcelain manufacturer.[CITATION-4] However, the two main studies of the Rockingham Whigs barely mention him.[CITATION-5] As will be shown, Champion\u2019s affiliation with this party connection was much broader and more long-standing than his relationship with Burke, important as it was. A study of Champion as a local supporter-cum-agent of a parliamentary party illuminates key aspects of eighteenth-century politics, both locally and nationally. These include the nature of extra-parliamentary political communities and identities and how they could relate to national and imperial politics, as well as to the circulation of ideas.[CITATION-6] Following Namier, the 1760s are often interpreted as a confusing decade, dominated by factionalism and personal followings rather than party and political principles, and only subsequently given ideological coherenceby the likes of Burke and Horace Walpole.[CITATION-7] Historians have recently sought to reintegrate ideas into the decade by highlighting the importance of a distinct Patriot ideology, or the clash between \u2018a new Toryism\u2019 wanting \u2018to preserve the aristocratic-oligarchic character of the British political system\u2019 on the one hand, and \u2018radical\u2019 Whiggism on the other.[CITATION-8] This article will also stress the importance of ideology, but with a focus on the aristocratic and commercial political creed of the Rockingham Whigs. The Rockingham party viewed itself as the inheritors of the old corps of Whigs, who had held power for most of the period since the Hanoverian Succession in 1714, under the premierships of Sir Robert Walpole, Henry Pelham and the Duke of Newcastle. When Newcastle was driven out of government in 1762, Charles Watson-Wentworth, second marquess of Rockingham, wrote to him to assure him of the support of \u2018all the Old Whigs\u2019.[CITATION-9] Rockingham resigned from his position as Lord of the Bedchamber to join Newcastle in opposition. After Newcastle retired from politics at the start of 1768, he let it be known \u2018[t]hat all His Friends should concur with My Lord Rockingham, in such Measures, as He shall take, for the Support of the Whig Cause\u2019.[CITATION-10] The most famous and eloquent spokesperson for these self-described \u2018Old Whigs\u2019 was Burke, but there were others who subscribed to, and helped articulate and campaign for, the principles of this party, including Champion in Bristol.As a Quaker and an urban merchant, Champion\u2019s background was similarly humble to that of the Irish self-made man Burke, as Champion often stressed in his letters.[CITATION-11] In the interpretation of scholars such as Isaac Kramnick, Champion ought to have been a wholehearted \u2018bourgeois\u2019 and \u2018progressive\u2019.[CITATION-12] Yet he was fully committed to the aristocratic ethos of the Rockingham Whigs. For Champion, the Rockingham party was the best protector of Britain\u2019s mixed and balanced constitution, because of its distance from royal obsequiousness and unrestrained popularity alike.[CITATION-13] Champion thus belonged to the largely forgotten group of Dissenting urban merchants and manufacturers who rejected \u2018radicalism\u2019 and its demands for shorter parliaments and place bills, and instead put their faith in aristocratic Whiggism. Crucially, his defence of \u2018aristocratic government\u2019 was constitutional and party-centred. It did not rest on any idea of the intrinsic quality of blue-blooded men. As he wrote: \u2018The passions of persons of therank are, at the best, like those of other men; generally speaking, they are much worse\u2019.[CITATION-14] Aristocratic Whiggism in the second half of the eighteenth century entailed a specific interpretation of recent political history, with the accession of George III being a transformative event that seemed to the Rockinghamites to compromise the Revolution Settlement by increasing the influence of the Crown and reviving Toryism. Since Namier\u2019s day, this interpretation has often been dismissed as mythology.[CITATION-15] But while the mental world of political actors rarely reflected the positions of their adversaries accurately\u2014my argument here is not that George III conspired to change the constitution or that his ministers were Tories\u2014it was nevertheless important in shaping behaviour. Since most conspiracy theories turn out to be untrue, they are often all dismissed as examples of confused thinking when, in fact, at certain times they provide the most rational explanation of complex historical problems.[CITATION-16] After George III\u2019s accession in 1760, Champion\u2019s specific brand of Whiggism was in retreat and its supporters found it exceedingly difficult to reverse the trend. The Whigs had to explain why this was the case.[CITATION-17] As a Quaker, Champion should in theory have shunned rank, but instead he viewed aristocracy as an essential constitutional principle in a similar manner to his friend (and in some ways mentor) Burke. We should note that, while he was a believer and at least periodically active in the Society of Friends, Champion was not a conventional Quaker since he was not a strict pacifist. He celebrated the legacy of Britain\u2019s imperial conquests in the Seven Years War and at least implicitly accepted the slave trade in private (although he condemned the institution of slavery in his political writing).[CITATION-18] The arming of one of his ships\u2014named\u2014for defensive purposes during the American conflict, combined with his financial difficulties in the late 1770s, appears to have led to his exclusion from the Society of Friends in Bristol.[CITATION-19] Champion merits attention not only because of his circumstances but also because of his relative articulacy. He was a literary man, fond of both reading and writing, even though he dispatched many of his own drafts to the fireplace. As a Protestant Dissenter, he was formally excluded from Oxford and Cambridge; nor was he sent to a Scottish or Dutch university, which was common among learned Dissenting families.[CITATION-20] As he put it, his merchant background committed him to a \u2018narrow Sphere of Life\u2019.[CITATION-21] He relentlessly pursued self-education, however, and was a founding member and the driving force behind the Bristol Library Society, which put great emphasis on the utility of reading among those engaged in trade and manufacturing.[CITATION-22] Champion\u2019s borrowing records at the library testify that he was chiefly interested in political and historical works, Enlightenment travel literature and classics.[CITATION-23] Moreover, he collected his own books, some of which ended up in an equivalent subscription library in Charleston, South Carolina, where he emigrated in 1784.[CITATION-24] In the 1780s, he wrote and published two extensive pamphlets setting out his political and commercial principles, one of which was translated into French.[CITATION-25] These writings will be examined in detail in later sections of this article. It will begin, however, by tracing Champion\u2019s political formation and opinions in the 1760s and his formal association with the Rockingham Whigs in the 1770s.Priding itself as the second city of England, Bristol\u2019s electorate of 5,000 was the third largest of the English boroughs, after London and Westminster. It was a so-called open constituency, in which voters and politicians were divided into Whigs and Tories long after these terms had become more confused in national politics.[CITATION-26] It was also a city in which Protestant Dissenters were not only politically active but also unusually affluent and influential. The Lewin\u2019s Mead Unitarian Chapel alone boasted eleven mayors between 1754 and 1784, representing more than a third of the period.[CITATION-27] The Whigs and the Tories in the city were represented by the Union Club and the Steadfast Society, respectively, both originally formed in the 1730s. Religious nonconformists dominated the former club. Since there are no surviving minutes of the Union Club\u2014unlike the Steadfast Society, which met frequently except during a hiatus between 1769 and 1775[CITATION-28] \u2014we cannot determine precisely when Champion joined the local Whig association. By the mid-1760s, however, when Champion was in his early twenties, he was evidently politically engaged.Champion had little difficulty in identifying the good and the bad in national politics in the early years of George III\u2019s reign. In correspondence with American business partners, he complained about Lord Bute\u2019s Peace of Paris and George Grenville\u2019s subsequent administration (1763\u20135), during which \u2018very fatal Blows were struck at the Commerce of the Empire\u2019.[CITATION-29] Champion referred chiefly to the Stamp Act, the most well-known of Grenville\u2019s colonial measures. Early on, he viewed the Rockingham ministry, which took office in July 1765, as a saving grace and identified it with the Whig cause in the shape of the Hanoverian interest.[CITATION-30] It is also worth noting that Champion, like the Rockingham Whigs in the metropole, was convinced that Bute continued to act behind the scenes after his formal resignation in 1763.[CITATION-31] By contrast, the short-lived Rockingham administration stressed that it had ceased communication with Bute, the so-called minister behind the curtain.[CITATION-32] Although Champion thought highly of Burke\u2019s speeches in parliament for the repeal of the Stamp Act, he was not himself entirely in favour of repeal. For him, it was \u2018the mode employed in the Collection of the duty\u2019 rather than the duty itself which was unreasonable. He believed that it was important to ameliorate the potentially bad effects of the repeal, and \u2018let them [the Americans] remember with Gratitude, the generous Care of Parliament for their Ease and Benefit\u2019. He realised, however, that the Rockingham ministry was compelled to repeal the Act, since \u2018Out of Doors the whole Kingdom seem to be united upon the same Sentiment\u2019. If no action had been taken, it could have led to \u2018the Resignation of the most able and best Men\u2019, which would have been disastrous, Champion emphasised in his correspondence.[CITATION-33] There are indications that he was part of the delegation of Bristol\u2019s Society of Merchant Venturers led by Thomas Farr, which was sent to London to lobby for the repeal of the Act.[CITATION-34] When Champion later established a correspondence with Rockingham and wrote of his short administration as a time \u2018when the helm of Government was guided by a steady, gentle, yet knowing hand, when Commerce flourished, and civil dissentions ceased to rage in this wide Empire\u2019, he was not expressing mere flattery but long-held beliefs.[CITATION-35] The first Rockingham ministry lasted only one year. Champion complained in the mid-1770s that the arrangement made by Chatham after the resignation of Rockingham in July 1766 \u2018put the Tories into place, [and] have enabled the [Tories] to domineer in this Country ever since, and to revive the old Scheme of making America submit to Taxation\u2019.[CITATION-36] Already in the late 1760s\u2014before Burke had published his(1770)\u2014Champion was convinced that the government\u2019s principles were \u2018tending to arbitrary power\u2019.[CITATION-37] At this time, \u2018Wilkes and Liberty\u2019 emerged as the fulcrum of the opposition.[CITATION-38] Having been arrested for seditious libel after criticising the king\u2019s speech in 1763 and declared an outlaw the following year, John Wilkes fled to France to avoid imprisonment on these grounds (and additionally for the publication of the obscene, a satire of Alexander Pope\u2019s). In 1768, he was compelled to return to England by his financial situation and sought election to Parliament to obtain legal immunity. The Grafton ministry expelled him from Parliament, but Wilkes was repeatedly re-elected and ejected as MP for Middlesex in a series of by-elections, while himself being locked up in the King\u2019s Bench prison. The whole episode led to significant unrest in London. The question of whether the House of Commons could rightfully disqualify a representative elected by the people raised constitutional questions, and commentators from many corners were eager to voice their opinions.[CITATION-39] Champion and the Rockingham Whigs sided with Wilkes.[CITATION-40] However, already at this juncture, the young Bristolian Whig was wary of the perceived extremism of \u2018Wilkes and Liberty\u2019 and the tumult associated with the movement.[CITATION-41] \u2018Whilst the people attack the violators of the laws [i.e., the ministry], they should themselves be obedient to them\u2019, he stressed.[CITATION-42] Champion was also appalled by the character of Wilkes, whose personality was disliked by many in his own camp. John Horne Tooke, founder of the Society of the Supporters of the Bill of Rights, cut off his ties with Wilkes and established a new Constitutional Society.[CITATION-43] Many of the members, especially the Protestant Dissenters, in the reformist faction disapproved of Wilkes\u2019s womanising, indebtedness and general lack of morality. It has been suggested that the Unitarian Richard Price was referring to Wilkes when he said that \u2018an immoral patriot\u2019 was a contradiction in terms.[CITATION-44] Champion shared this aversion to Wilkes\u2019s character, but he was also apprehensive about Wilkeite politics, which was supportive of political reform. As Champion wrote to his correspondents Caleb and John Lloyd, \u2018We should take care \u2026 in the midst of our just and necessary opposition to Government, not to adopt measures which may be injurious to the constitution\u2019.[CITATION-45] Thus, when Champion later wrote that \u2018The People are caught by the sound of the purity of the Constitution, and forget, that while they are cutting away a multitude of cancerous wounds, the Body is likely to bleed to Death\u2019, he was again articulating long-cherished opinions.[CITATION-46] For Champion, Whiggism entailed protecting the integrity of Britain\u2019s mixed and balanced constitution, and defending all its parts. As we shall see, he thought that this was best achieved through the instrument of \u2018aristocratic party\u2019. Opposition had to be constitutional and conducted in a legal manner within the existing framework. This could include extra-parliamentary political activity, but it must not degenerate into riot. Moreover, from this ideological perspective, political reformers who wished to alter the balance in the constitution were potentially as dangerous as George III and Bute, who he believed had increased the power of the Crown. For this reason, the American question presented a delicate problem.Champion was convinced that the legal rights of the Americans had been violated. Taxation of the Americans was against the spirit of the British constitution, according to which people could only be taxed by either their own consent or that of their representatives in Parliament, neither of which applied to the American colonists. However, the issue instigated widespread debates about reforming the British constitution and its system of representation. While the situation of the Americans required redress, Champion was unconvinced that political reform was needed in Britain. Despite his own initial activism, in December 1769 he was disparaging about the Petitioning Movement, which he believed played into the hands of the \u2018Court faction\u2019:The Leaders are in themselves so little adequate to the Task. They have assumed, and conduct themselves with such a wildness of popularity, and with so little attention to common sense, that with respect to the great point in view, the removal of the dangerous Faction at Court, which threatens Destruction to the Liberties of the whole Empire, it can have no Effect \u2026 The Plan that were [] given to us, was in the true spirit of wild and licentious popularity\u2014annual Parliaments\u2014a total exclusion of all placemen and pensioners\u2014oaths to be taken by Candidates never to accept a place, peerage or pension; and to vote for an equal Representation, destroying all the Boroughs, & encreasing the County members: a plan which in the infancy of a new state, uncorrupted by luxury or Conquest of small beginnings, & without Riches, was under sensible and good leaders, a wise and beneficial one. But in the state of England at this time was throwing a weight into the hands of ministers, securing them in their places, and affording no hopes of removal of the Court Faction.[CITATION-47] Although reform may have been desirable in principle, he emphasised that \u2018in an English Constitution alterations are difficult and dangerous, and it is better to suffer smaller Evils, than run the risque of greater\u2019.[CITATION-48] With reference to the turbulent seventeenth century, Champion highlighted the peril of political revolutions. The British owed their liberty to the Glorious Revolution, but Oliver Cromwell\u2019s military dictatorship demonstrated that political power tended to infringe on liberty. The silver lining of James II\u2019s violent measures was that they precipitated his removal. By contrast, \u2018the gradual abuse of Liberty\u2019 under Charles II had risked familiarising the people with its loss. To preserve the precious yet fragile settlement of 1688\u20139, Champion underscored the urgent need \u2018to prevent the opposition of the people in both Countries [i.e., Britain and the American colonies] from rising into a flame too difficult to be quenched\u2019.[CITATION-49] In his attitudes towards the duties of opposition and the character of Whiggism, he found kindred spirits in Burke and the aristocratic leaders of the Rockingham Whigs.Champion became seriously involved with the Rockingham Whig party through Burke, whom he supported and helped get elected as a member of parliament for Bristol in 1774. Because of the immense expense involved in election contests in a large constituency such as Bristol, the local Whigs and Tories had at several times struck agreements to nominate one candidate each, notably from 1756 until 1768.[CITATION-50] By 1774, however, the Whigs in the city had become discontented with their representative, the Irish peer Robert Nugent, Viscount Clare, who supported the government\u2019s American policy, and had become a \u2018courtier\u2019, as Champion wrote to Burke.[CITATION-51] Those Whigs who wanted to replace Clare sought another candidate. The American merchant Henry Cruger, whose father-in-law (Samuel Peach) was a prominent local merchant, had emerged as the main candidate, but Champion was suspicious of Cruger for much the same reason that he was wary of Wilkes: Cruger had \u2018not only given himself a Loose in the Youthful Follies of Life, but has at the same time preserved no Appearances\u2019. Instead, Champion and some of his friends wanted Burke as a candidate, and he described him in glowing terms:Indisputably the first literary Character in the Kingdom, he was a perfect Master of its commercial Interests. These joined to a true Knowledge of the Constitution, which he had for so many years supported with inflexible Integrity, he was the Man who would do Honor to the Cause, and whom even their Opponents must admire\u2019.[CITATION-52] That Champion began by highlighting Burke\u2019s literary reputation may not be surprising but it is still noteworthy. Champion knew of Burke not only as a politician but also as a man of letters, having been present at the committee meeting of the Bristol Library Society on 11 January 1774 when it agreed to order Burke\u2019s(1757).[CITATION-53] After the election campaign, Burke donated twenty guineas to the Library Society, and was made a member for life.[CITATION-54] It is likely that this donation was actually made by Champion and his other supporters on the committee in a bid to strengthen Burke\u2019s status in his new constituency. This is highly plausible since Burke later said that he had not spent a single penny of his own money on the election, which is reputed to have cost his campaign \u00a310,000.[CITATION-55] Champion worked tirelessly for Burke during the Bristol years. During the election itself, an associate wrote on Champion\u2019s behalf to one of his American business partners, saying: \u2018Mr. C. is so very much engaged in behalf of Mr. Edmd. Burkes Election for member to represent this City in Parliament that he has not time to write you himself\u2019.[CITATION-56] Burke was elected as the second member for Bristol with 2,707 votes, behind Cruger\u2019s 3,565 but ahead of the Tory candidate Matthew Brickdale, who received 2,456, and Clare, who had withdrawn early in the contest with only 283 votes.[CITATION-57] After Burke departed from Bristol in the wake of the election, he told his loyal supporter that \u2018I really parted from you as from friends of long standing\u2019.[CITATION-58] Champion\u2019s friendship with Burke was a decisive moment for the Bristolian merchant, as his important new friend provided him with both political and intellectual stimulation. As he later wrote:The first and greatest of my pleasures, next to that of my family, have been the result of his [Burke\u2019s] friendship. He has improved my mind, he has added to my satisfactions. He found me in a narrow and contracted Circle, and taught me to forget the little prejudices affixed to the Situation, in which my Lot was cast. Weak as I am, whatever Strength I have, I owe to him.[CITATION-59] The Champion family became close to that of the Burkes, including Burke\u2019s brother Richard, and his collaborator William Burke. Champion and his wife Judith gave what is generally considered to be the finest specimen of his porcelain manufacturing, a tea service now held at the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, to Burke\u2019s wife Jane, with an inscription in Latin which translates as \u2018to J. Burke the best of British wives\u2019.[CITATION-60] The work Champion did for Burke earned him the respect of the most senior members of the Rockingham connection, notably the Marquess himself and the Duke of Portland, who later succeeded Rockingham as the nominal leader of the party. In 1775, Champion commenced a long-standing correspondence with both Rockingham and Portland. In this correspondence, he kept the Whig aristocrats informed about local party activity and American affairs. In the early years of the American conflict in particular, he sent regular letters to Rockingham, Portland and others with intelligence he obtained through his business and family contacts in the New World.[CITATION-61] He also disseminated pro-American propaganda in Bristol.[CITATION-62] From the beginning, Rockingham expressed his gratitude to Champion for keeping him abreast of American news by giving his own views on the state of politics.[CITATION-63] Champion also informed the Whig lords of local political activity in support of the Whig opposition, for example by collecting more than 1,000 signatures for a petition to the Crown in favour of reconciliation with America. The signatories included fifteen members of the Bristol Corporation (the mayor, two sheriffs, three aldermen, and nine common councilmen).[CITATION-64] The address was in tune with the policy of the Rockingham Whigs, who had passed the Declaratory Act (1766) confirming parliamentary sovereignty over the empire during its administration, but opposed coercive methods to keep the Americans in the British fold.[CITATION-65] Within a short space of time, Champion became more confident in formulating his political opinions and analysis in lengthy letters to Rockingham and Portland. The letters were dominated by the problems caused by the American crisis for the commercial interests of Britain and especially Bristol. \u2018When the Manufacturies in general begin to fail (for some already have) \u2026 the people must open their Eyes, and emerge from their Supineness\u2019, he wrote to Rockingham on 12 August 1775.[CITATION-66] His own manufacturing business in porcelain struggled in the late 1770s, but the issue of how to make people engage with the American question was a continuous problem raised by Champion in his letters to the party leaders. From this correspondence, it is evident that he believed the Rockingham Whigs represented an intermediate position between the \u2018overgrown Influence of the Court\u2019 on the one hand\u2014now represented by Lord North\u2019s ministry nationally and supported by the Steadfast Society in Bristol\u2014and the \u2018wild popularity\u2019 of Wilkes on the national stage and Cruger locally on the other.[CITATION-67] The competition between these two extremes had led to a disastrous chain of events: the disaffection of the North American colonies, the crumbling of commerce and the onset of general languor and distrust. According to Champion, the restoration of the Rockingham Whigs to power alone could save the nation. \u2018Could this Nation but once more behold the Whig administration of 1766, it might again lift up its head to Glory and Riches!\u2019, he wrote to Portland.[CITATION-68] Being convinced that \u2018Commerce can never flourish, but under the Government of free and enlarged Minds\u2019, the key was to change both men and measures, in accordance with Burke\u2019s party doctrine set out in theEven late in the 1770s, Champion continued to blame Wilkes for giving the cause of liberty a bad name and swinging the public\u2019s favour from opposition to government, which still impeded the opposition to the American war. The general languor among the people was \u2018alarming\u2019, he wrote to Portland. \u2018Every effort of the Whigs, could not bring the People forward in Opposition, or oblige them to act with the Zeal and Resolution, which had, not long before, made those very Ministers tremble\u2019.[CITATION-69] In other words, the problem was \u2018both the System of Government, and the Disposition of the People\u2019.[CITATION-70] When informing Rockingham of the temper of the people in Bristol in 1779, he lamented that \u2018there are little hopes of rousing [the Whigs] to a Sense of their Danger, and the necessity of a warm and vigorous support of the Opposition\u2019.[CITATION-71] For Champion, this languor risked damaging consequences for the party as well as the nation. He believed that the Whigs in Bristol were deceived in believing that they were safe under a Hanoverian monarch. They failed to recognise that George III \u2018acts upon so opposite a System to the other Princes of his House\u2019 and that \u2018the present Court is composed of Men of the most obnoxious principles\u2019.[CITATION-72] During the Whig Supremacy, the Whigs had become accustomed to supporting the government in opposition to Jacobitism, and this habit was difficult to break, according to Champion. Jacobitism had a long history in Bristol.[CITATION-73] Many of the members of the Bristol Library Society were Tories, and some may even have been former Jacobites, such as William Turner, who was a member of a reputed Jacobite club that met at Nag\u2019s Head on Wine Street.[CITATION-74] For Champion, the local Whigs had not fully understood that they had to \u2018destroy the [Court] system\u2019. He told Rockingham that he had taken every measure to convince the Whigs in Bristol of the present danger and urged them to unite in an address to the king. \u2018It is a Crime to be inactive when so much is at stake\u2019, Champion wrote to Rockingham, highlighting the threat from France, which had now entered the war on the American side. He warned the party leaders that the Tories were firm and united, unlike the Whigs.[CITATION-75] Although the moderate among them might recognise the destructiveness of the present system\u2014many of the Bristol Tories were also merchants who struggled during the American War\u2014they would never promote a Whig administration because of partisanship and the memory of proscription during the reigns of George I and George II.[CITATION-76] In short, \u2018the Tories would sooner perish in the Fire which they have lighted up, than owe their Safety to Opposition\u2019.[CITATION-77] P.T. Underdown argued that Champion may not have been the most effective agent for Burke, since between 1776 and 1780 he did not advise him to visit Bristol.[CITATION-78] In these years, Burke\u2019s popularity waned in the city, as a result of his support for easing trade restrictions on Ireland.[CITATION-79] At the start of 1780, Champion predicted, accurately as it turned out, that the Tories might be able to win both of the Bristol seats, as the Whigs had done in 1774.[CITATION-80] His initial pessimism turned into cautious optimism, however, and he once again worked hard to have Burke re-elected. The main problem was that Burke\u2019s former Whig colleague, Cruger, had started to oppose Burke, and courted popular as well as Tory opinion, the latter through his friendship with the Methodist leader John Wesley (with whom he later fell out as well).[CITATION-81] For Champion, Cruger represented \u2018inconsistency\u2019:he is both Whig and Tory, American and anti-American, a strong supporter, or a violent opposer of Government, according to the Sentiments of the voters he is canvassing. He by this means has formed a strong Interest with the common People, especially amongst the Clubs \u2026 with the principal people he has, I may almost say, no Interest at all, it is so trifling.[CITATION-82] Against this background, Champion wanted to restore the settlement between the Whigs and Tories, suggesting that each party should nominate one candidate only. Despite gaining the support of many prominent Bristolians, Burke withdrew from the contest in the face of Tory strength and division among the Whigs.[CITATION-83] The Whigs lost because they not only had to contend against the Tories, but also against Cruger, who \u2018usurped\u2019 the tradesmen, in Champion\u2019s term.[CITATION-84] In the wake of the defeat, however, Champion was confident that the Whigs would be eager to make amends. He told Portland: \u2018they are now forming a select Party of the honest part of the Whigs \u2026 [convinced of] the Necessity of destroying all the corrupted parts of their Body, and consider the destruction of Mr Cruger and his friends, as the firmest Cement of the Whigs\u2019.[CITATION-85] When Cruger withdrew his candidacy in the 1780 election, Champion wrote triumphantly to Portland: \u2018The Neutrality of our friends must now convince him, how little he ought to have depended upon that vain Security, which made him act so treasonous a part\u2019.[CITATION-86] In 1784, however, Cruger was re-elected, several years after Champion had left Bristol.Champion\u2019s chief benefit from his connection with the Rockingham Whigs came in 1782 when the party returned to power in a brief administration. Burke was appointed Paymaster General (a position below Cabinet level) and named Champion his joint deputy together with his son Richard Burke Jr. However, the second Rockingham administration was even shorter-lived than the first one, as its leader died within three months of taking office. His demise split the ministry as Burke and many of Rockingham\u2019s followers resigned, refusing to serve under Shelburne. Under the new leadership of Portland in the Lords and Charles James Fox in the Commons, Burke\u2019s party, together with Lord North and his followers, brought down Shelburne\u2019s ministry the following year over the peace preliminaries which Shelburne had negotiated with the Americans. Burke and Champion returned to their previous offices in the Fox\u2013North coalition, and Portland\u2014the new torchbearer of aristocratic Whiggism\u2014was head of the Treasury.[CITATION-87] The Fox\u2013North coalition did not survive for much longer than the second Rockingham administration, being brought down by George III over regulation of the East India Company, with the king declaring that everyone voting for Fox\u2019s India Bill was his enemy.[CITATION-88] Even though Burke\u2019s plan to regulate the East India Company failed, he succeeded in carrying out at least some measures of \u2018economical reform\u2019\u2014the Rockingham Whigs\u2019 answer to the problem of the growing influence of the Crown\u2014with Champion as his deputy. The Civil List Act 1782 abolished a swathe of sinecures and court positions, the third secretary of state and the Board of Trade. It also regulated the monarch\u2019s household budget and transferred its management to the Treasury.[CITATION-89] However, Champion\u2019s own period in government, and his relationship with Burke, ended ingloriously. Champion borrowed money from someone who had been under indictment when Burke as Paymaster General reinstated this lender to office. When Burke found out he was furious because it looked as if he had done a dishonest favour for Champion.[CITATION-90] Champion\u2019s precarious financial situation made him take up a project he had considered since at least 1780: emigration to America.[CITATION-91] Burke never again corresponded with Champion after his emigration in 1784, as Burke stressed in a letter in 1791, although his close friend and collaborator William Burke did.[CITATION-92] Champion settled in Camden, South Carolina, became a naturalised American citizen and served briefly in the state assembly.[CITATION-93] In the same year he left Britain, Champion publishedwith the chief intention of proposing a method to settle \u2018the American Trade upon a liberal foundation\u2019 after American independence.[CITATION-94] The pamphlet is a forceful defence of free trade, imploring Britain not to impede the economic development of America and instead to seek to extend the two countries\u2019 commercial interactions: \u2018the more the wealth of the countries, with whom we have this particular [economic] connexion, increases, the more will flow into Great Britain\u2019.[CITATION-95] It further shows that Champion was certainly not an implacable constitutional conservative. \u2018[T]he various revolutions in our national interests have made it useful, necessary, and prudent, to make alterations in the great law of our Constitution\u2019, he wrote. \u2018And the late revolution in our commercial interests has made it equally useful, necessary, and prudent, to make alterations in the great law of our Navigation\u2019.[CITATION-96] In short, he believed that a commercial treaty could re-unite Britain and America.Champion stressed in the pamphlet that Britain need not be terrified by the prospect of mass emigration. As if to justify his own relocation in advance, he stressed that \u2018those only will emigrate, who either have not a sufficiency to make them easy, or being disgusted by disappointments, are uncomfortable at home: Or the idle, and dissolute, who are burthensome to the community\u2019.[CITATION-97] On the back of the fall of the Fox\u2013North coalition and the installation of the ministry of William Pitt the Younger, coupled with his own financial difficulties since the beginning of the American War, Champion belonged to the first category. Such emigration could be beneficial to the mother country, he stressed: \u2018whilst they quicken the diligence of those who remain behind, carry with them the name of Englishmen to the remotest parts; where the Estates which they create, will be entailed with their language and manners, upon their posterity; forming an Union that will last for ages\u2019.[CITATION-98] He changed his views on this topic in his next work. On board the ship to America he began drafting hiswhich was published in 1787. He wrote:It is a happiness, which is the envied lot of English Whigs, that there is a country, inhabited by Englishmen once fellow subjects, and always dear to them, where the laws, the language, and the manners, will preserve constantly in her remembrance, the state of their native country in her best days.[CITATION-99] Because of the \u2018deranged\u2019 condition of Britain, he now argued that \u2018great emigration\u2019 was highly probable.[CITATION-100] The final sections of this article will explain why Champion thought this was the case.Champion\u2019s political writings have received little attention from historians. D.M. Olsen\u2019s otherwise impressive biographical sketch of Champion does not mention his first extensive pamphlet and calls his second book \u2018a set of rambling letters\u2019.[CITATION-101] However, as an outline of Champion\u2019s political principles, and as an exposition of the political creed of the Rockingham Whigs, theis a highly valuable document. The work was indebted to Burke\u2019swhich Champion had borrowed from the Bristol Library Society for six days in October 1775.[CITATION-102] In the second, extended edition of his earlier, Champion had named Burke as a key influence.[CITATION-103] In the second work, written after their separation, he even proposed Burke as new leader of the former Rockingham Whig connection and a plausible candidate for \u2018prime minister\u2019, which was most unrealistic because of Burke\u2019s low rank and lack of family pedigree.[CITATION-104] However, we should not regard theas a simple regurgitation of Burke\u2019s views. As we shall see, instead of directly quoting Burke, Champion twice cited Burke\u2019s old intellectual opposite, Henry St John, first Viscount Bolingbroke.In the, Champion argued that the crisis in British politics was entirely due to the \u2018system of government\u2019 of empowering the Crown, originally conceived by Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales (the mother of George III), and put into effect by Bute and George III on the latter\u2019s accession in 1760.[CITATION-105] Burke had termed this system of government the \u2018double cabinet\u2019.[CITATION-106] As a result of this new system of government, Champion asserted, almost every administration in George III\u2019s reign had been \u2018an heterogeneous mixture of debility and insolence, tyranny and corruption\u2019, with Rockingham\u2019s and Portland\u2019s brief ministries the only exceptions.[CITATION-107] He contrasted this new system with the old, which he called \u2018aristocratical government\u2019. This \u2018old system\u2019 was \u2018maintained by a combination of the whole of the landed property, and all the great family interests of the Whigs, as well as by the principal monied men\u2019.[CITATION-108] Under this system:[t]he Administration was selected from the principal Whig families, who all concurred in the support of the person placed at the head of the Treasury, to whom they were generally united by long habits of attachment. All the other officers were made properly subordinate to, and dependent upon, his department. They yielded to him the rank of first minister, and shewed an example to their fellow subjects in the deference and respect which they paid to him.Since the monarch did not have any direct power in his or her person, \u2018that excellent maxim in the Constitution, \u201cthe King can do no wrong,\u201d was holden [] sacred\u2019. The first minister\u2014Champion\u2019s models were clearly Walpole and Pelham\u2014was then held responsible for all measures of government, and \u2018grounded his strength upon a majority in the House of Commons\u2019.[CITATION-109] The old system presupposed a strong opposition as a necessary control on the government, and it was the parliamentary opposition, rather than the monarch, which could overthrow an administration.[CITATION-110] Because of the Jacobite leanings of the Tories, the Hanoverian monarchs were compelled to put their faith exclusively in the Whigs, and were thus obliged to diminish their own personal power.[CITATION-111] Champion highlighted that this circumscription of royal power coincided with the most prosperous period in Britain\u2019s history.[CITATION-112] One of the difficulties of this Whig interpretation of Hanoverian politics is to square the alleged triumph of Tory principles under George III with the disappearance of the Tory party as a coherent parliamentary bloc at around the same time. The country gentlemen rump of those who remained Tories tended to support George III\u2019s governments, but not indiscriminately, and some of them sided with the opposition on questions such as the cider tax, general warrants and even the dispute over seating Wilkes as MP for Middlesex. Roger Newdigate, MP for Oxford University, wrote: \u2018I like the King and shall be with his ministers as long as I think an honest man ought, and believe it best not to lose the country gentleman in the courtier\u2019.[CITATION-113] Champion had accused the North administration of being Tory, but the key point was that North had pursued Tory policies which were supported by old Tories in the shape of the Steadfast Society in Bristol.[CITATION-114] As he wrote, \u2018The Whigs, having been in possession of the administration for near fifty years, were so much masters of the elections, that, notwithstanding almost all the Parliaments of this reign have acted in obedience to the new system they have consisted\u2019.[CITATION-115] George III was persuaded that extinguishing the great Whig families would open the door to talents who had previously been excluded from government.[CITATION-116] In the wake of his accession, connections were broken and \u2018[d]esertion from party became frequent\u2019.[CITATION-117] Only the friends of Rockingham remained united, amounting to seventy or eighty members in Champion\u2019s estimation. Moreover, the opposition to the American war was restricted to Rockingham\u2019s party, according to Champion, who had privately lamented that Chatham did not act consistently in concert with the Rockingham Whigs.[CITATION-118] Parliament was dominated by the \u2018King\u2019s friends\u2019, supported by the Bristol Tories. For Champion, the aristocratic Whig system\u2014whereby the monarch was a mere figurehead of government and his or her business was carried out by ministers of birth, wealth and weight, fully attuned to the opinion of Britain\u2019s trading and manufacturing interests\u2014was thus a counterweight to the new system of government which had triumphed since George III\u2019s accession. Paradoxically, the aristocratic Whig system had the ability to ensure that the popular element of the constitution retained the upper hand against the monarchy, without becoming all-powerful: \u2018It is the especial duty of ministers, acting upon Whig principles, in this limited monarchy, and who are responsible, not so much to the sovereign as to the people,to address a king with truth, simplicity, and firmness\u2019.[CITATION-119] In short, a powerful, independent aristocracy was the solution to the general political crisis identified by Champion, and people should rally behind this form of true Whiggism, rather than the \u2018wild popularity\u2019 of Wilkes and Cruger, and the politics of reform and agitation.One of the characteristics of Champion\u2019s politics is its rather austere nature, which is understandable considering his Quaker background, but is not what is usually associated with either the Rockingham Whigs or with Britain\u2019s commercial cities.[CITATION-120] He complained,, that \u2018[o]ur eating formerly, though equally plentiful, was much plainer and cheaper\u2019.[CITATION-121] Like John Brown\u2019s best-selling(2 vols, 1757/8), Champion diagnosed a decline in British manners, although he believed it to be a more recent phenomenon than Brown had claimed.[CITATION-122] \u2018The change of living within these last twenty years has produced an entire change of manners\u2019, Champion wrote: \u2018Their natural jealousy, susceptible of the smallest national affront, has totally forsaken them\u2019.[CITATION-123] As we have seen, Champion had complained about the inactivity and lethargy of the people for much of the 1770s in his correspondence with the Whig leaders. He now suggested that it was due to the spectre of luxury, which he appears to have understood conventionally as excessive individual consumption.[CITATION-124] The similarity between Champion and Brown should not be overstressed, since the latter blamed the era of aristocratic government and the Whig supremacy under the first two Georges, which Champion celebrated as an age of commercial prosperity and constitutional equilibrium. But their common ground went beyond mere rhetoric. For both, luxury symbolised what was wrong with modern Britain. In private, Champion called luxury \u2018the greatest evil in a growing State\u2019.[CITATION-125] At the start of the Seven Years War, the general conduct of the nation had been \u2018manly\u2019 (that is, virtuous), but after the influx of wealth in the wake of this successful imperial war, manners changed markedly. The central problem was Britain\u2019s transformed position on the Indian subcontinent. In this context, Champion undoubtedly drew on the expertise of Burke, whom he had served when Burke had delivered his famous speech on Fox\u2019s East India Bill in 1783.[CITATION-126] Champion singled out the Battle of Plassey of 1757 as the transformative event which had turned the East India Company into a sovereign power.[CITATION-127] From this time on, Champion stressed that \u2018the greater part of their servants acted no longer in the station of traders\u2019.[CITATION-128] This had far-reaching consequences, not only for India but also for the British metropole:Happy would it be for a people, could the distribution of its riches be confined within proper bounds! But such were the effects of the plunder of the East in corrupting our manners, that we very soon made a rapid stride from the laudable improvements to the most corrupt and licentious conduct.[CITATION-129] The return of wealthy Company servants (the so-called \u2018nabobs\u2019) to England could see them overthrow the influence of the traditional aristocracy, as, for example, when Lord Ilchester and Lord Shaftesbury found it too expensive to hold onto their electoral interest in Shaftesbury after 1771.[CITATION-130] For Champion and Brown alike, patriotism\u2014understood as selfless devotion to the common good\u2014was the antidote to the corrupting influence of new wealth. The one-time Tory and Country party spokesperson, Bolingbroke, had popularised this term in his opposition to Walpole in the 1720s and 1730s, when he wrote his \u2018Letter On the Spirit of Patriotism\u2019 (1736) and(1738). David Armitage has traced the persistent influence of Bolingbroke in reformist circles.[CITATION-131] It is equally clear that his writings retained their standing among more moderate Whigs such as Champion, even though Burke had begun his writing career as a satirist of Bolingbroke.[CITATION-132] In, Champion cited Bolingbroke\u2019s, which had been serialised in thein 1733\u20134, in the epigraphs to two key chapters dealing with the national debt and \u2018the state and principles of the different parties\u2019, respectively. In the first case, he quoted Bolingbroke\u2019s warning that the public debt had increased the power of the Crown and the potential for parliamentary corruption, and in the latter a more general complaint about \u2018universal corruption\u2019.[CITATION-133] Champion\u2019s citations underline that Burke\u2019s later condemnation\u2014\u2018Who now reads Bolingbroke? Who ever read him through?\u2019[CITATION-134] \u2014referred only to Bolingbroke\u2019s philosophical and religious writings: his political writings continued to be widely read.The wealth of modern Britain was \u2018superficial\u2019 because so much of it was fuelled by debt, complained Champion, who was not above railing against the \u2018the merciless fangs of the monied man\u2019 in a Bolingbrokean manner.[CITATION-135] Burke later adopted the same language in the(1790).[CITATION-136] The \u2018Country\u2019 and \u2018Patriot\u2019 framework fits with Champion\u2019s diagnosis of Britain\u2019s ills as resulting from excessive indebtedness, public as well as private. The national debt had perhaps been temporarily beneficial when the Jacobite threat was still potent, according to Champion, but in the long run, it had been positively injurious: under the system of perpetual debt financing, Britain\u2019s manufacturers and merchants were burdened \u2018with taxes to maintain a vast body of idle people, who live upon the labour of the hive\u2019.[CITATION-137] In short, Champion regarded the monied interest as \u2018a dead weight upon the community at large\u2019.[CITATION-138] After Bolingbroke, patriotism became synonymous with constitutional opposition to government, and was chiefly associated with the Country party platform which opposed the increasingly centralised and powerful British state, financed by the national debt.[CITATION-139] The Rockingham Whigs self-evidently had Court Whig roots, but as a long-standing opposition party they had resorted to Country party arguments and tactics.[CITATION-140] This explains at least partly why some of those previously classed as Country Tories became associated with the Rockingham Whigs, including Sir William Meredith and William Dowdeswell, as well as independent Country politicians such as Sir George Savile.[CITATION-141] It also clarifies why some associated Burke with Bolingbroke, despite Burke\u2019s own dislike of the Tory statesman-cum-philosopher. When the bookseller Thomas Davies published a new edition of Bolingbroke\u2019s political writings in 1775, he dedicated the work to Burke. Davies associated patriotism with constitutional opposition in the context of fears about the growing powers of the Crown, as well as public protests. \u2018A British Senator, like you, will not flatter either Prince or People: he only is a true Friend to both, who supports, to the utmost of his power, the prerogative of the crown, and the rights of the people, as they are fixed by the laws of the land\u2019, he concluded his dedication.[CITATION-142] For Burke and the Rockingham Whigs, \u2018economical reform\u2019\u2014intended to make the legislature more independent of the executive\u2014was a more suitable undertaking than political reform.For Champion, it did not appear contradictory to promote commercial development and free trade while bemoaning the nefarious influence of luxury, despite his own professional background in high-end manufacturing, illustrated by the tea service he gave to Burke\u2019s wife. The Quakers\u2019 heavy investment in tea and chocolate products, as drunk from Champion\u2019s porcelain, was intended to provide an alternative to alcohol with its dangerous effects. Moreover, producing domestic porcelain could reduce dependence on imports from the East which swelled the East India Company\u2019s profits (though the tea they also drank undermined this ambition). Quaker attempts to square modern politeness with frugality were further reflected in the split in their ranks over the theatre in Bristol, which many of them viewed as a frivolous amusement. As Olsen has shown, previous scholars, by confusing Champion with his uncle, wrongly assumed that he campaigned against the opening of a theatre in the city in the 1760s, when he may in fact have been involved in the establishment of one along with his fellow Quaker Joseph Harford. But in 1773, possibly under pressure from the Society of Friends, he did organise a petition to prevent the licensing of a new theatre in the city.[CITATION-143] In any case, Champion would have disagreed with Bernard Mandeville, for whom it was impossible to cultivate both frugality and the arts and sciences.[CITATION-144] Champion was worried that the possession of luxury led to contentment and could retard the industriousness which enabled prosperity. His pamphlet on American trade shows his acute concerns about the prospect of economic decline in a sweeping and largely inaccurate world-historical perspective: \u2018We are wearied with the desolation of the rich and beautiful regions of Asia, and of the East, so full of people in ancient times, but now almost depopulated by their ferocious Masters\u2019.[CITATION-145] In the same pamphlet, he warned that the young American republic \u2018ought to be founded in examples of frugality, not of luxurious enjoyments\u2019.[CITATION-146] But this did not stop him claiming that Britain could profit from trade if the Americans pursued superfluities rather than necessities.[CITATION-147] For all his enlightenment, Champion thus suggested that trade in luxuries could be a zero-sum game in which the seller was the evident beneficiary. Betraying the influence of Montesquieu\u2019s terminology, Champion argued that luxury was more pernicious in a republic, which needed virtue, than in an absolute monarchy, in which honour was the ruling principle.[CITATION-148] In general, however, Champion\u2019s ideas were part of the second \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 debate among \u2018moderns\u2019 about luxury, between the partisans of \u2018unregulated\u2019 and those of \u2018well-ordered\u2019 luxury, siding with the latter camp.[CITATION-149] He did not think that virtuous states needed to be poor. Champion paid lip service to a fundamental distinction between modern and ancient people\u2014a notion Benjamin Constant would immortalise in the following century\u2014describing the latter as more \u2018sanguinary\u2019 and \u2018dissolute\u2019, and motivated by \u2018a spirit of conquest\u2019.[CITATION-150] For Champion, the \u2018mildness of Christianity\u2019 had transformed modern people. Yet, he stressed that the parallel of the fall of Rome remained instructive: \u2018Rome was then, what Great Britain is now, in a very willing disposition to receive a master\u2019.[CITATION-151] Britain\u2019s activities in India demonstrated that the influx of Eastern luxury was founded on \u2018ferocious conquest\u2019 in Bengal rather than.[CITATION-152] London could thus be compared with Rome at its sacking, but rather than barbarian invaders, the threat came from \u2018domestic and civil commotions\u2019, illustrated by the Gordon Riots in 1780. \u2018Had not the military arrived at the very instant in which their fate seemed to be suspended in a doubtful balance, the great and opulent city of London would most probably have been plundered and destroyed\u2019, Champion reflected.[CITATION-153] In summary, the aristocratic Whig and Country party traditions were blended in Champion\u2019s politics under the joint influence of Burke and Bolingbroke, with a tinge of the austerity and pessimism chiefly associated with John \u2018Estimate\u2019 Brown. Champion\u2019s political writings thus exemplify that the dialectic between virtue and corruption was often left unresolved in eighteenth-century political discourse.This article has demonstrated that Champion provides a useful case-study for investigating the interactions between local and national politics in Britain in the second half of the eighteenth century. Through his links with Burke, as well as his lesser-known interactions with Rockingham and Portland, and through his nearly forgotten pamphlets on politics and political economy, he furnishes a noteworthy example that demonstrates the importance of analysing politics under George III beyond the radical\u2013conservative dichotomy.[CITATION-154] Champion\u2019s career shows that one dimension of the post-1760 political landscape can be understood as aristocratic Whiggism in opposition to the dual threat of George III and his ministers on the one hand, and the growing political reform movement on the other. These political strands represented three competing readings of Britain\u2019s mixed and balanced constitution, one dominated by party and the aristocracy, one Court-centred and one concentrated on the people. All of them claimed to uphold the integrity of the constitution\u2014with reformers clinging onto ancient constitutionalism[CITATION-155] \u2014but they disagreed on how the mixture and equilibrium in the constitution should be interpreted and protected.Namierite historians have dismissed the notion that George III was a constitutional innovator as a figment of Burke\u2019s imagination, which became an obsession of the Rockinghamites.[CITATION-156] Shifting attention away from the Rockingham Whigs, James Vaughn has recently observed in a learned and valuable study that the general trend of \u2018New Toryism\u2019 was only \u2018briefly interrupted in July 1766 with the formation of the Chatham administration\u2019, the government which succeeded Rockingham\u2019s.[CITATION-157] But for Champion, the real interruption took place with the formation of the Rockingham administration in 1765. In contrast with Vaughn\u2019s interpretation, Champion believed that the Chatham administration completed the Tory victory, since it split the Whigs. The anti-party \u2018not men, but measures\u2019 catchphrase of Chatham produced, in the words of Burke, an administrationso checkered and so speckled; he put together a piece of joinery, so crossly indented and whimsically dovetailed; a cabinet so variously inlaid; such a piece of diversified Mosaic; such a tesselated pavement without cement; here a bit of black stone, and there a bit of white; patriots and courtiers, kings friends and republicans; whigs and tories; treacherous friends and open enemies \u2026 indeed a very curious show; but utterly unsafe to touch, and unsure to stand on.[CITATION-158] In some ways, then, the case of Champion confirms certain aspects of the Whig interpretation of eighteenth-century politics, and this article has shown that private correspondence between party leaders such as Rockingham and Portland and local agents such as Champion can reinforce the Whig history of party as well as destabilise it. Champion\u2019s published works in the 1780s reiterated and crystallised themes he had written about in his political correspondence for over a decade. This does not mean that the Whig interpretation of eighteenth-century politics captures. It is merely one perspective, and an ideologically charged one. But while modern research has demolished the notion of a revived Tory party at the national level after the accession of George III, the label had greater resilience in certain localities.[CITATION-159] Most importantly, the idea of a revived Tory party was vital to theof many Whigs, both nationally and locally, and is better understood as the partisan perspective of the vanquished rather than pure mythology.[CITATION-160] Champion\u2019s viewpoint illustrates that aristocratic Whiggism remained a plausible ideology among Protestant Dissenters and merchants in one of Britain\u2019s major commercial cities in the latter decades of the eighteenth century. This provides an important qualification to much of the historiography, which tends to emphasise the egalitarian nature of non-conformity.[CITATION-161] In general, historical studies are inclined to focus on extremes rather than the middle ground.[CITATION-162] Champion may be a single example, and sometimes an idiosyncratic one, but his connections and relative articulacy make him a highly interesting case-study. It shows that the alleged failure of the Rockingham connection to develop a positive ideology which appealed beyond the parliamentary cadre was not as complete as the Namierites believed.[CITATION-163] Thanks to the politics of people such as Champion, this form of aristocratic Whiggism was not extinguished. The call for reform within the Whig family certainly started to make itself felt in the 1760s and 1770s, reflected by the Rockinghamites\u2019 espousal of \u2018economical reform\u2019. John Brooke argued that Burke\u2019s failure at the polls in 1780 demonstrates the electoral weakness of aristocratic Whiggism.[CITATION-164] Champion\u2019s failure to activate the Whigs in Bristol confirms this view to an extent. However, aristocratic Whiggism continued to be the focus of the parliamentary opposition, and the hope of prominent Whigs in Bristol, as represented by Champion. In the years of opposition after 1784, following Champion\u2019s emigration to America, the Portland Whigs, despite losing the support of the Bristolian Union Club in 1784, had more supporters in parliament than the Rockingham Whigs had had. After the election of 1790, approximately 145 MPs out of 183 members of the opposition belonged to the Portland\u2013Fox connection.[CITATION-165] The French Revolution split the \u2018old Whigs\u2019, initially via the division between Burke and Fox in 1791, later by William Windham\u2019s breakaway \u2018Third Party\u2019, and then decisively when the Portland Whigs entered into a coalition with Pitt in 1794.[CITATION-166] While nineteenth-century Whigs lamented the split between Fox and Burke, and Fox became synonymous with Whiggism, they continued to regard Burke as providing the intellectual foundations for the still-important ideal of aristocratic independence under the banner of the Whig party.[CITATION-167] Champion shows that the idea of an aristocratic party could resonate beyond the nobility, since it rested on a theory of politics to which many commercial Dissenters were wedded.Finally, what does this tell us about Namier\u2019s \u2018political nation\u2019 with which this article began? While Champion personifies the resilience of aristocratic ideals, and to some extent confirms part of the hierarchical framework associated with J.C.D. Clark\u2019s revisionism,[CITATION-168] he also encourages us to think about these ideals as more eclectic and surprisingly inclusive in ways that chime with much of the finest British political historiography of recent years.[CITATION-169] Above all, his political and intellectual life is testimony to the value of investigating the past through the prism of ordinary people\u2019s experiences and outlooks."

    "title": "Comfort Eating: Food, Drink and Emotional Health in Early Modern England*",
    "author": "Rachel Winchcombe",

    "text": "This article explores early modern practices of \u2018comfort eating\u2019, arguing that they represent a crucial dimension of early modern preventative healthcare. The article argues that ideas of comfort eating were shaped not only by medical understandings of the composition of foods and their impact on the body, particularly on the levels of the four humours, but also by the cultural and social significance of certain foods, along with when, where, and with whom they were eaten. For early modern people, whether a food could provide comfort depended on its perceived medical properties, the quantities in which it was eaten, its social capital, and its use in other areas of daily life that were known to promote cheerfulness such as sharing meals and gift-giving. Focusing on this more holistic approach to emotional healthcare reveals how practices that have normally been defined as largely social in nature, such as gift-giving and hospitality, were viewed and performed through a medical lens, while also demonstrating how techniques for managing the passions seeped into everyday experiences of food consumption and culture. Practices of comfort eating represented a critical tool with which early modern people could manage their emotional health and the health of their wider communities, empowering them to adapt their diets where necessary, create medicines that could cure diseases of the passions, and consider how everyday social codes of hospitality and commensality could have medical implications for the health of their passions.On 10 September 1689, Anne Dormer, an unhappily married gentlewoman, wrote to her sister Elizabeth detailing her many woes and emotional hardships. She described how \u2018so many grievous passages\u2019 had happened to her since she was last happy, with her only comfort now being the love and joy of her family, friends and children. Dormer recognised that her natural temperament inclined towards \u2018dejection\u2019 and that this had an impact on her physical health, causing her \u2018greate want of sleepe\u2019 and \u2018vapours\u2019 around the spleen. Dormer, however, did not reconcile herself to this state of misery and ill health. In her letter, she outlined strategies she used to combat her sadness. As well as diverting her attention to the care of her \u2018sweet children\u2019, she altered her diet in a bid to raise her spirits. She told her sister how she found \u2018a dish of chocolate\u2019 to be the \u2018greatest cordiall ... in the world\u2019 for her condition.[CITATION-1] This article explores the early modern connections between emotional health and eating to which Dormer\u2019s consumption of chocolate alludes\u2014connections that have thus far received scant historical analysis. Rather than just being a particular food preference, chocolate was known as a foodstuff that could stimulate feelings of joy and happiness while suppressing those of grief and sadness. Henry Stubbes, an English physician who extolled the virtues of chocolate in print, claimed that nothing freed the body of superfluous humours better. Chocolate, so Stubbes argued, \u2018chears the Spirits, begets good Blood, and opens all the Emunctories of the body\u2019.[CITATION-2] Anne Dormer took chocolate to safeguard her emotional health, believing that it would provide her with comfort and help stir more positive passions, such as cheerfulness, while banishing her unhappiness.Dormer\u2019s conceptualisation of chocolate as comforting is just one example of many that demonstrate that \u2018comfort eating\u2019 was a prominent feature of early modern preventative healthcare. This article examines the notion of comforting foods and practices of comfort eating in early modern England and engages with and builds on histories of the body, emotions, food and medicine. It argues for a culturally and historically specific concept of comfort eating, which differs substantially from modern definitions. While the primary function of eating was to allay hunger, comfort eating was practised to alleviate anxiety and promote happiness. Foods that were deemed comforting\u2014that is, foods that had the ability to ease discomfort, which was characterised by feelings of sorrow, as well as, at times, by physical distress\u2014were often distinguished by certain properties that engendered particular bodily sensations, such as satisfaction and pleasure, and helped balance other substances in the body, including the four humours.[CITATION-3] Because of the early modern body\u2019s material fluidity, the passions were constantly in danger of disruption, meaning people had to invest daily labour, such as practices of comfort eating, in their management.[CITATION-4] Unlike modern definitions of comfort eating, which emphasise sentimentality and nostalgia in comfort-food selection, comfort eating in the early modern period, as this article argues, aimed to instigate a set of exchanges between the body and its material components and the passions, which were themselves experienced as highly embodied.[CITATION-5] The early modern passions are distinct from what we might define as \u2018emotions\u2019 today.[CITATION-6] While both terms are often applied to an intuitive set of feelings that are commonly distinguished from \u2018reason\u2019, it is important to set out the particularities of the passions and how they related to corporeality, health and bodily control. The early modern passions were understood as originating in physiological changes and were believed to play an important role in the onset of disease. This article employs the term \u2018emotional health\u2019 to distinguish early modern healthcare practices relating to intense feelings, such as anger, love and grief, and the diseases associated with such strong passions, from those aimed at other bodily functions and illnesses. Emotional health and the pursuit of comfort from an early modern perspective are thus intricately tied to bodily physiology and pathology.The article makes two main arguments. First, that the relationship between comfort eating and emotional health was not shaped only by medical understandings of the composition of foods and their impact on the body, particularly on the levels of the four humours; and secondly, that individuals incorporated dietary advice on regulating the passions into their everyday social engagements with food. Although the physical properties of foodstuffs were crucial for determining their emotional health benefits, the cultural and social significance of certain foods, along with when, where and with whom they were eaten, was no less important. The belief that food had the power to comfort and tame the passions influenced how people gifted foods, how they perceived the medical benefits of the ubiquitous practices of hospitality and commensality, and how they attempted to relieve their and their loved ones\u2019 negative passions at moments of emotional crisis. The article draws on anthropological studies of embodiment to demonstrate the role played by the body in creating emotional experiences and how early modern protagonists considered comfort-eating practices to be crucial for the nurturing and care of the self, as well as the wider community.[CITATION-7] As a daily experience, comfort eating was thus highly embodied. This article has important implications for the histories of medicine, food and embodied emotions, arguing that comfort eating formed a significant dimension of early modern preventative healthcare that was embedded in daily life and modes of sociability, and was used as a practical, holistic tool to manage and safeguard emotional health.The management of the passions was intricately tied to ideas about food consumption in the early modern period. As this article argues, food habits and dietary practices were used in a variety of ways to help maintain good emotional health, from the creation of medicaments using specific ingredients to help combat diseases of the passions, to consuming certain foods that were known to alleviate unwanted passions and stimulate joy and good cheer. The links between the passions and bodily health have received extensive scholarly attention, but the role played by food in the regulation of emotions and prevention of disorders of the passions remains largely unexplored. Elena Carrera, for example, has situated the passions within broader medieval and early modern understandings of health and disease, demonstrating that health was characterised in this period by both a \u2018lively body and cheerful mind\u2019 and that psychological disturbances, caused by disordered passions, could result in bodily diseases.[CITATION-8] Similarly, Hannah Newton and Olivia Weisser have explored how the passions intersected with early modern experiences of physical illness. While positively construed passions, such as mirth, could signal that a person had been restored to bodily health, watching the agony of loved ones could cause an emotional response in the friends and family of patients which might lead them to fall ill in sympathy.[CITATION-9] Moving beyond this scholarship, this article locates the health of the passions in a broader framework of early modern preventative healthcare and analyses how early modern people attempted to control their passions through everyday comfort eating. Tessa Storey and Sandra Cavallo have demonstrated the importance of prevention for governing the passions and ensuring a healthy body. This could be achieved in a variety of ways: for example, theologians and physicians encouraged people to detach themselves through prayer and spiritual exercises from the worldly cares that could trigger the production of unwanted passions.[CITATION-10] Storey and Cavallo\u2019s intervention, although welcome, has served to separate the passions from other aspects of life that could impact emotional health. This is partly a result of Storey and Cavallo structuring their book around the six non-natural things\u2014the six spheres of life\u2014including air, food and drink, rest and exercise, sleep and waking, excretions and retentions, and the passions of the mind, that could impact the proper functioning of the body, but is also the result of a wider trend to examine these six non-naturals separately.[CITATION-11] Illnesses caused by disturbed passions could be managed through the careful regulation of all the six non-natural things. The \u2018passions\u2019 were both one of the six non-naturalsan internal bodily reaction. Unsurprisingly, the sixth non-natural known as the \u2018passions of the mind\u2019 was most closely connected to the production of bodily passions and the diseases associated with them. The \u2018passions of the mind\u2019, can, in their simplest form, be defined as the external social triggers and experiences that could lead to the creation of unwanted passions within the body and it is on this aspect of emotional health that scholars such as Storey and Cavallo have focused their attention.[CITATION-12] By examining practices of comfort eating, this article reveals the extent to which the health of the passions was also reliant on wider lifestyle decisions, including what a person ate on a daily basis.Of all the six non-naturals, diet has been the subject of the most detailed historical analysis. Numerous works have demonstrated the role played by food and drink in early modern conceptions of health and disease, but surprisingly little has been said about the role of diet in the regulation of the passions and the illnesses that they were believed to generate.[CITATION-13] This article argues that dietary management (by which I mean the intake of food and drink, rather than the more expansive early modern meaning that referred to the regulation of all the non-naturals) was critical to the health of the passions. Not only could food intake drastically alter the humoral balance of the body, and by extension the passions that an individual experienced, but foods that were considered comforting could spark the production of beneficial passions within the body, while suppressing those that were considered harmful. While Steven Shapin and Michael Schoenfeldt have made it clear in their work that a person\u2019s emotional make-up was in part determined by their diet, they do not discuss how this impacted people\u2019s daily experiences of food consumption.[CITATION-14] Likewise, although scholars have increasingly analysed the centrality of diet in shaping early modern notions of identity and subjectivity, notions which were themselves highly embodied and emotionally charged, the connections between eating and the health of the passions remain poorly understood.[CITATION-15] Some historians have begun to explore this relationship, including Erin Sullivan, who touches on the dietary causes and cures of melancholy in Renaissance England, and Ken Albala, who has considered the relationship between emotions, unbalanced humours and early modern diets, but this scholarship limits the discussion of diet and its role in governing the passions to how food impacted the four humours. Through an analysis of early modern approaches to comfort eating, this article argues that the connections between eating and the passions went far beyond a consideration of how certain foods impacted levels of the humours. How much food a person ate, and in what social contexts, was also crucial for maintaining the health of the passions.[CITATION-16] The article places people and their everyday healthcare practices under the microscope to show the variety of dietary strategies employed by early modern individuals to regulate their passions. As a number of historians have demonstrated, early modern men and women took an active interest in their health in times of sickness and wellness.[CITATION-17] They devised methods to prevent the onset of illness, they engaged with medical texts and other printed materials to dispense healthcare in the home, and they documented their efforts in letters and diaries.[CITATION-18] This scholarship has largely focused on patient-centred narratives of bodily health, but this article shows that the same kinds of concerns can be identified in material relating to disorderly passions. By examining early modern approaches to comfort eating, the article demonstrates that comfort foods are not universal but historically contingent.[CITATION-19] For early modern people, whether a food could provide comfort depended on its perceived medical properties, the quantities in which it was eaten, its social capital and its use in other areas of daily life that were known to promote cheerfulness, such as sharing meals and gift-giving. Focusing on this more holistic approach to emotional healthcare reveals how practices that have normally been defined as largely social in nature, such as gift-giving and hospitality, were viewed and performed through a medical lens, while also demonstrating how techniques for managing the passions seeped into everyday experiences of food consumption and culture.[CITATION-20] This article draws on a range of sources from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, including medical casebooks, printed medical treatises and moralistic texts that set out what the passions were and how they could be managed; and manuscript recipe books, letters and diaries that illuminate how people attempted to control their passions through what they ate. This was a period in which Galenic medicine and preventative healthcare were still dominant, both in medical and non-medical circles. It was also in these centuries that printed texts such as vernacular health regimens and herbals, which set out the properties and uses of various plants, became more widespread, being read by a broader, literate cross-section of society. This collection of source material does, however, have certain drawbacks. The manuscript sources that are used largely reflect the views and practices of a particular social group, namely men and women of reasonable means who could afford to buy the ingredients necessary to make their own recipes and who had the time and skills to document their health concerns in written form. Although penned by literate individuals of mostly elite and middling backgrounds, manuscript sources like recipe books reflect the collective knowledge of a wider range of individuals, such as gardeners, cooks and maids, who would have been involved in the creation and administration of such medicines. Individual recipes and medicines would probably also have been shared with the wider community through charitable giving and philanthropy.[CITATION-21] This material, then, offers an important glimpse of dietary practices aimed at managing the health of the passions and of how some men and women understood complex theories of the passions and incorporated them into their everyday healthcare practices.The article begins by outlining what the passions were and how they were connected to prevailing theories of the body, ideas about food and drink, and notions of comfort. It then considers how early modern women and men sought to protect their passions through strict regimens that had the generation of comfort at their centre and that inflected everyday social engagements with food. The article concludes by examining how early modern people treated disorders of the passions once they took hold, arguing that individuals harnessed their knowledge of the natural world, and of how their bodies worked, to create medicaments aimed at eradicating disorders and restoring the body to health. This section focuses on diseases such as melancholy and disorders of the heart, because of both the prevalence of manuscript recipes to counteract them and the apparent ubiquity of these illnesses in written accounts of the period, from diaries and letters to learned medical texts. By demonstrating that comfort eating was a widespread healthcare practice, this article highlights the breadth and intricacy of early modern preventative medicine and illustrates the ways in which it intersected with daily life, sociability and everyday experiences of food consumption.Diet, physical health and the passions were intrinsically linked in the early modern humoral medical framework. The early modern body was not a closed system, but one which interacted with the world it inhabited and was highly attentive to bodily fluids and juices, and particularly to their motions, interruptions and balances.[CITATION-22] It was within this open system of humoral juices, material spirits and bodily porosity that understandings of the passions were situated. In Edward Grimeston\u2019s English translation of the French theologian Nicolas Coeffeteau\u2019s, the passions were defined as motions of the sensitive soul, \u2018caused by the apprehension or imagination of good or evill, the which is followed with a change or alteration in the body, contrary to the Lawes of Nature\u2019.[CITATION-23] The sensitive soul, located in the heart, was home to the vital spirits that controlled the passions and sensory perceptions. Similarly, Thomas Wright, an English Catholic priest and son of an apothecary, argued that the production of the passions was the result of externalities, whether good or bad, colliding with the body\u2019s materiality. Wright explained that for the passions to be stirred, an external object, whether good or bad, needed to be recognised by the imagination in the brain. This recognition would cause purer spirits to move from the brain to the heart. The heart would then react to the object and adjust the humours accordingly.[CITATION-24] It was this reaction in the heart, which triggered a range of other bodily alterations, that characterised early modern passions. For example, if a perceived object caused sadness, by evoking the memory of a deceased loved one, the heart reacted by drawing more black bile to it. The production of additional black bile, caused by the stirred passion of grief, then provoked other bodily changes. These symptoms, caused by the drying and cooling effects of superfluous black bile, could include pale and wrinkled skin, hollow eyes and light-headedness.[CITATION-25] Particular passions, as with the humours, embodied specific elemental qualities. As Wright suggested, \u2018if the heart be very hote, colde, moist, tender, cholericke; sooner, and more vehemently it is stirred to Passions thereunto proportioned\u2019.[CITATION-26] Too much heat around the heart could spark the fiery passion of anger, while an overly cold heart could provoke feelings of fear and grief. The passions, however, were neither intrinsically good nor bad. Context mattered, as did the strength of a particular passion at any given moment. Erin Sullivan has demonstrated the varied and complex cultural meanings and associations of melancholy and the related passions of sorrow and grief, for example, arguing that within certain contexts these feelings, which often had negative connotations, could also be construed as emotionally fulfilling and intellectually stimulating.[CITATION-27] Even emotions that are usually interpreted as positive today, such as happiness, could be deemed dangerous in certain circumstances. Excessive cheerfulness, for example, could signal a corrupt soul and a sinful nature. Isaac Archer, a Church of England clergyman, highlighted this when he resolved to be \u2018more serious\u2019 after his sister chastised him, telling him \u2018it was a sin to laugh and be merry\u2019.[CITATION-28] The production of the early modern passions, whether perceived as intellectually and spiritually helpful or as a hindrance to health, can be characterised as a \u2018cognitive-physiological event\u2019 that impacted the functioning of both the mind and the body, and was the result of changes to, and interactions with, other corporeal materials.[CITATION-29] Humours and passions were believed to be so intimately connected that Thomas Wright declared \u2018Passions ingender Humors, and Humors breede Passions\u2019.[CITATION-30] Diseases of the body could spring from agitated passions, and disorders of the passions, such as melancholy, anger, grief and lovesickness, could be the consequence of corrupted and unbalanced humours. While external events and experiences, characterised at the time as \u2018passions of the mind\u2019, often led to disordered emotions, the other non-naturals could also impact the regulation of the body\u2019s internal passions. Food and drink could perhaps most obviously provoke material changes to the body\u2019s internal workings, by promoting or inhibiting its humours, and thus had the potential to create a range of unwelcome passions. According to Robert Burton, who is best known for his encyclopaedic work on melancholy, diet, more than any of the other non-naturals, could harm human bodies as it is \u2018more materiall then the other, because it makes new matter\u2019.[CITATION-31] As Ken Albala has argued, one upset stomach could have \u2018resounding effects through every physiological function of the body\u2019 because the purity of the humours, and by extension of the spirits and the passions, was determined by the process of digestion. A bad \u2018concoction\u2019, the process by which food was heated and broken down in the stomach, could result in a corrupted chyle, or juice, that would then circulate to the organs and be converted into contaminated humours and spirits. These corrupt humours could then be agitated by the passions, which themselves travelled through the body via the disrupted vital spirits, resulting in emotional disorders with physiological symptoms.[CITATION-32] Foodstuffs mirrored the elemental qualities of the humours and the passions. Different foods were thus deemed suitable for distinct humoral complexions and for bolstering and hindering the production of the humours and passions. Cold, dry foods such as old beef and old cheese could create excess black bile and cause drying and cooling around the heart, resulting in the emotional disorder of melancholy. Hot, dry foods such as onions and pepper could overheat the heart and create an abundance of choler, which in turn could lead to the disordered passion of anger.[CITATION-33] Early modern physicians explained to their readers how a variety of ingredients and foodstuffs could impact the production of troublesome passions which, if left unchecked, could easily generate full-blown diseases. Thomas Elyot, in his popular health regimen, discussed in detail the causes and cures of sorrow, which he also dubbed \u2018heviness of mynde\u2019. According to Elyot, sorrow could be extremely dangerous, being a principal \u2018enneyme to lyfe\u2019. This was not due to the feeling of upset that sorrow caused the sufferer, but to the impact this passion had on the body\u2019s operations. Elyot suggested that sorrow \u2018exhausteth bothe naturall heate and moysture of the body\u2019 and was thus perilous.[CITATION-34] According to medical understandings of the humours, moisture and heat were crucial to life. As a person aged, they exhausted their body\u2019s natural heat and moisture. If this heat and moisture could no longer be replenished, death was inevitable. Dryness and coldness stopped the humours and spirits flowing and thus undermined the entire functioning of the human body.[CITATION-35] The passion of sorrow, then, removed vital heat and moisture from the body. This in turn led to other troubling symptoms. Sorrow could, for example, \u2018make the body leane, dulleth the wit, and darkneth the spirites\u2019, inhibiting reason, oppressing memory and even causing death.[CITATION-36] Identifying the cause and cure of such a deadly emotional disorder was thus imperative. Both Elyot\u2019s proposed causes and cures of sorrow were split into two categories, one of which he described as \u2018moral philosophie\u2019 and the other as \u2018the counsayle of physyke\u2019.[CITATION-37] Moral philosophy can be defined as the social causes and cures of emotional hardship. As Elyot explained, sorrow was often caused by betrayal, grief, unrequited love and financial worries. To prevent these everyday concerns and anxieties from turning into the pathological features of sorrow, Elyot encouraged his readers to turn to God and consider their good fortunes.[CITATION-38] These kinds of philosophical and spiritual cures were not necessarily enough to banish sorrow completely. The illness stemmed from humoral imbalance, particularly when \u2018the humoure of melancolye is brought out of temper\u2019, and could thus be corrected with the management of the six non-natural things. To rectify this humoral imbalance, Elyot advised sufferers to follow \u2018the counsayle of physyke\u2019 and \u2018imbrace all thynge that is delectable\u2019. This meant abstaining from the \u2018dayly eatyng of moch old befe or old mutton, hard chese\u2019, as well as a range of other foods that might increase melancholy, and instead eating foods that were \u2018temperatelye hotte, and therwith somewhat moyste, boyled rather than rosted, [and] lyght of dygestyon\u2019. These hot and moist foods, such as milk, fresh and warm from the udder, almonds and the yolks of \u2018rere [raw] egges\u2019, would help banish excess melancholy by drying and heating the body and would in turn cure the illness of sorrow.[CITATION-39] In the early modern period, then, there was a blurred boundary between foods and medicines. For disorders of the passions that had their origin in humoral imbalance, changes to diet were considered to be as beneficial as the removal of social stresses for eradicating negative emotional states.As the heart was the part of the body that kept the passions in check through the vital spirits, keeping it in good health was critical for emotional balance and bodily comfort. The Elizabethan diarist Lady Margaret Hoby noted how comfort, like the passions, was often felt in the heart. In an entry from January 1599, Hoby described how she was \u2018not well\u2019 which in turn caused the \u2018discomfort\u2019 of her heart.[CITATION-40] A lack of comfort was thus a bodily feeling that could be caused and exacerbated by ill health. The English physician Andrew Boorde also detailed the importance of the heart to good health, explaining how it was the organ that \u2018hath the first life in man, and is the last thing that doeth dye in man\u2019.[CITATION-41] In Boorde\u2019s discussion of a heart-based affliction known as \u2018cardiacke passion\u2019, it is clear that disruptions to this particular organ could have a dire impact on the passions and the wider bodily system. When a person suffered from \u2018the cardiacke passion\u2019 their heart became \u2018depressed and overcome with faintnesse\u2019. This illness would result in \u2018the heart trembling with heat\u2019, culminating in \u2018imbesilite or melancholy\u2019 and leaving the patient \u2018in feare, in dulnesse, and sorrow\u2019. As with Elyot\u2019s description of sorrow, Boorde suggested that \u2018cardiacke passion\u2019 stemmed from evil humours \u2018which be in the celles about the heart\u2019. This disorder was particularly associated with the corrupted hot humours of blood and choler. Boorde also suggested that this illness could be cured via both moral and medical means. He encouraged sufferers to \u2018use myrth and merry company and beware of pencifulnesse\u2019, while also using \u2018mace in all manner of meates\u2019.[CITATION-42] Early modern conceptions of the passions were rooted in the body\u2019s material operations; they were triggered by changes to the body\u2019s physiology, especially adaptations to levels of humours situated around the heart. The stirring of the passions could lead to corporeal disruption and leave the body in a state of discomfort, physical ill health and emotional turmoil. While the passions often became unbalanced through the poor regulation of the \u2018passions of the mind\u2019, they could also be disrupted by the other non-natural things, including diet. Because the passions and the humours were so intimately connected, foods that disrupted particular humours could in turn lead to unwanted, and often deadly, diseases of the passions, such as fear and sorrow. Because of this, eating foods that balanced the humours and comforted the passions was, as we shall see, an integral dimension of early modern preventative emotional healthcare and a powerful tool to ground, manage and alter the body\u2019s emotional health.In the early modern period, it was generally believed that long-term prevention, rather than short-term curative treatment, was the most reliable method for preserving physical and emotional health.[CITATION-43] Just as with the pursuit for bodily health, emotional stability was sought via a range of preventative healthcare measures, including comfort eating. Early modern practices of comfort eating reveal just how intricate and wide-ranging preventative healthcare could be. While people sought to provide comfort to their passions by eating certain foods that could elevate or depress particular humours, as scholars such as Albala and Sullivan have demonstrated, dietary approaches to the health of the passions also involved much more than merely providing balance to the humoral body.[CITATION-44] As well as considering the elemental qualities of certain foods and how they might promote or inhibit the production of certain passions, women and men also paid close attention to the quantity of food they ate, who they ate it with, and the wider cultural resonances of certain foods and food practices. Understandings of what constituted a comforting diet inflected people\u2019s everyday social engagement with food, encouraging the gifting of foods that promoted balance and good health, and the sociable sharing of food that sparked feelings of cheerfulness, which was itself crucial to good emotional health. How individuals sought to protect the health of their passions through diet illuminates the extent to which medical understandings were subsumed into broader social routines, and how emotional health was dependent on a much wider range of food practices than has previously been recognised.Perhaps the most common early modern disease of the passions was melancholy.[CITATION-45] Melancholy was considered so dangerous because it took several forms, and thus had a range of causes and cures. It was a condition that could be passed down through a family, cast into bodies by witches, or the result of a poor diet.[CITATION-46] A range of foods was believed to engender the gross blood that often resulted in melancholy. Beef and pork were particularly dangerous for those that \u2018live at ease\u2019, only being suitable for those of a \u2018strong constitution\u2019, such as \u2018labouring men\u2019.[CITATION-47] Venison and red deer were also believed to cause melancholy, begetting \u2018bad blood\u2019 and yielding \u2018gross nutriment\u2019.[CITATION-48] These heavy, \u2018gross\u2019 meats were difficult to digest and, as has already been noted, poor digestion could lead to the creation of corrupted chyle, humours, spirits and passions. Old milk, cheese and butter could also increase the chances of developing melancholy, as could a number of vegetables. Cabbages were believed to be particularly harmful, causing \u2018troublesome dreames\u2019, sending up \u2018blacke vapors to the braine\u2019 and bringing \u2018heavinesse to the soule\u2019.[CITATION-49] How you prepared food could also increase your risk of developing the disease. Robert Burton advised avoiding foods that were \u2018fryed and broyled\u2019, sauces that were sharp or overly sweet, and anything made into a fritter, pancake, pie or sausage.[CITATION-50] Early modern protagonists could also find additional advice on what to eat to avoid the ubiquitous disorder of melancholy in more general works on health, and in herbals that examined the properties of various plants, how they could be cultivated and sourced, and their medical application.[CITATION-51] In a similar vein to Burton, English physicians and medical commentators, such as Thomas Elyot, Andrew Boorde, William Bullein and Thomas Cogan, all recommended avoiding certain foods to keep melancholy at bay. Boorde, when detailing the potential remedies for the illness, placed being aware of \u2018melancholy meats\u2019 at the top of his list.[CITATION-52] Agreeing with Burton, and providing a more detailed explanation as to why certain foods caused melancholy, all four physicians advised readers to avoid meats that were difficult to digest because they were known to \u2018ingender melancholy\u2019.[CITATION-53] Nuancing his advice, Bullein noted that the negative characteristics of these gross meats could be mitigated by methods of preparation. He argued that roasted meats were more nourishing for the body than baked meats as they were warmer and moister.[CITATION-54] The level of moisture within a particular foodstuff was crucial for determining if it would form part of a diet that could combat melancholy, whether caused by an excess of black bile or by corrupted choler. Both humours were characterised by dryness, so maintaining moisture within the body was essential for ensuring that melancholy could not take hold. According to Elyot the most \u2018convenient\u2019 foods to eat to avoid melancholy were those that \u2018be temperate in heate, but specially they that be moyst\u2019.[CITATION-55] The crusts of bread, which were deemed \u2018verie drie\u2019, could engender melancholy, as could other overly dry foods such as coleworts and cabbages\u2014these had \u2018a drying and binding facultie\u2019 that engendered a \u2018grosse and Melancholicke blood\u2019.[CITATION-56] As well as avoiding dry foods, readers of health regimens were also advised to incorporate certain foods into their diets to prevent the onset of melancholy. Cogan recommended that those who were predisposed to melancholy, such as the elderly, who had naturally drier and colder bodies, should drink wine moderately as it \u2018maketh them merry and represseth melancholinesse\u2019.[CITATION-57] Melancholy was not the only illness of the passions that could be avoided through careful management of diet. The passion of anger, if excessive, was believed to be particularly harmful.[CITATION-58] According to the puritan theologian John Downame, anger was the result of \u2018heating of the bloud about the hart\u2019 and should be avoided at all costs.[CITATION-59] Anger could be precipitated by a number of things, including jealousy, pride and inordinate desire, and could lead to trembling limbs, reddening of the face and gnashing of teeth.[CITATION-60] Anger, if not moderated and properly controlled, was also thought to lead to a loss of reason which in turn could result in a descent into madness.[CITATION-61] Given its alarming consequences, advice about how to avoid anger was widespread in moralistic and medical texts. Downame noted in his discussion of anger that \u2018wise Physitions thinke it the better & safer course to preserve health and prevent sicknesse, then to remove the disease after it hath taken possession of the body\u2019.[CITATION-62] As with most medical advice in the early modern period, then, prevention was believed to be better than a cure.As with melancholy, there were a variety of means by which anger could be avoided but diet was once again a key consideration. Those of a choleric constitution were more prone to bouts of anger, as their bodies were already overly hot and dry.[CITATION-63] Anything that increased body heat beyond normal levels could result in the production of heat around the heart and the passion of anger. Similarly, for those unaccustomed to hot, dry foods, eating an abundance of foods that could increase levels of choler in the body could also leave them vulnerable to the disease of anger. Foods that had the potential to increase choler included onions, garlic, honey, pepper and mustard.[CITATION-64] These foods were believed to be particularly heating and drying and thus matched the elemental qualities of the hot, dry humour choler. Describing garlic, the herbalist John Gerard noted that it is \u2018very sharpe, hot, and dry\u2019, warning that those \u2018of a hot complexion must especially abstaine from it\u2019.[CITATION-65] Other foods with similar properties that physicians and herbalists recommended avoiding to keep choler, and the associated passion of anger, at bay included salt, leeks, mint, thick wine and heating spices.[CITATION-66] As with the dietary advice on melancholy, foods with the opposite humoral characteristics were recommended for those who were vulnerable to elevated levels of choler. Ingredients that were considered temperamentally moist, such asand violets, and those that had cooling properties, such as barberries and cherries, helped keep choler at safe levels and the passion of anger unstirred.[CITATION-67] Elyot recommended that those who \u2018abounded\u2019 in choler should follow a strict dietary programme of cooling and moistening the body by eating \u2018meates, whiche be cold in a moderate quantite\u2019, diluting \u2018their wyne more or lasse with water\u2019 and \u2018eschewynge hotte spices, hotte wines, and excessiue labour\u2019.[CITATION-68] The role played by diet in regulating emotional health, however, went beyond a consideration of how certain foods might elevate levels of particular humours. To keep the passions well governed, a long-term dietary strategy was required. Comfort eating was not a temporary practice, only employed at moments of emotional weakness to restore humoral balance, but rather was part and parcel of everyday approaches to food intake. In a compiled and translated text from 1634 entitled, avoiding unwanted passions, such as anger, was linked to broader lifestyle decisions in which a person\u2019s daily diet was critically important. Each of the authors included within the compendium advocated a sparse or \u2018sober\u2019 diet to their readers, arguing that sobriety in eating \u2018is the soveraigne means and instrument for preservation of bodily health and vigoar of minde in and unto long old age\u2019.[CITATION-69] Temperance in eating would inevitably lead to temperance in the body. A temperate body, free from corrupted or excessive humours, was the key, so these authors argued, to a vigorous mind and well-ordered passions. As Leonardus Lessius, the principal author of the, succinctly put it, \u2018the conditions of the Minde follow the temper of the Bodie\u2019.[CITATION-70] Lessius argued that over-eating caused \u2018superfluous excrements\u2019 and evil vapours that were transmitted from the stomach to the head. These corrupted vapours, as we have seen, could infect the entire bodily system, agitating the various spirits that coursed through the body and provoking unwanted and troublesome passions around the heart. Lessius explained to his readers that \u2018benigne juice\u2019 \u2018causeth benigne affections\u2019, while \u2018malignant juices\u2019 \u2018causeth fierceness and wildnesse in the affections\u2019.[CITATION-71] By overwhelming the stomach with too much food (Lessius advised only eating 12\u201314 ounces of food a day), regardless of the individual elemental make-up of specific foodstuffs, early modern people ran the risk of ruining the process of concoction, and this in turn could result in the creation of corrupted humours, spirits and undesirable passions.Lessius\u2019s publication did not only mete out advice. Within the text, a case-study was provided that demonstrated the value of a sober diet and the extraordinary health results it could produce. One tract included in the publication was, written by Luigi Cornaro, a Venetian landowner who was well known for his longevity.[CITATION-72] Cornaro put his exceptionally long life and good health down to his diet. He explained that when he lived \u2018intemperately\u2019, eating what and how much he desired, he endured many \u2018discommodities of the bodie, and troubles of the minde\u2019.[CITATION-73] Turning towards a sober diet and avoiding foods that he enjoyed but were \u2018hurtfull\u2019, such as cool wines, cakes and sausages, Cornaro found \u2018that neither melancholie, nor any other passion\u2019 could hurt his body.[CITATION-74] He also noted that when his friends encouraged him to abandon his temperate diet and increase the quantity of food he ate, within ten days he went from being \u2018a cheerfull and merrie man\u2019 to a \u2018melancholie and cholerick\u2019 one for whom \u2018all things were troublesome\u2019.[CITATION-75] Writing at the age of 83, Cornaro concluded that thanks to his restrictive diet, in which the body was fed foods that were good for it, rather than foods that it delighted in, he was \u2018ever cheerfull, merrie, and well-contented, free from all trouble and troublesome thoughts\u2019.[CITATION-76] The pursuit of cheerfulness was deemed critical to bodily and emotional health in the early modern period. Individuals were advised not just to avoid the negative passions of anger and melancholy, but also actively to cultivate the positive states of joy and cheerfulness. As Newton and Weisser have noted, expressions of cheerfulness and joy among those suffering with illness were often seen as good indications that the patient was recovering. Similarly, Cavallo and Storey have noted that stimulatingthat is, cheerfulness\u2014was of central importance in preventative healthcare practices in Renaissance Italy.[CITATION-77] Medical authorities agreed that appropriate levels of cheerfulness, along with other passions such as mirth and joy, were a sign of a body in good health. According to Wright, \u2018Pleasure and Delight, if it bee moderate, bringeth health, because the purer spirites retyre vnto the heart, and they helpe marvellously the digestion of blood\u2019.[CITATION-78] Once again, the passions were entangled with the movement of bodily materials, processes of digestion and the workings of the heart. Coeffeteau also argued that positive passions impacted the heart in beneficial ways. While sorrow caused the heart to shrink and \u2018freezeth with griefe\u2019, and anger left the heart \u2018inflamed and all on fire\u2019, in moments when joy and desire were stirred the heart would melt \u2018with gladnesse\u2019.[CITATION-79] Cultivating positive passions, therefore, was crucial for the proper functioning of the human body.Positively construed passions, like their negative counterparts, could also be triggered by certain foods and particular dietary practices. Some moralists and theologians, such as Cornaro and Lessius, advocated a limited diet, both in terms of quantity and the types of food eaten, to promote cheerfulness. As Lessius noted, eating too much food resulted in \u2018a certain kinde of dulnesse, heavinesse, and slothfull wearinesse\u2019. The purpose of eating, so Lessius explained, was to \u2018refresh the strength and powers of the bodie\u2019, which would in turn make a person \u2018more cheerfull\u2019.[CITATION-80] Constantly over-feeding the body corrupted digestion, which led to the creation of ill humours that stimulated negative passions. Because of the connections between the humours and passions, Lessius argued that once the humours had been contaminated by a glut of food it would be difficult to restore the body to good emotional health: \u2018evil Humours do not onely excite and stirre up passions, and set them on work; but again by a certain sympathie that is between them, are themselves also set on fire, and strengthened by the passions\u2019.[CITATION-81] This back and forth between corrupted humours and negative passions could result in the strengthening of those passions, exacerbating the symptoms of disorders such as anger and melancholy. As Lessius explained it, an abundance of \u2018cholerick humour \u2026 stirres up wrath\u2019, then the \u2018the commotion of Anger \u2026 sets on fire the spirits and the cholerick humour\u2019, which in turn inflames choler and leads to the passion of anger being \u2018increased and fortified\u2019 to such a degree that it might turn \u2018from Anger into Madnesse\u2019.[CITATION-82] Over-eating resulted in a vicious cycle of corrupted humours and negative passions working in tandem to disrupt body and mind. Having a more restricted diet had the opposite effect. A small amount of food produced good blood and good humours, which stimulated cheerfulness\u2014itself crucial for good health and bodily balance.Calls for a restrictive diet were also framed by the Christian ideals of the period, ideas that were shared by Catholics like Lessius, and English Protestants. Gluttony, as one of the seven deadly sins, was believed to be detrimental not only to the health of the soul, but also the health of the body. Philip Stubbes, an English pamphleteer who was known for his puritanical attack on what he saw as the ungodly customs of the era, decried eating to excess, arguing that gluttony invariably led to idolatry. Not only that, Stubbes also claimed that eating a variety of foods in large quantities left bodies undernourished, with the food remaining undigested in the stomach like \u2018dirte in a filthie sinck or pryuie\u2019.[CITATION-83] Christian beliefs surrounding the importance of fasting also intersected with medical ideas about the role of diet in the regulation of the passions. While gluttonous behaviour overwhelmed the stomach and the soul, fasting did the opposite. As Alec Ryrie has shown, English Protestants retained the practice of fasting in the wake of the Reformation, believing it to represent an outward sign of inner repentance. Fasting also had the power to provoke the passions. It could help stimulate appropriate levels of godly sorrow, helping an individual feel the sorrow of sin, but could also tame excessive passions that took hold in the heart.[CITATION-84] Richard Rogers, a puritan English clergyman, described in a diary entry from September 1589 how he found fasting and maintaining a \u2018moderate diet\u2019 helpful for making his heart content and for \u2018subduinge all inordinate affect[tions]\u2019 in every way he wished.[CITATION-85] Fasting helped remind individuals of the sorrow of sin while also ensuring that their bodies were not overtaken with lustful and ungodly passions. The power of restrictive diets was thus viewed and theorised though both a medical and a religious lens.Avoiding negative passions was therefore not as simple as abstaining from foods that elevated certain humours. The approach advocated by the likes of Lessius and Cornaro stressed that a strict diet needed to be regularly maintained. If an individual wished to remain merry and cheerful, and live to an old age, there were no temporary dietary fixes. Food needed to be carefully rationed and individuals needed to ascertain what foods were good for their body, and refrain from eating foods that were enjoyable but nonetheless harmful. Although Lessius\u2019s tract was popular in England, remaining in print well into the eighteenth century, it is unclear the extent to which English men and women actually incorporated his advice into their daily lives and diets.[CITATION-86] Puritans like Rogers clearly aligned fasting with godliness and healthy passions, as did Ralph Josselin, the vicar of Earls Colne in Essex, who gave his own thoughts on Lessius\u2019s strict dietary advice in a diary entry from January 1649. Although Josselin was not convinced that diligently measuring the amount of food eaten on a daily basis was necessary, he nonetheless concurred with Lessius and Cornaro that a \u2018full diet is not best\u2019 as \u2018plus necat gula quam gladius\u2019 (\u2018gluttony kills more than the sword\u2019). Moreover, Josselin considered a \u2018slender and a hard diett\u2019 to be particularly conducive to his own health and he resolved to be \u2018more moderate\u2019 in his diet in the future.[CITATION-87] Josselin does not give us an indication of whether he managed to incorporate Lessius\u2019s advice successfully into his own diet, but his diary, along with other letters and journals from the seventeenth century, suggests that restricting food intake was not the only way to spark cheerfulness through dietary choices. Cornaro noted that the general belief was that \u2018that which savours, is good and nourisheth\u2019.[CITATION-88] In other words, to stay healthy in body and mind, a person should eat foods that they enjoyed as they were likely to provide more nourishment. Lessius himself confessed that his ideas were not shared by all. As he begrudgingly admitted, it was generally accepted that it was \u2018a great part of unhappinesse to be limited in a mans diet\u2019.[CITATION-89] Not only did many people consider a full and tasty diet to be good for health, they also believed that restricting your diet and not eating the foods you enjoyed could actually lead to the production of negative passions such as unhappiness. The senses, including that of taste, were indelibly linked to the creation of the passions. Wright noted that the senses were \u2018joint friends\u2019 with the passions and \u2018whatsoever delighted sense, pleased the passions\u2019.[CITATION-90] An object, such as a particular food, would transfer its qualities to the senses (in this case, the taste buds) which would then transport this data via the spirits to the brain. This sensory information was then calibrated by the imagination, which would create an impression of the external object, in this case a specific food, to which the sensitive soul would respond with the creation of passions.[CITATION-91] If, for example, a particular food tasted pleasurable, this sensory experience would stimulate positive passions, while if a food elicited disgust from the taste buds, a negative impression and negative passions would be created. How a food tasted thus helped individuals assess the potential impact it might have on the passions.While some, such as Josselin, could see the benefits of a spare diet, others sought comfort and pleasure through food, eating and recommending that others eat foods that brought them joy and cheerfulness.[CITATION-92] In particular, the gifting of food and acts of commensality were considered excellent ways of promoting the health of the passions. Eating together and exchanging gifts of food not only established and strengthened social bonds and promoted ideals of Christian community and altruism, but were also practices that had significant medical implications.[CITATION-93] In letters and diaries from the seventeenth century, gifts of particular foods with specific health properties were received and understood through the language of the passions. Common gifts included sugar, capons (castrated cockerels) and other delicate meats, and wine.[CITATION-94] Sugar was considered a perfect \u2018corrective\u2019 ingredient and was used regularly in early modern medicaments for a range of ailments.[CITATION-95] Sweetness as a sensation was also highly valued as it provoked comforting passions, such as joy and mirth.[CITATION-96] Josselin recorded several occasions when he received or gave this health-giving ingredient as a gift.[CITATION-97] Around Christmas 1644, Josselin received from a \u2018loving friend\u2019 four sugar loaves and on another occasion, and from a different friend, Mr Hickford, he was pleased to be gifted \u2018a sugar loafe\u2019, which he described as a \u2018liberall and bounteous guift\u2019, the giving of which was an act of \u2018love and goodnes\u2019. He too gifted sugar to his friends and patrons, noting in January 1650 that he sent his Lady a \u2018sugar loafe which cost 7s. 4d.\u2019.[CITATION-98] These high-cost and medically important gifts were thus interpreted as gestures of love and friendship that reminded recipients of the good cheer that positive relationships could bring. Comfort eating was therefore not only a dimension of individual healthcare practices, but also central to the well-being of the community. Early modern protagonists were highly attuned to the embodied experiences of others, using food gifts to help nurture and manage the passions of their friends, neighbours and loved ones.Some letter writers even used the memory of eating particular foods to help forge more positive passions in their correspondents. Lady Joan Barrington, a prominent Essex woman known for her godliness and patronage, had suffered from melancholy since the death of her husband, Sir Francis Barrington, in July 1628. While the puritan minister Ezekiel Rogers wrote to Barrington expressing his hope that her \u2018olde disease of melancholy\u2019 had been \u2018banished away by faith\u2019, her son Thomas and her steward Tobias continued to express concern over her persistent \u2018sadness\u2019.[CITATION-99] Tobias, in a bid to cheer up Barrington, sent her some capons in December 1629 in the hope that they would help her \u2018health and stomach\u2019 and be eaten \u2018with as much joy and mirth as ever capons weare\u2019.[CITATION-100] In reminding Barrington of the joy that could be sparked through eating, Tobias no doubt hoped his mistress\u2019s long battle with melancholy would end. Like sugar, capons were also considered to be particularly healthy. As Cogan noted, capons were the most \u2018agreeable\u2019 type of flesh, \u2018as well in sicknesse as in health\u2019, as they were light of digestion.[CITATION-101] Barrington seemingly recognised this, as she too was accustomed to gift capons to her loved ones. Johanna St John, Barrington\u2019s granddaughter, was delighted to receive several such birds from her grandmother, declaring that there is \u2018no greater dantis [dainty] then a country capon\u2019.[CITATION-102] Eating together could also have similarly desirable outcomes for the passions. Medical authorities recommended that a state of cheerfulness could be achieved through pleasant diversions, mild intellectual stimulation and the invigoration of the senses.[CITATION-103] In the, the English translation of the Dutch physician Levinus Lemnius\u2019s, moderate banqueting is endorsed as one such cheerful activity. For melancholic people, who were known to be especially sullen, it was advised they \u2018use banquetting and good cheere amonge honest and mery company\u2019 to improve the health of their passions.[CITATION-104] This advice seems to have been enthusiastically followed by those who could afford such diversions. George Davenport, an Anglican clergyman living in the north of England, recorded in his many letters to his former tutor at Cambridge, William Sancroft, the pleasure he derived from eating with company.[CITATION-105] Having eaten with his friends a pottage made from pork, cabbage and leeks in Paris, he described himself and his companions as \u2018very merry\u2019. Similarly, he noted that one year he kept a \u2018jolly Christmas\u2019, having dined some days with up to 200 people.[CITATION-106] Ralph Josselin also interpreted communal eating as a means to inculcate good cheer and feelings of affection. On the baptism of his child, for example, he arranged a banquet for his neighbours at great personal expense, during which they showed him \u2018much love\u2019. He also spent many evenings eating with his friends. In one entry, he explained how he was \u2018lovingly invited\u2019 to his \u2018neighbour Matthewes to dinner and at supper to Mrs Churches\u2019 where he experienced \u2018loving and plentifull entertainment\u2019.[CITATION-107] Similar understandings of the emotional power of commensality can be found lower down the social scale. Roger Lowe, a shopkeeper and diarist from Leigh in Lancashire, documented how he understood the sharing of food to be connected to the production of passions. In May 1667 he wrote in his diary that he intended to call on a friend of his, Mr Potter, \u2018meerely out of love\u2019, to invite him to share two pennies worth of beer with him. When Mr Potter declined, Lowe noted that he \u2018seemed as if he ware angry\u2019 which caused Lowe to return home feeling \u2018very pensive and sad and not very well\u2019.[CITATION-108] For Lowe, the sharing of food, in this case beer, and Mr Potter\u2019s refusal, sparked a number of feelings, from love and sadness on his part, to the apparent anger of his friend. Being unwilling to participate in the widespread practice of sharing food could indicate that the passions were in disarray. These negative passions, as we see in the case of Lowe, could also be transferred to those whose invitation to partake in commensality had been snubbed.Food was also gifted or shared at emotionally sensitive times, again suggesting that there was a link between specific foodstuffs and the regulation of the passions, and that this connection shaped people\u2019s everyday social engagement with food. For example, Isaac Archer described in his diary the death of his mother and two siblings when he was eight years old. He explained that his schoolmistress, who had been with his mother when she had died, had brought him cake and that because he was \u2018but a child\u2019 he was \u2018more pleased with the cakes \u2026 then grieved for so unspeakable a loss\u2019.[CITATION-109] The fact that his schoolmistress provided the young Isaac with cake at this moment of extreme emotional trauma again points to the role of food, particularly pleasurable foods, in attempts to stave off negative passions. Similar examples can be found in the correspondence of Lord Fitzwilliam and in Josselin\u2019s diary. Fitzwilliam noted in his letters that his wife had been gifted chine and black pudding by a Mrs Bull on several occasions. One such gift came soon after the death of their son William, which had left Lady Fitzwilliam \u2018so afflicted\u2019, presumably with grief, that her husband worried it would \u2018put her into a fitt of sickness\u2019.[CITATION-110] Ken Albala has suggested that the gifting of black pudding had strong affective resonances, as this was a foodstuff that was believed to be especially beneficial for replenishing blood and thus keeping the body in good working order. By sending Lady Fitzwilliam black pudding, Mrs Bull sent not only a \u2018symbol of heart-felt affection\u2019 but also a healthy food that would help Lady Fitzwilliam recover from her grief.[CITATION-111] Josselin also wrote in his diary about receiving gifts of food in the aftermath of a child\u2019s death. His son Ralph had died when he was just a baby and he had been buried with \u2018the teares and sorrow not onely of the parents and Mrs Mary Church, but with the teares and sorrowe of many of my [Josselin\u2019s] neighbours\u2019.[CITATION-112] In the days that followed baby Ralph\u2019s funeral, Josselin described suffering terribly. He also remarked, however, that his and his family\u2019s suffering had been eased by the kindness of Mary Church. In an entry from just two weeks after Ralph\u2019s burial, Josselin wrote that he and his wife were now feeling \u2018indifferently well and cheerly\u2019. He also noted that Mary Church had procured for his dinner some calf\u2019s head, which he \u2018much desired\u2019 and that she had been \u2018as kind to, and tender of\u2019 he and his wife \u2018as if shee were our sister\u2019.[CITATION-113] Indeed, the connections between grief, food consumption and the promotion of cheerfulness may help explain why providing food was such a prominent feature of early modern funerary customs. Mourners would come together to partake in a funerary meal that aimed to provide comfort to the bereaved and signal a return to normal life. As in moments of grief, the types of foods shared at a funerary meal mapped onto ideas about what constituted comforting foods. Sweet foods, such as cakes and biscuits, that provoked pleasure, alcoholic beverages that could cheer the spirits and nourishing meats that could promote the production of good blood all regularly featured in funerary meals.[CITATION-114] The gifting and sharing of healthy or desirable foods were thus central to affective bonds and emotional health in the early modern period. Exchanging food allowed individuals to express concern for the emotional well-being of their loved ones while also providing a practical solution that they hoped would help alleviate those suffering from grief, melancholy and sorrow. Foods that were deemed comforting were those that delighted the senses, providing nourishment to bodies awash with unbalanced humours, and those that were enticing to particular palates, whether that be young Isaac\u2019s sweet cakes, Barrington\u2019s health-giving capons or Josselin\u2019s much-desired calf\u2019s head.Comfort eating was at the centre of preventative healthcare aimed at managing the passions. Eating the correct types of food and in the right quantity could stave off unwanted negative passions, keeping the body balanced and its constituent material components in equilibrium. As well as protecting the body from negative passions, food also had the power to cultivate the more positive passion of cheerfulness, which was itself integral to good health. These medical ideas about food, and its relationship to good emotional health, shaped people\u2019s social engagements with food, encouraging individuals to gift health-giving foodstuffs to their loved ones, and share food to stimulate joy and mirth and ease suffering during moments of emotional turmoil. Comfort eating was thus part of long-term approaches to preventative emotional healthcare, giving individuals a degree of control over their bodies and a means by which they could safeguard the health of their passions.For those who failed to control their emotional health by establishing daily practices of comfort eating, and ultimately succumbed to disorders of the passions, there were alternative methods of restoring their passions to good health. Because of the connections between the humours, the passions and the six non-natural things in early modern medical thought, maintaining good emotional health and curing disorders of the passions if they took hold required extensive knowledge of the natural world and its produce, and a thorough understanding of how certain ingredients interacted with bodily matter. Recipe books from the period attest to this knowledge, demonstrating that emotional health was often managed at the household level, incorporating information gleaned from published medical tracts and herbals, and from everyday experience of collecting plants and creating medicaments.[CITATION-115] Producing recipes with ingredients that had the power to comfort the passions was thus part of broader early modern medical knowledge and another important dimension of comfort-eating practices.Of all the emotional disorders that feature in early modern recipe books, melancholy, and its various cures, is undoubtedly the most common. Cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger were familiar ingredients in medicaments for melancholy.[CITATION-116] These spices were prized for their acute heating properties, which would help banish the cold humour of melancholy and restore vital heat to the body. One such recipe called for several heating spices to be combined. Appearing in the recipe book of Sir Thomas Osborne, the first duke of Leeds, this remedy for melancholy included an ounce of cinnamon, two nutmegs and a \u2018penyworth\u2019 of saffron.[CITATION-117] Each of these ingredients was known to be useful in the treatment of cold diseases and, thanks to the heat that they produced, could help \u2018make \u2026 a man merry\u2019.[CITATION-118] In other recipes, this same process of heating could be achieved by sourcing ingredients from closer to home. These ingredients may have been particularly beneficial for those who could not afford the expense of buying a variety of spices from the apothecary, or for those who lived in more rural areas where regularly sourcing foreign ingredients would have been more difficult.[CITATION-119] While more elite households may have grown their own herbs in kitchen gardens, those from more modest families may have purchased herbs with specific medical properties from herb women.[CITATION-120] Borage, balm and bugloss all feature prominently in recipes to tackle melancholy and were ingredients that could be bought from travelling herb women or grown at home.[CITATION-121] Like spices from the East, these plants were characterised by herbalists as having heating properties that were particularly beneficial for the treatment of melancholy.[CITATION-122] Most of these herbs and spices were classified as being hot in the second or third degree, meaning they could heat the body sufficiently but not excessively.[CITATION-123] In contrast, plants that were characterised as the very hottest, in the fourth degree, had to be approached with caution. Gerard, in his description of garlic, which he classified as hot in the fourth degree, recommended boiling it first to eradicate its \u2018evill juyce\u2019. Gerard also advised that when using herbs and spices in the third or fourth degree, it was prudent to combine them with other ingredients to temper their heat. In an entry for rocket, for example, he cautioned that due to its heat it is \u2018not fit nor accustomed to be eaten alone\u2019.[CITATION-124] For those compiling recipes for disorders such as melancholy, therefore, extensive knowledge of both domestic and foreign plants was required, as was access to these ingredients.Heat was not, however, the only quality that needed to be achieved in a successful remedy for melancholy. As we have already seen, the disease was characterised by dryness, so restoring moisture to the body was key. Generating moisture within these recipes would also be required to counteract the heating qualities of the herbs and spices described above. As noted earlier, both heat and moisture were vital to life, so ensuring that moisture was not lost through extreme heating was crucial. One of the ways that moisture could be obtained in these remedies was with the inclusion of wine or other beverages. The two most popular drinks in these recipes were sack and white wine, but medicines for melancholy also contained posset, ale and other nourishing liquids.[CITATION-125] It is perhaps unsurprising that various forms of wine appear most frequently in these recipes, given wine\u2019s association with health in the early modern period. Wine was believed to be analogous to human blood and was thought therefore to convert easily to blood and be assimilated into the human body. Due to its nourishing quality, wine was also thought to be hot and moist in nature and thus crucial for restoring vital heat and moisture to the body.[CITATION-126] Different wines, however, imparted slightly different properties. This was useful in terms of healthcare because, as the physician Tobias Whitaker suggested, \u2018every temper may be preserved void of all distempers, or such as arise out of the materiall principles of nature by the true use of wine\u2019.[CITATION-127] White wines were generally cooler than red wines and sweet wines were considered the most nourishing.[CITATION-128] It is perhaps this combination of mild heating and optimal nourishment that made white wines and sack, which was a fortified white wine, especially prevalent in recipes for melancholy. The wine would help restore moisture to the body while not overwhelming it with heat. These cooler, moist liquids helped balance out the intense heating and drying qualities of spices and herbs, ensuring that the dry humours associated with melancholy would be banished successfully while also maintaining levels of vital moisture within the body.The association between drinking wine and experiencing merriment also made this beverage suitable for treating melancholy. While its elemental qualities, alongside those of the herbs and spices included in the recipes, would rectify the humoral imbalances associated with the disease, the ability of wine to lift the spirits and bring \u2018gladnesse and cheerfulnesse\u2019 would also help combat the symptoms of melancholy.[CITATION-129] Writing to her sister in 1686, Anne Dormer, who suffered chronic melancholy, detailed her attempts at restoring good cheer through the consumption of various types of wine. She noted that her sister had kindly gifted her \u2018a vessel of rare wine\u2019 which gave her great joy, promising that she would take two or three spoonfuls of wine when her spirits were low.[CITATION-130] Dormer\u2019s letters, however, also suggest that the properties of certain ingredients on their own were not enough to make a foodstuff or recipe comforting\u2014personal taste and preference was also key. In another letter, she told her sister that although sack had done her emotional health a great deal of good, she had grown \u2018so weary of it\u2019 that she could \u2018take that no longer\u2019, switching instead to \u2018sherry with nutmett and sugar\u2019 in a bid to maintain the health of her passions.[CITATION-131] These recipes for melancholy, and the ingredients that they contained, also mapped on to the remedies for melancholy provided by the physician Richard Napier to his patients, suggesting that ideas about how to cure melancholy were largely consistent and widespread in the seventeenth century. On several occasions, Napier recommended \u2018Jeralog\u2019 as a medicament to help banish stubborn forms of melancholy.[CITATION-132] In one case, Napier recommended Jeralog as a treatment for a young man named Robert Alcock who had been suffering from grief and fear after having had an illicit sexual relationship with \u2018a lewd woman\u2019.[CITATION-133] Jeralog was another name for the medical compound, which had been in use since ancient times. The mixture comprised a variety of plants and spices, including mace, aloes, pepper, saffron and hellebore, which were then combined with honey to make an electuary. As Nicholas Culpeper explained in, the medicine could take away all the \u2018daily evils comming of mellancholly\u2019.[CITATION-134] As with the recipes already analysed, the ingredients contained in Jeralog provided vital heat, and the honey in which the herbs and spices were mixed, sweet nourishment. Medical knowledge of plants and their application for disorders of the passions was therefore relatively widespread. From professional physicians, such as Napier and Culpeper, to the compilers of manuscript recipe books who took personal responsibility for the health of their families, knowledge of the natural world was harnessed as a means by which to govern the passions and the various illnesses that arose from them.[CITATION-135] While the ingredients used in these recipes were largely consistent in terms of the reactions that they instigated in the body, they were also tailored to individual preferences and financial circumstances, again suggesting that notions of comforting foods could be flexible and idiosyncratic. Dormer preferred to use sherry to spark joy as she had grown weary of sack, and those of perhaps more modest financial means may have chosen to achieve the heat and moisture needed to eradicate melancholy with ingredients that could be sourced close to home and at an affordable price.The prevalence of recipes aimed at \u2018comforting\u2019 the heart indicates that domestic household medicine focused on the health of the passions was also highly preventative in ambition. As we have already seen, keeping the heart in good working order and well comforted would result in the production of benign passions and benign humours. A comforted heart was thus an excellent defence against more dangerous diseases of the passions. According to Andrew Boorde, \u2018all sweate or dulcet things doeth comforte the heart, and so doth maces and ginger, rere eggs, and poched eggs not hard\u2019.[CITATION-136] As we have seen, the enjoyable taste of sweet or \u2018dulcet things\u2019 would stir positive passions and keep the heart cheerful and in good working order. Robert Burton described the heart as the \u2018Sonne of our body\u2019 and the \u2018fountaine of life, of heat, of spirit\u2019. It was in this organ that blood was heated to its optimal temperature, meaning that keeping the heart temperately heated was crucial to keeping it healthy.[CITATION-137] The heating properties of mace and ginger, ingredients that Boorde recommended to keep the heart comforted, would help achieve such results.This focus on sweetness and on spices that would provide vital heat to the heart can also be identified in recipes aimed at comforting the heart or controlling the passions of the heart. Heating spices, such as aniseed, mace, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg, and warming herbs, such as borage, rosemary, sage and balm, all feature prominently in recipes for comforting the heart.[CITATION-138] In some recipes, however, cooling herbs and plants were recommended in recognition that the heart could also be damaged by excessive heat, not just cold. Ingredients that could provide comfort to the heart were not universal, but specific to certain conditions that were caused by different material reactions and humoral imbalances within the body. In one recipe aimed at comforting the heart, which appears in a book of seventeenth-century recipes that was compiled from a variety of sources, different recommendations are given for disorders that stem from the heart being too cold or too hot. If the \u2018faintnes of the harte\u2019 proceeded from heat, it was recommended that cooling pomegranate and barberries be combined with barley into a broth, while for disorders of the heart that stemmed from excess cold, a mixture of cloves, cinnamon and saffron steeped in white wine was advised.[CITATION-139] For illnesses of the heart that arose from coldness, sugar or other sweetening ingredients, such as honey, were also integral. How much sugar to include varied between recipes, with some indicating that only a little sugar was required, while others called for much larger quantities. As with the inclusion of heating spices and herbs, it is possible that the quantity of sugar included within a recipe reflected the financial means of the compiler, as well as personal preferences. For example, one recipe called for \u20183 pounds of sugar\u2019, while another for just \u20182 ounces\u2019.[CITATION-140] As well as providing a sweet taste to delight the heart and the passions, the inclusion of sugar in these recipes also had a more pragmatic function. In one recipe aimed at keeping the heart in good working order, the writer noted that \u2018a good quantity of Sugar\u2019 should be included to make the medicine \u2018pleasant\u2019.[CITATION-141] As Hannah Newton has demonstrated, medicines aimed at children in particular were made more palatable through the inclusion of sweeteners.[CITATION-142] Not only, then, would the inclusion of sugar mask the bitter and pungent tastes of some herbs and spices, it would also have a direct impact on the functioning of the heart, signalling to the brain and the heart, through a more pleasurable sensory experience, to produce purer spirits and more positive passions.Disorders of the passions, then, were often treated within the home. From the stubborn and ubiquitous disease of melancholy to hearts that required comforting, creating recipes for illnesses of the passions required extensive knowledge of herbs and spices, an understanding of how to combine ingredients to stimulate certain material reactions in the body, and an awareness of how the six non-natural things, the humours, and the passions were intricately connected. The diverse ingredients found within recipes aimed at restoring the passions to good health have some common traits, aligning with the elemental characteristics of disturbed humours in the case of melancholy, and stimulating a pleasurable sense of taste through the inclusion of sweeteners and fortified wines. Despite this, these recipes also illustrate the extent to which restoring comfort to the passions was contingent on individual preferences, access to particular ingredients, and a recipe-compiler having a thorough understanding of the different bodily causes of a variety of illnesses.Comfort eating was a flexible and adaptable practice that affected early modern people\u2019s daily food habits. It involved promoting the stability of the humours and the passions and keeping bodily matter in motion through the consumption of foods with particular elemental properties, but also included much broader dietary choices, from following a restrictive and sparse diet, to seeking out foods that sparked pleasure and delight and the production of beneficial passions. The belief that diet could provide comfort to the passions inflected people\u2019s daily social engagement with food. It shaped the food gifts that people gave to their loved ones, neighbours and patrons, and it influenced the way people interpreted the ubiquitous practices of hospitality and commensality. Viewed through a medical lens, the gift of foods such as sugar and capons, and the practice of sharing food in a jovial and cheerful environment, can be seen as yet another dimension of the preventative approach to healthcare that was so prominent in the early modern period. How a particular food impacted the passions went far beyond humoral considerations. While the impact of a food on levels of bodily humours was important to early modern notions of comforting foods, so too was personal preference, the context of when, where and with whom different foods were eaten, and the specificities of different disorders of the passions that often required radically different treatments. This analysis has important ramifications for the histories of medicine, food and embodiment, demonstrating that comfort eating was a widespread and varied healthcare practice that permeated early modern community food practices and key modes of social engagement.Keeping the passions in check through comfort eating required individuals to understand how their own bodies worked, to know how different foodstuffs, in different combinations, could impact the production of certain passions, and to consider the connections between diet and other social stresses that could also elevate the passions to dangerous levels. As this article has demonstrated, these were concerns that were largely confined to social groups who had the means to manage what they ate on a daily basis. Those with financial resources could choose foods that were known to lift the spirits, such as expensive wines and sweet treats, and those who were literate and could afford writing materials could note down useful recipes for combatting diseases of the passions. Although many of the sources used in this article were produced by individuals from middling and elite backgrounds, there is evidence to suggest that similar concerns were shared by those further down the social ladder. The shopkeeper Roger Lowe, although he may have not been able to afford the luxury products often associated with comfort eating and the good health of the passions, nonetheless recognised the emotional power of food and its ability to either cheer or disrupt the passions. Practices of comfort eating, then, represented a critical tool with which early modern people could manage their emotional health and the health of their wider communities, empowering them to adapt their diets where necessary, create medicines that could cure diseases of the passions, and consider how everyday social codes of hospitality and commensality could have medical implications for the health of their passions."

    "title": "King Harold\u2019s Sister Gunhild (d. 1087), a Royal Exile in Flanders*",
    "author": "Elisabeth van Houts",
    "date": "14 June 2023",
    "text": "This article is a study of the life of Gunhild (d. 1087), sister of King Harold, who, together with her mother Gytha, sought exile in Flanders after the Norman Conquest; it is set in the wider context of the fate of high-status elite or royal women in post-Conquest England. Gunhild\u2019s lead burial plaque with inscription (found in her tomb in the church of St Donatian in Bruges) constitutes a unique testimony to the fate of a royal sister in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest. Her Latin obituary, the longest known on a lead plaque for an eleventh-century woman, consists of a biographical sketch of her and her family, including her brother\u2019s death, and her itinerary in exile, while the second half is a near-hagiographical account of her as a woman religious; a new edition and English translation are included in an appendix. The article analyses the historical, literary and material aspects of Gunhild\u2019s life, including evidence from the archive of St Donatian as to the considerable wealth she bequeathed to the canons in return for her burial in the church\u2019s wall. It is suggested that as a woman religious she lived a penitential life on foreign soil not least to pay for the sins of the English defeated by the Normans. Comparison with other English royal or high-status elite women (and men) suggests that, defiantly and uniquely, Gunhild and her mother Gytha rejected accommodation with the Conqueror and instead followed the path of exile abroad, more commonly chosen by men.After the Norman Conquest of England, as the country gradually fell under the control of the newly crowned king, William the Conqueror, the English landed elite was in turmoil. Many of its men had died on the battlefield at Hastings and survivors were faced with dispossession. The Norman king handed out vast estates to his continental followers with the result that the indigenous elite lost their lands.[CITATION-1] Much has been written about Englishmen\u2019s loss of land and the allocation of vast tracts of land to William\u2019s continental followers.[CITATION-2] Much less, however, has been written about the fate of English women, including royal women, though this is a state of research that is fortunately changing.[CITATION-3] The present contribution focuses on the fate of one royal woman, Gunhild (d. 1087), sister of King Harold Godwineson (d. 1066).[CITATION-4] Despite this focus, it will become clear that the loss of the last English king\u2019s life during the battle of Hastings had momentous consequences for other members of his family, who, as we shall see, scattered far and wide to England, Ireland, Scandinavia and Flanders. These men and women all reacted to the Norman Conquest differently and followed a wide variety of survival strategies in response to this political disaster. Most of their movements can be followed patchily in documentary or narrative sources, while Gunhild\u2019s career, unusually, can be reconstructed on the basis of her Latin obituary, the longest inscribed on lead for a lay woman in the eleventh century. It has survived on a lead plaque that was buried with her in her tomb in the walls of the comital chapel of the canons of St Donatian at Bruges.[CITATION-5] Gunhild\u2019s exile in Flanders raises questions about the opportunities available for English royal women after the Norman Conquest, either at home or abroad. Much depended on whether an elite English woman was married, widowed or single, and on how wealthy she was, in particular in terms of movable wealth; her life-cycle stage and the position of any protector were crucial in determining where she might end up. For Gunhild, an important question would be where she might find shelter, physical and moral, when, deprived of close kin, she ended up abroad. Was her life in exile as a woman religious a foregone conclusion? Who protected her, in what circumstances, and at what political and emotional cost? And who remembered her and in what way? These are the questions that this article addresses, seeking answers by putting Gunhild\u2019s lead burial plaque and Latin obituary in its material and literary context, by analysing Gunhild\u2019s life on the Continent as a case-study of an elite female survivor of the Norman Conquest, and by investigating her memorial tradition.On 31 March 1786 a lead burial plaque was discovered in the church of St Donatian at Bruges with a long Latin obituary notice of Gunhild, sister of King Harold, who had died on 24 August 1087.[CITATION-6] Among the remains of a wooden coffin, still containing some bones, the lead plaque was found near where the head would have lain. The coffin itself was inside a cavity in the church\u2019s wall on the north side at a height of about one metre from the floor. The coffin was opened in the presence of the bishop of Bruges and later sealed and reburied. The church was destroyed in 1799 and in 1804, during the upheavals of the Napoleonic occupation of the Low Countries, its ruins were sold. Only the lead plaque survived; it is now kept in the treasury of St Salvator\u2019s cathedral in Bruges.[CITATION-7] The lead has badly corroded and the lettering faded but, because several transcriptions were made soon after its discovery, the text has survived more or less intact.[CITATION-8] Despite the fact that the plaque is reasonably well known, and is regularly referred to in scholarship on the Godwine family, its text has not been studied in its own right nor has it received the attention it deserves for its significance for the history of the Norman Conquest of England.Sympathy for the Anglo-Saxon \u2018doomed elite\u2019 can be detected in the glowing terms in which Gunhild\u2019s parents are described on Gunhild\u2019s plaque.[CITATION-9] What strikes the reader most is the precise information about her English noble origins, the powerful position and wealth of her parents and the pinnacle of power reached by her brother Harold:Gunhild, born of most noble parents, was English. Her father was Earl Godwine, who held a very large part of England under his military command, and her mother Gytha was born of famous Danish ancestry. As a young girl she took a vow of virginal chastity and wishing for a spiritual union she rejected marriage to several noble princes. She had already reached marriageable age when England was conquered by William, count of the Normans, who killed her brother Harold, king of the English.Godwine\u2019s status as an earl (which he held for more than three decades) and his military command (over Wessex,.1018\u201353) is here recorded, as well as his wife Gytha\u2019s noble origins in Denmark. She was the sister of Ulf Thorgilsson, who was married to Estrith, sister of King Cnut (1016\u201335). The marriage between Godwine and Gytha took place probably.1022/3, five years after Godwine had been made earl.[CITATION-10] More politically explosive is the statement, without a reference to battle, that William, pointedly referred to as count of the Normans, who had conquered England, had killed her brother King Harold.[CITATION-11] Assuming that her obituary was written shortly after her death in late August 1087, William was then still king (he died on 9 September) and Harold had been dead for more than two decades. The accusation that William had slain her brother, a legitimately chosen and crowned king, is an acknowledgement of the deep unease felt by Gunhild, many English, and indeed others in Europe about William\u2019s invasion of England and his taking of its crown.[CITATION-12] According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, version D, in 1067 (for 1068), after the siege of Exeter, Harold\u2019s mother Gytha in the company of \u2018the wives of many good men\u2019 (\u2018manegra godra manna wif\u2019) fled from the island of Flatholme in the Bristol Channel to Saint-Omer in Flanders.[CITATION-13] That our Gunhild was almost certainly among them we only know from her burial plaque, which records\u2014after the section quoted above\u2014that \u2018she fled her homeland and lived for some years in exile at Saint-Omer in Flanders\u2019. This was not the first time the Godwine family had sought refuge there since the 1040s.[CITATION-14] In 1065, having been exiled by Edward the Confessor, Gunhild\u2019s brother Earl Tostig of Northumbria and his Flemish wife Judith (widowed in 1066) had taken refuge in Flanders, where the couple were given a house and estate as well as the income of the town of Saint-Omer.[CITATION-15] It is therefore reasonable to assume that when in 1068 Gytha and Gunhild decided to leave England, Judith, as daughter-in-law and sister-in-law respectively, may have facilitated their stay at Saint-Omer.[CITATION-16] The town was an important commercial centre with easy access to the North Sea.[CITATION-17] Its main church in the centre was that of Our Lady, an establishment of secular canons, while two miles further out was the well-known Benedictine abbey of Saint-Bertin.[CITATION-18] Women were forbidden entry to the Saint-Bertin complex and there is no evidence for communities of women religious attached to either house. Presumably Gytha, Gunhild and their servants lived either on the hospitality extended to them by Judith or whoever was their Flemish host, or independently on the considerable moveable wealth that they had been able to bring with them\u2014an issue I will return to shortly. Gunhild\u2019s age at that time is unknown, though her obituary tells us that \u2018she had already reached marriageable age when England was conquered\u2019. As she must have been born before her father Godwine\u2019s death in 1053, this suggests that she was at least 13 in 1066 or 15 at the time of exile, but she could have been in her late teens or early twenties.[CITATION-19] At some stage, so the plaque records, Gunhild left Saint-Omer: \u2018She went to Bruges where she lived for a few years and from there crossed to Denmark\u2019. The move north from southern Flanders was probably prompted by the loss of the women close to her. Her mother died almost certainly at Saint-Omer, though in an unknown year.[CITATION-20] In.1070 her sister-in-law Judith left Flanders for Bavaria, where she married Welf IV as her second husband.[CITATION-21] Around the same time Flanders experienced a civil war.Count Baldwin V (1035\u201367) had followed a policy of near \u00adneutrality when his son-in-law William (married to his daughter Matilda) prepared the invasion of England.[CITATION-22] He did not prevent his nobles from taking part, but neither did he encourage them to do so. The twelfth-century rumour, recorded by William of Malmesbury, that he provided his son-in-law with soldiers in return for a cash sum, may arise from backdating the series of twelfth-century Anglo-Flemish treaties to the Conquest.[CITATION-23] As guardian of the under-age king of France, Philip I (1060\u20131108), Count Baldwin V\u2019s primary responsibility was his own principality and the realm of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.[CITATION-24] On 1 September 1067 Baldwin V died and within three years his eldest son Baldwin VI too died, on 17 July 1070. Baldwin VI\u2019s eldest son Arnulf III succeeded but his rule was challenged by his paternal uncle, Robert the Frisian. Despite the support of Philip I of France, most of the southern Flemish nobles and an army sent by King William, at the battle of Cassel in February 1071 Arnulf III was killed and Robert the Frisian emerged as victor.[CITATION-25] Thereafter Count Robert never forgave his royal brother-in-law William for having supported Arnulf. Relations between the Anglo-Norman and Flemish rulers deteriorated further for three reasons. First, many southern Flemish nobles who had supported the losing side left for England to supplement the Flemish settlers who had helped win the Norman Conquest.[CITATION-26] Secondly, in 1078\u20139 Robert the Frisian gave shelter to Robert Curthose (d. 1134), eldest son of King William and Matilda, who was at war with his father over his refusal to give him Normandy.[CITATION-27] And thirdly, potentially even more threateningly for King William, the Flemish count allied himself with Denmark. In the late 1070s or early 1080s his daughter Adela had married Cnut IV. Two years after the death of his sister Queen Matilda in 1083, Robert the Frisian prepared a fleet to join Cnut\u2019s invasion of England to oust William as king, a plan scuppered by Cnut\u2019s murder in the cathedral of Odense.[CITATION-28] These events in Flanders provide a context for Gunhild\u2019s movements, from Saint-Omer to Bruges\u2014perhaps seeking firmer protection from Robert the Frisian in his stronghold\u2014and then, after some time, to Denmark, prompted, we may guess, by a wish to seek out her late mother\u2019s Danish relatives.Gunhild\u2019s departure from Bruges for Denmark can plausibly be linked with Adela\u2019s marriage to King Cnut IV, which is dated to the late 1070s or early 1080s, as it is conceivable that she joined Adela on her way to her new homeland.[CITATION-29] Alternatively, Gunhild, with some of her treasure, may have left for Denmark in the mid-1080s as part of preparations for the Flemish\u2013Danish campaign to invade England. King Cnut\u2019s murder not only prevented the planned invasion of England but also caused his widow Adela to return to Flanders.[CITATION-30] If at this time Gunhild was indeed in Denmark, she may have accompanied Adela on her return to Flanders together with Adela\u2019s son Charles but leaving his two sisters behind. Without any more clues we do not know how long Gunhild stayed in Denmark, though her obituary suggests that it was not long beforeshe returned here [Bruges]\u2019, where she spent the remaining years of her life.That Robert the Frisian provided protection to King Harold\u2019s sister Gunhild remains politically most significant as implicit support for the house of Godwine and for other Anglo-Saxon victims of the Norman occupation of England.[CITATION-31] His actions against William the Conqueror and by implication his sister Queen Matilda may well have had consequences for his mother Countess Adela (d. 1079), as we will see.[CITATION-32] Gunhild\u2019s obituary ends with her death: \u2018she died a virgin in the year 1087 on 24 August at the twenty second day of the full moon\u2019. Gunhild\u2019s obituary and the life it describes raise many issues. But \u00adbefore pursuing them, the artefact on which they are recorded and its context demand our attention, not least because Gunhild\u2019s plaque was not the only one prepared for a member of the Godwine family.Lead plaques inscribed with basic biographical information in Latin, such as a name and year of death, can be found in early medieval Europe north of the Alps and Pyrenees from the late Merovingian period onwards.[CITATION-33] They were produced as cheaper alternatives to inscribed stone, which was a legacy of the Roman period. There are some late eighth-century Carolingian stones with incised lettering where the letters were filled with lead.[CITATION-34] The Roman heritage of inscriptions in stone inspired the later northern European practice of recording the dead person\u2019s biographical details in lead.[CITATION-35] It seems to have been a Carolingian practice to bury men and women with a plaque placed on or near their body. Originally lead plaques were probably nothing more than what we might call identification tags, made of durable material that, when still soft, was easy to write on with a stylus.[CITATION-36] Before burial they were placed either near the head of the body, sometimes under the head, or, most often, on the body\u2019s breast. Most lead plaques were in the shape of rectangles or squares but a good number were in the form of a cross, bearing witness to the liturgical rite for death and burial. An important clue to the penitential aspect of the lead plaques and crosses for monks is given by the monastic rule of Lanfranc (d. 1089), William the Conqueror\u2019s first appointee to the see of Canterbury.[CITATION-37] After death the body is sewn into a cloth and his fellow monks \u2018lay the body out carefully in the grave, and put upon its breast a written absolution that has been read out by the brethren\u2019.[CITATION-38] Lanfranc, however, does not specify the material on which the \u2018written absolution\u2019 should be inscribed, but it is worth noting that\u2014whether made of parchment or of lead\u2014it is put on the shroud and not actually on the body. Penitential lead plaques and crosses were left with the bodies of the dead as evidence that the deceased had confessed their sins, or at least that God had been asked for forgiveness. Increasingly, however, the penitentiary purpose of the cross or plaque that was prevalent in England gave way to a more elaborate biographical account, especially in northern France and Flanders.[CITATION-39] A good example is the Flemish \u2018titulus\u2019 of John of Warneton, bishop of Th\u00e9rouanne (d. 1130). The author of his Life, Archdeacon Walter, explained that he had written the \u2018titulus\u2019 for Bishop John on lead and parchment (sealed in a glass container) and that both were buried with him.[CITATION-40] Although neither object has survived, the text of the obituary notice was copied into Bishop John\u2019s Life. When parchment and leadwere produced for the same person and buried with them, we may wonder whether the text on the lead plaque and on the parchment may have followed the same layout. This question is important because in Gunhild\u2019s case her obituary text was written out on lead as if on parchment.Gunhild\u2019s plaque measures 24.5 cm x 19.5\u201320.5 cm, which is about the average size for a lead plaque of a high-status person. It was prepared with lines for a text consisting of twenty-four lines written in Carolingian minuscule script with a layout that resembles that of a parchment sheet. This layout explains some last-minute adjustments about three-quarters of the way down, halfway through line eighteen, starting with the words, when the writing becomes squeezed as if the scribe realised that he might be running out of space. Among the lead plaques that have survived, this parchment layout is highly unusual. Moreover, the lettering on Gunhild\u2019s plaque is not the uncial script used for lead inscriptions, which tended mostly, but not exclusively, to imitate inscriptions in capital letters on stone.[CITATION-41] It is in Carolingian minuscule with only some capital letters, and clearly imitates a statement on parchment. Lead was chosen for preservation purposes but the layout was perhaps meant to convey extra authority or intended as a tribute to a person\u2019s high status. Conceivably, the imitation of parchment might indicate that a parchment copy had also been produced, as in the case of Bishop John of Th\u00e9rouanne discussed earlier.[CITATION-42] Crucially, lead burial plaques with penitential prayers or biographical details, or both, were buried with elite persons, prompting the question: for whose benefit? Hidden in tombs, nobody but the dead person was in contact with them. It has been suggested that the evidence would help the identification of bodies at the Last Judgement.[CITATION-43] But would God not have known who had been buried where? Alternatively, and in my view more probably, it was well enough known (often through direct experience) that graves could be disturbed either on purpose for reburial, or transfer, or accidentally as a result of building work to a church or damage. Any help with identification of bodies, whether at the Last Judgement or sooner, was clearly deemed useful for future generations.[CITATION-44] Some biographical obituaries were highly political in their statements, suggesting that the dead, or their families, friends or colleagues, wished to make sure that the circumstances of their death and any significant events in their lives were recorded for posterity. Gunhild\u2019s lead plaque falls into this category; but it was not unique in the Godwine family, as another one has survived, albeit from several (short) generations later, and not in Flanders but in Lincoln.The so-called d\u2019Aincourt lead plaque from Lincoln was made for William d\u2019Aincourt, a young boy who died in the 1090s.[CITATION-45] It was discovered in 1675 in the grounds of Lincoln Cathedral and measures 34 cm x 22 cm. It is thus another fairly large plaque with text covering only the top two-thirds of its length, suggesting that it was meant to be placed underneath the boy\u2019s head. The text is as follows:Here lies William, son of Walter d\u2019Aincourt who was a kinsman of Remigius, bishop of Lincoln, who built this church. The said William, born of royal stock, died on 30 October, while living in fosterage at the court of William, son of King William the elder who conquered England.[CITATION-46] William\u2019s identification by Richard Sharpe as a great-grandson of King Harold put an end to the commonly held interpretation that the reference to \u2018royal stock\u2019 () was to kinship with the new Norman king William the Conqueror rather than the English king Harold. The English blood-relationship can be explained in the female line via the boy William\u2019s mother Matilda, married to Walter d\u2019Aincourt (d. before 1116), who was a daughter of Count Alan Rufus (d. 1093) and Gunhild, the daughter of King Harold and thus the niece of the Gunhild buried at Bruges. A genealogical schema provides a visual image of William\u2019s ancestry:[CITATION-47] King Harold (d. 1066) = Eadgifu Swanneck (d. after 1066)|Gunhild (.1054\u2013d. after 1094) = Alan Rufus, earl of Richmond (d. 1093)|Matilda (.1073\u2013d. after.1090) = Walter d\u2019Aincourt (d. by 1116)|William d\u2019Aincourt (.1090\u2013d. by 1100)At the time the cathedral at Lincoln, although an old institution, was a relatively new complex, the episcopal seat having been transferred from Dorchester-on-Thames in 1072.[CITATION-48] There is no doubt that technical and literary expertise was available for the production of lead tablets and the composition of the texts.[CITATION-49] William\u2019s obituary is shorter and less literary than that of his great-aunt Gunhild. The obituary of the boy William is especially significant for its unique revelation that as a boy of recent, albeit short-lived, English royal stock he was brought up at the court of the Conqueror\u2019s son William Rufus (1087\u20131100).[CITATION-50] It is noteworthy that the remark on William\u2019s (English) royal stock is made not in connection with Lincoln Cathedral so much as in connection with his upbringing at the Norman royal court in England. A decade or so after the Conqueror himself had sanctioned Harold\u2019streatment in Domesday Book\u2014Harold is never referred to as king\u2014it is striking how the plaque reminds us, in an oblique way, of William\u2019s condemned great-grandfather.[CITATION-51] It illustrates how Harold\u2019s daughter Gunhild and in turn her daughter Matilda kept the memory of Harold\u2019s kingship alive, albeit on a tablet buried with William, named after the Conqueror, at Lincoln.[CITATION-52] Since he was only a relatively young child the commission for the plaque and its text presumably came from his parents, Matilda and Walter d\u2019Aincourt. In the case of Gunhild\u2019s plaque, before we can come to a conclusion about the authorship and audience of Gunhild\u2019s obituary with any confidence, we need to explore the friendship she established with the canons of St Donatian and her life as a religious woman in their vicinity.St Donatian\u2019s church in Bruges was a house of canons founded either by Count Baldwin I (.863\u201379) or by his grandson Count Arnulf I of Flanders (918\u201365).[CITATION-53] It was an imposing church, built in imitation of Charlemagne\u2019s chapel at Aachen with a massive west end and polygonal core, where forty years later in 1127 Count Charles the Good was murdered.[CITATION-54] Badly damaged on that occasion, the church was rebuilt as a Romanesque basilica and then as a Gothic church. Significantly for our purpose, St Donatian was the chapel of the counts of Flanders; it had a provost who from time to time acted as the counts\u2019 chancellor, and a chapter of canons some of whom have been identified as scribes of the Flemish counts\u2019 charters.[CITATION-55] Why did the canons of St Donatian support Gunhild by offering her a place of burial? The answer lies, partly, in her wealth. Evidence for her wealth comes from Domesday Book in England and from St Donatian itself. Domesday Book, compiled in 1086, is the only other eleventh-century evidence concerning Gunhild apart from her plaque.[CITATION-56] It reports that in 1066 Gunhild held the income of four manors, one in Sussex and three in Somerset, comprising approximately 30 hides, giving her an annual income of just under \u00a330.[CITATION-57] By 1086, and probably much sooner after the Conquest, this income had been confiscated and reallocated to Norman holders. Contemporary historians mention her mother Gytha\u2019s vast wealth. William of Poitiers, biographer of William the Conqueror, recorded that after the battle of Hastings the victor refused Gytha\u2019s offer of the weight of Harold\u2019s body in gold.[CITATION-58] Probably basing his account on the now lost section of this biography, Orderic Vitalis mentions that when Gytha went into exile she carried with her \u2018a great store of treasure\u2019.[CITATION-59] His Anglo-Norman contemporary William of Malmesbury added the rumour that Gytha\u2019s wealth could in part be explained as a result of her activity as a slave trader with Denmark.[CITATION-60] Presumably some if not all of Gytha\u2019s wealth after her death went to Gunhild. We can get some idea of its size from the archive of St Donatian, which in the fourteenth century kept records of her bequest of gold and silver to the canons.In 1389 the bishop of Tournai approved the sale of(\u2018certain jewels\u2019 or \u2018precious objects\u2019) given by Lady Gunhild for the repair of the church\u2019s roof, vault and choir.[CITATION-61] More detail is provided under the same year in the annals published in 1561 by Jacobus Meyerus, a Bruges chronicler, which specified that Gunhild\u2019s gifts consisted of \u2018gold and silver\u2019.[CITATION-62] Meyerus also refers to a then extant Latin psalter known as Gunhild\u2019s psalter, which contained \u2018writings [glosses?] in Old English\u2019 (\u2018enarrationes linguae Saxonicae\u2019), \u2018which here nobody can understand\u2019.[CITATION-63] Meyerus\u2019s information was picked up in 1631 by Johannes Isacius Pontanus in his, where he supplemented it with details from Antonius Schoonhoven, a canon of St Donatian, who had consulted the archives of his house, presumably the paperwork from the sale in 1389. He reported that among the gifts Gunhild had given to the canons in her lifetime and at her death \u2018were among others an imperial crown () and many works of the best authors richly ornamented, of which the Psalter \u201cin the Danish language\u201d only remained\u2019.[CITATION-64] The most striking detail from Schoonhoven\u2019s archival work for us is the reference to a crown. Might this have been Harold\u2019s crown, which after his death was recovered by his mother and sister?[CITATION-65] If so, it must have been a prestigious possession for the canons of St Donatian in 1087. Equally, when the\u2014perhaps including a crown\u2014were sold to fund the substantial repairs to the church (roof, vault and choir), they must have been of enormous value. The transaction hints at the huge value of the portable wealth that the Godwine women possessed at the time of the Conquest.Yet there is one problem with this information in that, by the time of the sale in 1389, the canons (and therefore, later, Jacobus Meyerus) had forgotten who our Gunhild was. They confused her with another royal woman: Gunhild (d. 1038), daughter of King Cnut (1016\u201335) and Queen Emma (d. 1052) and, briefly, wife of Henry, later Emperor Henry III (1039\u201356).[CITATION-66] When this confusion originated cannot now be established. However, this misidentification in itself is strong evidence that the canons had no access to the information contained on Gunhild\u2019s plaque, which is unambiguous about her identity as the daughter of Earl Godwine and sister of King Harold. If a copy of Gunhild\u2019s obituary had been kept by the canons, perhaps as part of her liturgical commemoration, it got lost. In its absence, the scale and value of the bequest of Lady Gunhild was such that it was associated with a better-known imperial woman for whose wealth there would have been a more persuasive rationale than for the sister of a man who was king of England for only ten months.Gunhild\u2019s movable wealth may have been one reason for her move to Bruges, where the comital castle next to the church of St Donatian might have guaranteed her safety.[CITATION-67] In Saint-Omer the monks of Saint-Bertin provided \u2018banking\u2019 services that might have allowed Gytha and Gunhild to store their possessions in their safekeeping. It is well known that monastic houses acted as banks providing loans and mortgages from the eleventh century.[CITATION-68] From the mid-twelfth century there is evidence that all Peter\u2019s Pence collections from England were sent to the abbot of Saint-Bertin at Saint-Omer, who would organise its secure transport to Rome.[CITATION-69] In return, the monks of Saint-Bertin at Saint-Omer and the canons of St Donatian at Bruges would have expected to receive charitable donations from the English noblewomen. The canons in Bruges certainly did.[CITATION-70] Despite her wealth, Gunhild, having opted to become a woman religious, did not live a life of luxury in Bruges. As we have seen, her obituary records that, when still in England, \u2018as a young girl she took a vow of virginal chastity and wishing for a spiritual union she rejected marriage to several noble princes\u2019. If we take this information at face value, Gunhild had already chosen a life of religion before she went into exile. While in England she may have lived with her mother, or in a small community of like-minded religious women, but she never took the veil.[CITATION-71] Entry into a nunnery in Flanders, whether earlier on in the exile or after her return from Denmark, seems extremely unlikely. There was no nunnery in either Saint-Omer or Bruges, and in fact the only nunnery available in the county of Flanders would have been the recently founded one at Messines (Mesen) near Ypres.[CITATION-72] The most prominent veiled woman there between 1067 (the year of her husband Count Baldwin V\u2019s death) and her own death in August 1079 was Adela, dowager countess of Flanders, who was the mother of Queen Matilda, wife of William the Conqueror. There is no evidence that Adela made any effort to support Gytha or Gunhild when they arrived in 1068. This may be surprising in view of the fact that that Gytha and Adela had met when in 1051\u20132 the Godwine family spent a winter in Bruges.[CITATION-73] What, then, do we know about Gunhild\u2019s life as a woman religious at Bruges? This is what her obituary tells us:She piously loved Christ in her heart and she always honoured him righteously in her deeds. To those serving her she was cheerful and modest. She was benevolent and just towards strangers and generous to the poor. She was very restrained when it came to her body\u2014what should I say\u2014so restrained that she abstained from all pleasures and many years before the day she died she did not eat meat. She did not eat anything that seemed sweet to her but instead took only enough to stay alive. She wore a hair shirt and did not even show it to certain members of her household. In battling the vices she triumphed in the virtues.The text bears resemblance to hagiographical portrayals of women in female religious communities from Lotharingia (not Flanders) from the late tenth century onwards.[CITATION-74] The abstinence of luxurious food and sweets is mentioned for Ansoaldis of Maubeuge (1012\u201350), as depicted in the anonymous Life of her brother Theoderic of St Hubert written.1050.[CITATION-75] The hidden hair shirt reminds us of John of Gorze\u2019s vivid portrait of Geisa, a young woman whose hair shirt he felt as he touched her breast at the nunnery of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains at Metz.950.[CITATION-76] Both portrayals, it should be said, are of veiled women living in nunneries. Nevertheless, literary portraits like these, inspired by the Lotharingian reform movement of the late tenth and eleventh century, remind us also of those of women religious in England. In Lives written by the Flemish hagiographer Goscelin, formerly a monk of Saint-Bertin at Saint-Omer (d. after 1108) and active in England since the late 1060s, we learn about the nun Eve at Wilton, who.1080 became a recluse in exile at Angers, and Seitha, a resident recluse at Bury St Edmund\u2019s in the 1080s and 1090s.[CITATION-77] Gunhild\u2019s obituary, although much shorter than the other accounts, fits the same tradition. Whereas the longer lives of women religious were recorded \u2018publicly\u2019 and for posterity in hagiographical tracts preserved in monastic libraries, Gunhild\u2019s survives on her private lead plaque only. What these women religious in England and Lotharingia, and Gunhild in Flanders, shared was a relatively wealthy background, a single life (having rejected suitors) of extreme abstinence from food and of penitence (wearing hair shirts), and of intense religiosity in prayers (often from their own psalters) while living under the protection of male religious (which some paid for in kind or with wealth).[CITATION-78] While they all shared a life of penance, for Gunhild it is tempting to suggest a specific additional purpose.An important trope of the English tradition of memorialising post-Conquest defeat was that of divine punishment for the sins of the English.[CITATION-79] Gunhild, as a survivor of 1066, embodies quite literally that sense of English guilt. And although her obituary contains detailed biographical information, as we have seen, it is combined with her own strong sense of penance. The text starts with two abridged prayers, the Pater Noster and the Apostles\u2019 Creed, which are among the most common prayers Christians would know.[CITATION-80] The purpose of inserting them here was to testify to Gunhild\u2019s belief in God and to give evidence of her knowledge of them in the hope of absolution for her sins. The reference to her struggle with vice and overcoming it because of her virtue is a theme from Prudentius\u2019sthat recurs elsewhere in writings about the Godwine family. As Tom Licence has shown, thewritten for Queen Edith by a Flemish monk, probably Fulcard of Saint-Bertin at Saint-Omer, uses this theme to show that King Edward, his wife Edith (Gunhild\u2019s older sister) and Earl Godwine (Gunhild\u2019s father) triumphed in their struggle with vices in England, but that Harold and Tostig (Gunhild\u2019s brothers) did not.[CITATION-81] Gunhild\u2019s obituary bears testimony to the belief that she too was one of the Godwines who was virtuous, albeit in exile in Flanders.[CITATION-82] Who then was the author of Gunhild\u2019s obituary and who was or were his informers? It seems to me likely that a Flemish, rather than an English, clerk composed Gunhild\u2019s touching memorial portrait. Naturally, the suggestion of Flemish authorship does not preclude the possibility that the author was informed by Gunhild\u2019s servants. Her obituary twice refers to those who attended on her to illustrate how cheerful and kind she was to them but also how she concealed her hair shirt from some of them. Her household probably consisted of English women who had accompanied her mother and herself into exile in 1068, and perhaps some Flemish girls as well as male clergy. Among the latter, one name springs to mind as a possible informant and that is Blacmann.[CITATION-83] Originally a rich priest, he left England to accompany Gytha in 1068 as her chaplain. On his departure abroad he granted the island of Andersey in the river Thames, an important strategic site, to the monastery of Abingdon. King William blocked the move and kept it for himself, before later returning it to the monks. After Gytha\u2019s death, probably at Saint-Omer, Blacmann may have stayed on to provide Gunhild and the rest of her household with pastoral care. The obituary with its hagiographical tropes was probably composed by someone closely connected to the canons of St Donatian who wished to portray Gunhild as an exemplary woman religious who should be remembered in their community. If Gunhild\u2019s penitential lifestyle was chosen in part to atone for the sins of her family in England, the form her burial took could be taken as a reinforcement of her commitment in life and in death.Gunhild\u2019s burial place, immured in the wall of St Donatian church, suggests very strongly that she wished to be commemorated as a vowess, if not a recluse. This elite woman religious, who lost most of her family and all her lands in England and who had lived a life in exile, arranged with the canons of St Donatian that she be buried in their church.[CITATION-84] Undoubtedly, on this occasion she handed them such movable wealth as she still possessed, which, as we have seen, was of substantial value and would finance her commemoration.[CITATION-85] The earliest evidence for the site of her tomb comes from the 1389 record of the sale of her, which locates the tomb \u2018in the cloister\u2019 as part of the canons\u2019 confirmation to the bishop that her liturgical commemoration would continue. They included the directions \u2018that commendations be sung for her tomb in the cloister and that in that place the procession will stop\u2019.[CITATION-86] This record and the sixteenth-century evidence of Jacobus Meyerus are in line with the report of the discovery of the grave of Gunhild by G.F. Beltz in 1833. According to Meyerus in 1561 her tomb was situated \u2018next to the doorway on the north side of the church, her monument now obscured by a picture of the Virgin Mary\u2019.[CITATION-87] Apparently a plaque on blue stone was known to have been placed on the wall outside her tomb giving her name as Gunhild but with the wrong identification, as Gunhild, daughter of King Cnut and Queen Emma.[CITATION-88] From Beltz\u2019s report we learn that her coffin was indeed found buried in a very thick wall next to the doorway that led to the cloister of St Donatian with its graveyard. The position suggests that Gunhild in death was literally entombed in the church in a manner that reminds us of medieval recluses who lived and were buried in the churches where they led penitential lives, or in their graveyards.[CITATION-89] Was the mural burial a posthumous extension of Gunhild\u2019s penance in life for her own sins and those of her family? I would tentatively suggest that, upon her return from Denmark, Gunhild went to live with her servants somewhere in the grounds of St Donatian as a woman religious, perhaps a vowess or a recluse. Her obituary, however, does not describe her using the vocabulary of/unlike the obituaries on lead of Olardis (d. 1078) and Emma (d. 1124), two recluses at the monastery of Saint-Amand (Elnone) (now in the French D\u00e9partemente du Nord, part of medieval Flanders).[CITATION-90] The precise sites of their tombs are lost and therefore we do not know whether their tombs, like Gunhild\u2019s, were immured. No other evidence for immured burials in eleventh-century Flanders has survived. At Bruges the only testimony to a hermit or recluse is that of Everelmus, who died in 1060 in a small church he built south of the burgh (the fortress), near the count\u2019s fishpond.[CITATION-91] The combination of her bequest to the canons, its associated wish to be commemorated, and her actual burial site strongly suggests that Gunhild herself was involved in plans for her burial as well as the text for her lead plaque obituary.Finally, what does the evidence for the career of Gunhild, sister of King Harold, as we have been able to reconstruct it, contribute to the knowledge we have about royal English women? Several of them were married off. If the career of Gunhild\u2019s niece Gunhild, Harold\u2019s daughter and grandmother of William d\u2019Aincourt, is anything to go by, an initial stay in a religious community before or after the Norman Conquest would not necessarily have precluded later marriage. After 1066 the younger Gunhild spent a few years at the nunnery of Wilton. Whether her entry there was out of choice or out of \u2018fear for the French\u2019, a scenario discussed by Lanfranc in relation to elite English women who had sought refuge in monasteries, we do not know.[CITATION-92] She left Wilton and married.1075 the Breton noble Alan Rufus, lord of Richmond, who died in 1093; she was then approached by his brother Alan the Black (d. 1096 x 1098).[CITATION-93] After the Conquest (inter-) marriage was used as a tool on a modest scale by William the Conqueror to marry off English widows and heiresses to his followers, not least to legitimate their holding of English lands.[CITATION-94] In the younger Gunhild\u2019s case the Conqueror allowed her to inherit lands from her mother Eadgifu Swanneck (d. after 1066), a rich Anglo-Saxon heiress from East Anglia and King Harold\u2019s first wife.[CITATION-95] Some of her lands then formally passed on to the Aincourts through inheritances sanctioned by the Norman kings. These arrangements included protection for little William d\u2019Aincourt, who was offered an education at the court of William Rufus. Perhaps the fosterage was something of a goodwill gesture towards the descendants of his father\u2019s adversary King Harold, or a hostage situation to prevent William\u2019s father Walter from causing trouble on behalf of his wife\u2019s royal ancestor. Marriage was also used for Margaret (d. 1092), a great-granddaughter of King Aethelred (d. 1016), who in.1068 married King Malcolm of Scotland in an alliance that had been initiated by Edward the Confessor.[CITATION-96] The single life was an alternative scenario for some royal women, perhaps depending on their stage in the life cycle and the reputation of their protector. After the death of her husband King Edward, Queen Edith (d. 1075) surrendered to King William, who allowed her to keep her dower lands as the widow of a king whom William recognised. She retired to Winchester but regularly spent time at the nunnery of Wilton.[CITATION-97] A hoard of coins bearing the late King Harold\u2019s name, containing a large number minted at Wilton in the autumn of 1066, has prompted the suggestion that Edith was involved in the design of the dies and issue of the coins, an action that could be construed as against the interests of the new king.[CITATION-98] As a gesture to King Edward\u2019s memory, the Conqueror did not interfere with the lands that Edward had assigned to his sister Goda (d. after 1066), widow of Count Drogo of Vexin (d. 1035) and divorced from Eustace II of Boulogne since the early 1050s. Goda spent her final years after the Conquest as a single woman at Lambeth near London.[CITATION-99] Another of Edward\u2019s paternal cousins, Christina, sister of Queen Margaret of Scotland, remained in England and was attached to the royal nunneries of Romsey and Wilton.[CITATION-100] Thus, whether they were related to his acknowledged predecessor or his defeated predecessor, royal women received support from William the Conqueror as long as they toed the line.The fates of a group of women associated with Harold, of whom Gunhild was one, merit special attention. When Harold died at Hastings, his second wife Ealdgyth of Mercia, widow of King Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (d. 1064), was in London, from where her brothers, earls Eadwin and Morcar, collected her and took her to relative safety in Chester.[CITATION-101] This is the last we hear of her; we do not know what happened to her after the fall of Chester and that of her brothers in 1070.[CITATION-102] With Queen Edith having been powerless to protect her mother Gytha and sister Gunhild, both held out with other noble women against the Conqueror for two years. Unfortunately the identities of these noble women are unknown. As we have seen, by 1068 their position in England had become untenable and remaining defiant in exile was their only option.[CITATION-103] Did they expect that Flanders might again be a springboard for a return home, just as it had been in 1051\u20132? If they had Harold\u2019s crown among their possessions, what might they have hoped for? A coronation for a son of Harold?These questions raise the issue of the fate of elite Englishmen and in particular Harold\u2019s sons. As experienced fighters, when capable, they were inclined to revenge their father. The sons who could not do so were Wulf, in captivity in Normandy but released in 1087, and Ealdgyth\u2019s unnamed son (perhaps named Harold), born in 1066.[CITATION-104] The sons who could had fled to Ireland, another safe haven for the Godwines from the recent past.[CITATION-105] From there in 1068 Godwine, Edmund and Magnus attacked first Bristol and then Somerset, but were defeated in both places.[CITATION-106] The next year two unnamed sons landed on the Dorset coast at the mouth of the Taw but were again pushed back.[CITATION-107] A son called Harold found refuge at the royal court in Norway and in 1098 accompanied King Magnus III on a raid on Anglesey.[CITATION-108] Thereafter Harold\u2019s sons disappear from view.Among royal men there was also King Edward\u2019s kinsman Edgar the aetheling, who in 1066 was for a mere few weeks recognised as his successor.[CITATION-109] Initially he was protected by the Conqueror and kept under close watch at his court, for similar reasons to those that kept little William d\u2019Aincourt at the court of William Rufus. But then Edgar allied himself variously with Anglo-Saxon resistance fighters, with his brother-in-law King Malcolm of Scotland, and others. Ultimately, he disappeared from view only to re-emerge during the First Crusade, from which he returned to retire to Somerset, where he died in the early twelfth century.The decision by Gytha and Gunhild to go into exile, and to remain on the Continent, was an act of defiance against the new Norman king of England. It was in line with the exile of Harold\u2019s sons and with previous Godwine family experiences of seeking refuge overseas. In terms of the fates of royal women in England, including Queen Edith, the flight of the widow and her single daughter to Flanders was exceptional. In the first instance they wished to safeguard their movable wealth (perhaps including Harold\u2019s crown) in order to finance a future return to England. Exile also may have safeguarded Gunhild\u2019s choice to live a life as a religious woman, a status which, had she remained in England, might have been compromised by the Normans. In Flanders, living under the protection of its counts, and with Gytha dead, Gunhild\u2019s temporary move abroad became a permanent one. On her own death Gunhild donated the family wealth to the canons of St Donatian at Bruges in return for the concession that she be entombed in the wall of their church as an act of penance. It is at this stage of her life that she emerges from obscurity in her Latin obituary on lead. This records, apart from her penance, her pride in her English elite ancestry. The unusual, near-hagiographical portrayal of Gunhild is the longest eleventh-century text of its kind on lead for a lay woman in western Europe. As such it provides a unique female testimony to an English royal woman\u2019s life abroad in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest.Gunhild\u2019s plaque is registered with the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage Belgium, KIK-IRPA, Brussels, object no. 144772, and clich\u00e9 no. Z011814. Measurements are 24.5 cm x 19.5\u201320.5 cm. The plate is kept in the treasury of St Salvator\u2019s cathedral in Brussels.My edition is based on the photograph of the plaque as published by Luc Devliegher.

Gunhild, born of most noble parents was English. Her father was Earl Godwin who held a very large part of England under his military command and her mother Gytha was born of famous Danish ancestry. As a young girl she took a vow of virginal chastity and wishing for a spiritual union she rejected marriage to several noble princes. She had already reached marriageable age when England was conquered by William, count of the Normans, who slew her brother Harold, king of the English. She fled her homeland and lived for some years in exile at Saint-Omer in Flanders. She piously loved Christ in her heart and she always honoured him righteously in her deeds. To those serving her she was cheerful and modest. She was benevolent and just towards strangers and generous to the poor. She was very restrained when it came to her body\u2014what should I say\u2014so restrained that she abstained from all pleasures and many years before the day she died she did not eat meat. She did not eat anything that seemed sweet to her but instead took only enough to stay alive. She wore a hair shirt and did not even show it to certain members of her household. In battling the vices she triumphed in the virtues. She then went to Bruges where she lived for a few years and from there crossed to Denmark. She returned here and died a virgin in the year 1087 on the 24th of August on the twenty-second day of the new moon."

    "text": "The apparent contradictions of British politics in the early nineteenth century have long confounded historians. Lord Liverpool\u2019s ministry (1812\u201327) vehemently, and often violently, rejected constitutional change. Yet it simultaneously implemented a raft of improvements in governance. We argue here that empire is key to resolving this conundrum. Particularly from 1822, the Liverpool ministry launched a constitutional overhaul of empire through one of the most ambitious information-gathering efforts undertaken by the British imperial state: commissions of inquiry. Creatures of the royal prerogative, these investigations amassed \u2018on the spot\u2019 information to underpin genuine conservative interventions into colonial law and governance. At the same time, they curated colonial controversy in order to subvert hostile parliamentary interference at a time when Liverpool\u2019s hold on power was particularly tenuous. Inquiry and reform were profoundly shaped by the delicate dance of Crown and parliament. By exploring three moments of controversy in New South Wales, Jamaica and the Cape Colony between 1819 and 1826, we argue that colonial royal commissions showcase the workings of Tory innovation by laying bare the mix of reformism, conservatism and pragmatism that undergirded this unstable regime.Lord Liverpool\u2019s ministry (1812\u201327) has long proved fascinating to historians of British politics. Led by a man not noted for his charisma and constantly challenged by internal divisions, the regime enjoyed unlikely longevity amid the political upheaval between the Napoleonic Wars and the Great Reform Act. Apparently riddled with contradictions, it embraced authoritarianism in the face of global revolution at the same time as it undertook significant social and legal reforms. It was a government that crushed dissent and deployed military violence on a large scale to manage domestic unrest, most notoriously in the Peterloo Massacre of 1819. Yet it also oversaw a raft of improvements targeting corruption, the wrong sort of patronage and post-war spending, while shifting gears on finance, the penal system and foreign policy. Scholars have struggled to discern the convictions of its leaders and the vagaries of its policies, particularly in relation to questions of liberalism and reform.[CITATION-1] Those investigating the liberal elements of Liverpool\u2019s government have sought its complex ideological underpinnings in evangelicalism, political economy, free trade and an emergent middle-class challenge to the landed interest. Others point to fear and pragmatism as key drivers of conservative reform\u2014noting the regime\u2019s anxiety about public opinion, parliamentary defections and dismissal.[CITATION-2] After all, the ministry\u2019s position was constitutionally and politically precarious. Few observers anticipated either the length or the success of Liverpool\u2019s government after Spencer Perceval\u2019s assassination catapulted him into office in 1812.[CITATION-3] Holding the favour of the Prince Regent, subsequently George IV, was not easy. After a long association with the Foxite Whigs, as regent the Prince of Wales turned to his father\u2019s ministers to form a government in 1811. Though he never returned to the allies of his youth, George\u2019s relationship with these ministries was frequently vexed.[CITATION-4] This mattered because, more than a century after the Glorious Revolution, the king had not quite been tamed by parliament. Hopeful ministers still had to curry royal favour in order to take office. Only after William IV\u2019s last and pyrrhic dismissal of the Melbourne Whig ministry in 1834 did ministries ordinarily take power, not by royal fiat, but by commanding a majority of parliament.[CITATION-5] Liverpool\u2019s hold on parliament was similarly precarious. The structure and discipline of a two-party system were only beginning to emerge in this period. Allegiances remained personal and highly factionalised. To speak of \u2018Whigs\u2019 and \u2018Tories\u2019 in the period of Perceval and Liverpool is arguably anachronistic, though a commonly used scholarly convenience.[CITATION-6] It can be justified if both sides are recognised as a set of (often fractious) alliances in which personal affinity generally trumped \u2018party\u2019 in the later nineteenth-century sense of that word. While the idea of a government and an opposition was beginning to gain acceptance in the first decades of the nineteenth century, Liverpool\u2019s supporters comprised a broad church with diverse interests and attitudes. The loyalty of backbenchers could never be assumed. After the death in 1806 of William Pitt the Younger and the collapse of the short-lived Ministry of All the Talents thereafter, the men who (broadly speaking) saw themselves as Pitt\u2019s heirs held the ministry until the 1830s. Yet, by the second decade of the nineteenth century, they were an increasingly fragile collective, one that would be torn apart by the issue of Catholic emancipation in 1827. The more centrist elements of the opposition Whigs threatened to woo defectors and erode the government\u2019s authority. In this context, the Liverpool ministry\u2019s pivot towards cautious reforms (particularly after Castlereagh\u2019s suicide in 1822) was not only the product of a more stable economic and geopolitical context: it might also be cast as a concession to unruly allies. In Boyd Hilton\u2019s pointed assessment, for \u2018a few brief decades in English history, what was said in the Commons actually swayed the outcome of legislation\u2019.[CITATION-7] While the question of Ireland and Catholic emancipation has long exercised scholars of this period, we argue here that the wider empire is a key and neglected piece of the puzzle of reform in early nineteenth-century Tory governance. Empire showcases the workings of Tory innovation by laying bare the mix of reformism, conservatism and pragmatism that undergirded this unstable regime. Though few historians of early nineteenth-century British domestic politics discuss empire,[CITATION-8] arguably the most ambitious and dramatic reforms overseen by the Liverpool ministry unfolded in Britain\u2019s colonial peripheries.[CITATION-9] Particularly from 1822, the colonial administration began, but did not manage to complete, the wholesale constitutional and legal reform of empire. Imperial reform was filtered through the most ambitious information-gathering effort ever undertaken by the British imperial state: colonial commissions of inquiry dispatched almost everywhere investigated all aspects of governance in some colonies and the laws and administration of justice of others.[CITATION-10] We suggest that empire in the moment of inquiry proffers several important lessons about the nature and commitments of the British ministry in the age of Liverpool. The reorganisation of empire as imagined through commissions of inquiry points a way through what Zo\u00eb Laidlaw has characterised as \u2018a gradual, and often haphazard, transition\u2019 from colonial despotisms to responsible government.[CITATION-11] In the 1820s, modes of autocratic rule that had proliferated in empire after 1774 facilitated (albeit inconsistently) reforms focused on doing justice, expanding the rule of law and protecting the enslaved.[CITATION-12] In investigating empire, moreover, commissions of inquiry exemplify what Anna Gambles has identified as the essence of conservative reform, privileging experience over radical experiment in the remaking of colonial states.[CITATION-13] Viewed in this light, imperial reform was never purely reactionary: it reflected Tory proclivities and was made possible by counter-revolutionary colonial rule. However, imperial reform was reactionary too: it exemplified the precarities of the Liverpool ascendancy. As we demonstrate here, inquiry and reform were profoundly shaped by the delicate dance of Crown and parliament. The loose bonds of allegiance that helped to keep Liverpool (and Perceval before him) in power threatened to unravel at any moment into bills and motions that might transform empire.We explore this interface of reformism and pragmatism through three moments when parliament, the Colonial Office and the commissions of inquiry intersected. In the first moment (1819), a commission of inquiry already deployed by Secretary of State Lord Bathurst to inquire into the state of New South Wales was leveraged to try to avoid, or at least to delay, parliamentary scrutiny of the management of the colony. This impulse carried over into the announcement of what became an empire-wide inquiry in July 1822. In the second (unfolding from 1824), Commissioners of Legal Inquiry in the Caribbean were sent explicit instructions to bury an explosive controversy about the exile of free men of colour from Jamaica. That effort ended badly, but shows very clearly the Colonial Office\u2019s wariness of parliamentary scrutiny of the colonial politics of free-coloured subjecthood on the cusp of emancipation. In the third (exactly contemporaneous) example, the Commission of Eastern Inquiry was one of a series of tools deployed to avert parliamentary discussion of Governor Lord Charles Somerset\u2019s public and private antics in the Cape. The incident reveals more than a cover-up. Even as the Colonial Office struggled to bury controversy, the episode also shows the ministry\u2019s commitment both to reforming and defending colonial autocracy. Strategic improvements in this sphere would not only make proconsular despots more accountable, and therefore defensible, they would also root out behaviour that could compromise the Liverpool administration\u2019s claims to probity. These incidents together illustrate the complex overlay of genuine reform with political pragmatism in Liverpool\u2019s empire.The architect of imperial transformation through inquiry, and the real founder of the nineteenth-century Colonial Office, was the self-effacing Henry Bathurst, third earl Bathurst (secretary of state for war and the colonies, 1812\u201327). When Bathurst resigned his cabinet position after George Canning became prime minister in 1827, Palmerston (writing in the bitterness of the Catholic emancipation debates of 1826) dismissed him as one of the \u2018old stumped-up Tories\u2019.[CITATION-14] Yet the man himself was far more complex than this suggests, and historians have rightly emphasised Bathurst\u2019s shrewdness.[CITATION-15] Like the topic of empire more generally, Bathurst himself is frequently absent from political histories of Liverpool\u2019s ministry. Yet his organisation of the Colonial Office is emblematic of the cautious pragmatism that characterised the reforms of global import that were enacted across this period.[CITATION-16] As we have argued, the loose bonds of \u2018party\u2019 made the legislative outcome of debates in the House of Commons extremely difficult to control. This was only exacerbated by increasingly cross-partisan attacks on patronage and the decline of an eighteenth-century system of influence.[CITATION-17] In this transitional moment, Liverpool\u2019s government also faced vociferous calls for post-war retrenchment from Whigs and Radicals, mostly stridently in the voice of Joseph Hume who, together with Henry Brougham, became a magnet for colonial complaints against the incumbent administration. With anti-slavery sentiment increasingly pervasive among the British public by the mid-1820s, those named variously as \u2018Abolitionists\u2019 and \u2018Saints\u2019 in Colonial Office correspondence also ran constant, and increasingly threatening, interference from the House of Commons.[CITATION-18] Such lobbyists and public interest groups took advantage of a trend towards increasing public participation in politics, a shift fuelled by the accelerating growth of the periodical press and the publication of parliamentary debates.[CITATION-19] Whatever Bathurst thought of the legitimacy of public opinion, he was fully alive to its power. This recognition, and the interface between the ministry and the Commons, were both central to the method and practice of Colonial Office governance in the period of the commissions.[CITATION-20] The rising threat of these groups runs through Colonial Office correspondence of all types. The most candid complaints arise in private correspondence, a category of semi-official correspondence created by Bathurst and his under-secretaries to keep certain colonial affairs out of parliament.[CITATION-21] Bathurst, for example, complained privately of \u2018our subjection to the Saints\u2019 in a confidential letter to his under-secretary in 1826, underscoring that, by this period, this was a lobby group perceived to be of sufficient strength to need conciliation rather than management.[CITATION-22] Equally problematic were endless criticisms of government spending and Crown rule made by Joseph Hume and his allies. In one candid exchange, Bathurst fumed to the under-secretary of state Robert Wilmot Horton (in office 1821\u201327) that Hume was \u2018a prodigious puppy\u2019 in his \u2018meditated attack upon the colonies\u2019 and instructed his under-secretaries to give the Radical member \u2018a proper drubbing\u2019 by letter.[CITATION-23] Newly conquered possessions (later known as Crown Colonies) formed targets in debates over spending, with Hume invoking parliament\u2019s \u2018constitutional jealousy\u2019 of the royal prerogative to bolster complaints about their cost.[CITATION-24] It was with such interference in mind that Bathurst reined in colonial governors who overstepped the bounds of their power in ways that were liable to raise domestic political hackles.Wilmot Horton, who spoke for the Colonial Office in the House of Commons during the height of the commission investigations, approached the problem from a different angle. While he was a similarly adept manipulator of the system of private versus public correspon\u00addence, he considered Bathurst\u2019s strategy of minimising parliamentary debate over colonial affairs, especially the \u2018Slave Question\u2019, to be counter-productive.[CITATION-25] In letters to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in March and April 1824, Wilmot Horton complained of effectively being under a gagging order. \u2018Silence is universallyto me. It is no wonder that Hume characterises the Department as the most inefficient in the whole range of Government\u2019.[CITATION-26] The under-secretary\u2019s complaints clearly registered, as did his assertion that he could avoid getting the government into \u2018a scrape\u2019 if given a freer rein.[CITATION-27] Wilmot Horton\u2019s voice becomes far more evident in debates over colonial reform in the House of Commons from the middle of 1825, deflecting opposition attacks through a variety of delaying and obfuscating tactics.Royal Commissions were a key weapon in the arsenal of Bathurst\u2019s Colonial Office, deployed to calculated effect in managing interference from unpredictable parliamentary forces. They were well suited to demonstrating a commitment to the reform of colonial law and gover\u00adnance that was tied firmly to the weight of evidence and experience. They were arguably also a natural fit for an administration intent on maintaining the Crown\u2019s power against populist parliamentary encroachment, for all that Tory notions of monarchical authority were being tempered by a post-revolutionary context.[CITATION-28] Commissioners embodied the royal prerogative in the colonies. Within the scope of their authority, they outranked colonial governors.[CITATION-29] Unlike parliamentary inquiries held in London which were usually led by opinionated politicians, commissions were staffed by Crown appointees issued with Crown instructions. Their inquiries were designed, vetted and curated by the Crown for parliament. Finally, commissions were slow. Parliamentary demands could be delayed, even thwarted, by the promise to send men across the world to gather information and report. In practice they reported directly to the Secretary of State, under whose auspices their instructions were framed, their priorities determined, and their reports and recommendations parsed before they reached parliament. All of these offered opportunities for strategic management.The first of these new commissions was deployed to the colony of New South Wales.[CITATION-30] This quirky outpost had become a widespread source of concern. Formed as a dumping ground for British (and some colonial) criminals, by the late 1810s New South Wales\u2019s rapidly evolving economy made it look much more like a land of economic opportunity than a prison. The process of transporting and governing convicts abroad was horrendously expensive, and a growing number of parliamentarians wondered why the public was funding a haven for felons. Letting them live at large, marry informally, set up businesses and even take public office seemed unsuitable to proponents of both order and moral reform. Saints and Utilitarians preferred their prisoners confined, surveilled and in a constant state of instructive misery. Radicals and West India men saw New South Wales as a bellwether of Crown tyranny. For their part, conservatives, including Bathurst, wanted New South Wales to disincentivise both crime and temptations to revolution at home.[CITATION-31] These overlapping and contradictory concerns were of long standing. The peculiarities of the penal colony of New South Wales had already formed the subject of two parliamentary Select Committees (in 1798 and 1812). The latter had caused the government some embarrassment, particularly when it raised the prospect of introducing trial by jury and more representative institutions. But the problem of the colony came to a head after 1815. Reports from the colony itself had the governor, Lachlan Macquarie (1810\u201321) pushing numerous buttons of metropolitan anxiety. A growing and assertive free population accused Macquarie (who exercised almost limitless power) of tyranny. They alleged that he was recklessly spending government money on a magnificent programme of public works. They bridled against hard limits he had placed on colonial expansion, seeking more economic opportunities for themselves. Worst of all, they accused him of bias towards convicts and former convicts (who had been pardoned or whose terms had expired).Bathurst read myriad complaints about New South Wales with genuine concern. He wrote to Sidmouth in April 1817 to say that the colony\u2019s prosperity and the enormous increase in the number of convicts transported there meant that it was no longer fit for purpose. New settlers resisted penal regulations as impositions on their liberties \u2018as British Subjects\u2019, while the government could only deal with the mass of convicts by letting many live independently and work for wages. He feared that \u2018Transportation to New South Wales is becoming neither an object of Apprehension here nor the means of reformation in the Settlement itself, and that the Settlement must be either placed upon a Footing which shall render it possible to enforce, with respect to all the Convicts, strict Discipline, Regular Labour, and constant Superintendence, or the System of unlimited Transportation to New South Wales must be abandoned\u2019. True to Tory form, before Bathurst proposed a radical reform he sought better information. To this end he proposed sending a commissioner to investigate \u2018all the Complaints which have been made both with respect to the Treatment of the Convicts, and the General Administration of the Government\u2019, to suggest improvements and report on their potential cost to \u2018the Public\u2019.[CITATION-32] Bathurst wanted to fix New South Wales, but he also had an eye on parliament. The situation of New South Wales\u2014bringing together as it did an explosive mix of spiralling costs, moral decay, and issues of law and order at home and despotism abroad\u2014threatened to unite a dangerously diverse set of political interests.[CITATION-33] By dispatching a commissioner to distant Sydney, Bathurst could control the rate and direction of reform more directly. So John Thomas Bigge was appointed in 1818 to inquire into the state of the colony. Bigge had been the Chief Justice of Trinidad, and thus had some colonial experience. The appointment, Bathurst hoped, would give him both information and breathing space.Bathurst\u2019s second goal very nearly failed. Even as Bigge was packing for Australia, the inquiry got caught up in the dance of Crown and parliament. Henry Grey Bennet, Whig MP for Shrewsbury and another conduit for colonial complaints, led the charge, both in print and in a series of telling parliamentary debates in early 1819 that threatened to wrest the reform of New South Wales from the ministry and place it in the hands of a parliamentary committee.[CITATION-34] In February, Bennet regaled the Commons with sensational allegations of Macquarie\u2019s gubernatorial tyranny and convict debauchery gleaned from his friend and Sydney correspondent, the Reverend Samuel Marsden. Such grave allegations should not be left to investigation by a commissioner, however \u2018humane or intelligent\u2019, argued Bennet.[CITATION-35] They required parliamentary scrutiny. So Bennet moved for the appointment of a parliamentary committee into both the system of transportation and the state of the colony of New South Wales.Lord Castlereagh (leader of the house and secretary of state for foreign affairs) and Henry Goulburn (Wilmot-Horton\u2019s predecessor as under-secretary at the Colonial Office), parried the call in equally telling terms. Both supported the principle of inquiry, but Castlereagh waxed comical on Bennet\u2019s enthusiasm for parliamentary inquiry, reminding the House that Bennet had already called for inquiries into banks and currency exchange. Bigge\u2019s inquiry would be preferable, he insisted, as he could report fully with data gathered \u2018on the spot\u2019.[CITATION-36] To spike the opposition guns, Castlereagh counter-proposed parliamentary select committees into the state of the gaols and penal law, with remits so broad that they would be entirely unable to come up with a detailed set of recommendations.In response, the Whigs accused the ministry of \u2018man\u0153uvr[ing]\u2019 to avoid an inquiry into transportation and New South Wales. George Tierney, MP for Knaresborough and leader of the opposition in the Commons, complained that \u2018It was quite clear that the noble lord and his colleagues were anxious to avoid all inquiry, under the pretence of the most full and ample investigation\u2019.[CITATION-37] Despite such objections, Castlereagh\u2019s gambit neatly side-tracked the debate from the topic of New South Wales and into the composition of two new and very general select committees.[CITATION-38] Although Bennet and other members of the Select Committee on Gaols tried to instruct Bigge before he left England, the government held control of the inquiry into New South Wales.[CITATION-39] Fobbing off parliamentary intervention was not the same as rejecting calls for reform, however. The object of Castlereagh\u2019s parliamentary inquiry and Bathurst\u2019s commission was merely to avert parliamentary scrutiny of New South Wales until the ministry was ready to propose mature reforms. And, indeed, the New South Wales Inquiry precipitated epochal change in the colony. Some of this change followed shifts in Crown policy. At the request of settler elites, Bigge recommended an enormous escalation in land grants and the mass transfer of convict labour from government and town to private employment on agricultural and pastoral frontiers. These shifts helped secure New South Wales\u2019s place as one of the fastest growing economies in history.[CITATION-40] Parliament played a role also, legislating constitutional reforms more radical than Commissioner Bigge imagined. The New South Wales Act of 1823 ignored Bigge\u2019s recommendation to retain the colony\u2019s truncated judicial system and unfettered gubernatorial autocracy, instead creating a Supreme Court and an appointed legislative and executive council.[CITATION-41] This structure became a template for Crown Colonies throughout the empire.The parliamentary exchange about the New South Wales Inquiry was not a one-off. Indeed, the whole project of pan-imperial inquiry had its origins in the dance between Crown and parliament. A series of less pointed, but even more consequential tussles about controlling imperial reform replayed in 1821, culminating in the ministry\u2019s 1822 announcement that it would inquire into almost all British colonies.[CITATION-42] As with debates about New South Wales in 1819, the debates that precipitated the deployment of commissions almost everywhere demonstrated the growing strength and diverse interests of lobbyists attacking everything from colonial slavery to colonial expenses. Imperial reform could make for strange political bedfellows.[CITATION-43] The first pan-Caribbean inquiry announced in 1821 was sent after William Wilberforce accused Caribbean customs officers and masters of re-enslaving Africans \u2018liberated\u2019 from slave ships and indentured in the West Indies under the terms of the Abolition Act of 1807.[CITATION-44] Within months of Wilberforce\u2019s allegations, Bathurst had commissioned an inquiry into the state of liberated Africans throughout the West Indies. In the same year, the former governor of Jamaica (1801\u20135), anti-slavery advocate and Whig MP, George Nugent (Lord Nugent), unsuccessfully moved that a select committee be established to inquire into the administration of justice in Tobago. Slavery was central here also: Nugent\u2019s call invoked reports from the former Attorney General, Benjamin Capper, of \u2018flagrant denials of justices, and indeed \u2026 great personal cruelty\u2019 in the island.[CITATION-45] By 1822, Nugent had escalated to a motion to reform the administration of justice in the Leeward Islands.[CITATION-46] Nugent\u2019s 1822 motion showed the catholicism of his interests: Tobago, after all, was not a Leeward Island, and his speech in support ranged far beyond the dysfunctions of slavery. His bid for reform focused much more on the deleterious impact of manager-dominated courts on commerce and, in particular, the impediments posed to debt recovery and trade by colonial courts whose judges were paid by jealous legislatures comprised of men who would be deemed unfit for election at home. The result was that creditors, absentee landowners and the enslaved could not expect justice according to law.[CITATION-47] Nugent\u2019s gesture threatened to galvanise the House. Creditors of all political persuasions railed against the incompetence and pro-debtor politics of Caribbean courts. So the government cut a deal with Nugent: in return for the bill\u2019s withdrawal, Wilmot Horton announced the government\u2019s intention to establish a commission of inquiry into the administration of justice in the Leeward Islands.Hume made the cross-chamber appeal of legal inquiry crystal clear when he supported Nugent\u2019s motion and sought to amend it to include the island of Trinidad. The West India champion Joseph Marryat seconded Hume\u2019s motion, calling for an inquiry into taxation, governance and the administration of law in the island. The problem in Trinidad, according to Marryat, was the continued administration of Spanish law, which was structurally unjust and improperly applied by ignorant judges. But Marryat sought more than legal reform. He also hoped a commission might expose the autocratic despotism of Crown government in Trinidad and smooth the way for the introduction of self-government, as well as British law, in the island. Hume withdrew his amendment when Wilmot Horton promised that appropriate papers about the colony would be tabled before the House. Nevertheless, a year later, the Colonial Office quietly instructed the commissioners of legal inquiry to investigate law, the administration of justice and controversial land resumptions (but not the structure of government) in Trinidad.[CITATION-48] Meanwhile, the Saints had been in Bathurst\u2019s ear about slavery in the Cape. On 25 July 1822, Wilberforce rose to laud the government for establishing a slave registry and making land grants conditional on the employment of free rather than slave labour in their cultivation. But he called for more to be done. The thinly scattered population of the Cape made registration difficult; laws regulating free labour were inadequate; and limits on the use of slave labour on new land grants did not apply to domestic slaves. He feared that slavery was still thriving in the Cape and its proximity to slave-trading principalities meant there was \u2018reason to apprehend\u2019 that slave-trading might thrive in new settlements \u2018now forming in Africa, if slavery shall be permitted there as a state recognized by law\u2019.[CITATION-49] Wilmot Horton denied that the Cape was likely to become \u2018a great mart for slaves\u2019, and resisted calls to make new landholders manumit their slaves.[CITATION-50] Instead, he announced a commission of inquiry into the Cape. At the same time, he also announced an inquiry into Ceylon and Mauritius, a notorious slave-trading hub. While these were not the last of the commissions established by the Liverpool ministry, the guts of the project of pan-imperial inquiry were thus announced in a single day. It was done, at least in part, to put out multiple fires in parliament.The Commission of Legal Inquiry in the West Indies began with a narrow brief. Reneging on its promise in parliament, the government first tasked the commissioners with looking into criminal law, particularly that pertaining to slavery. However, this truncated brief included the Windward as well as the Leeward Islands. And its content and scope grew rapidly: even before the commissioners left England, the Colonial Office\u2019s commitment to reform outstripped its efforts to placate parliament. In a flurry of public and private letters, Bathurst instructed the first commission also to inquire into the administration of civil justice, the qualifications of judges, and a proposal for the wholesale restructure of the court system in the Leeward and Windward Islands. Within months of the commissioners\u2019 arrival in Barbados, the Colonial Office had decided to expand the inquiry to Trinidad. By the time a new commissioner was sent out in 1823, he brought instructions to inquire into the rest of the West Indies.The legal commissioners moved through the islands at remarkable speed and with remarkably little fuss. The New South Wales and Cape inquiries took years and the Commission of Inquiry into Liberated Africans imploded three times. Not so the West Indian legal inquiry, which completed its investigation of twenty Caribbean colonies and settlements in just three and a half years. Though the first commissioners, Fortunatis Dwarris and Henry Maddock, were each accused of either anti- or pro- slavery sympathies, the commissioners largely avoided controversy.[CITATION-51] Also, their core recommendations got real traction with Crown and parliament, though they had limited effect on the ground. The commissioners\u2019 informal recommendation for a slave code was put into immediate effect in Trinidad. Soon after, the Trinidad Ordinance was adapted and adopted in other Crown Colonies and (with less effect) folded into model legislation which most self-governing colonies refused to pass.[CITATION-52] Their recommendations for the streamlining and professionalising of courts were popular on all sides of the House but were not passed into imperial law until after emancipation. When it was eventually passed, the West Indies Judicature Act of 1836 was never implemented because no one would pay for it.[CITATION-53] Instead, a pale shadow of court restructure was imposed on Trinidad, Saint Lucia and what became British Guiana. Whatever the outcomes, with a few notable exceptions, the Legal Commission was widely respected in parliament and the press.[CITATION-54] The commissioners ran out of luck in Jamaica, however: no task proved more contentious than the case of Louis Celeste Lecesne and John Escoffery.[CITATION-55] On 18 June 1825 Lord Bathurst and Robert Wilmot Horton both put pen to paper to announce a new task for the Caribbean commissioners in private and confidential letters to the Duke of Manchester, the governor of Jamaica. Two days earlier, a heated debate in the House of Commons had threatened \u2018incalculable injury \u2026 to the character of West Indian Legislatures\u2019 as well as to the home government.[CITATION-56] The matter concerned the exile of Lecesne and Escoffery from the island of Jamaica, two free people of colour who claimed they were British subjects but who had been deported as aliens. This case had been brewing since late 1823, when Lecesne and Escoffery, along with an associate, John Gonville, were deported from Jamaica to Haiti, the independent republic created by the only successful modern slave rebellion that haunted the nightmares of Britain\u2019s planter class. In the midst of mobilisation by free people of colour for civil rights in Jamaica, the renewal of abolitionist activism in Britain and white paranoia about slave insurrection across the Caribbean, these men were declared aliens and \u2018dangerous to the Peace and tranquillity of the Island\u2019.[CITATION-57] They were accused by the colonial government of plotting with emissaries from Haiti to overthrow the government of Jamaica, and of conspiring to arm rebellious slaves to the same end. Their supporters would later argue (with justification) that they were deported for their civil rights activism, not for sedition.All three men were closely connected by family and community, the children of white fathers and black mothers who had fled the revolution in Saint Domingue/Haiti in the 1790s. Gonville never disputed that he was born in Haiti, but Lecesne and Escoffery insisted that they were born in Jamaica. As British subjects, they claimed to be exempt from the Aliens Act that authorised their deportation. Their claims to subjecthood were confirmed when the Court of Grand Sessions (Jamaica\u2019s Supreme Court) issued a writ ofrequiring their release. Manchester responded by convening a secret committee of legislators to investigate the matter, and, deploying the wide discretionary powers held by the executive under Jamaica\u2019s alien legislation, re-arrested and deported Lecesne and Escoffery by executive order.[CITATION-58] Having managed to get themselves to London, Lecesne, Escoffery and Gonville made contact with newly reinvigorated British anti-slavery campaigners who quickly recognised their usefulness. As respectable free merchants and family men, they raised no controversial issues of emancipation or even amelioration. As a court had found that Lecesne and Escoffery were British subjects, they also presented the spectre of Jamaica\u2019s reckless disregard for the British constitution. As the abolitionist Stephen Lushington thundered in parliament in 1824, \u2018it would not be said, in an English House of Commons, that because men were a shade darker than those who were born in our climate, they were therefore to be deprived of the privileges which the constitution of Great Britain extended equally to her most exalted and her meanest subjects\u2019. He called on the government \u2018to explain to the House the reasons upon which this violent deportation of the petitioners had been resolved upon; and to state why they had been torn away from their homes, without notice of any accusation, and without time to provide for their defence\u2019.[CITATION-59] Not everyone was exercised about the rights of free people of colour, but due process and allegations of gubernatorial despotism had much broader appeal. As Brougham noted pointedly: \u2018This was his charge against the duke of Manchester\u2019, that he had deported two men \u2018after the decision of the court of King\u2019s-bench, and in the teeth of that decision\u2019.[CITATION-60] Lushington swore, ominously, that \u2018would not rest until he had rescued the character of the British nation from the foul disgrace of having participated in an act of such odious oppression as that which the petition detailed\u2019.[CITATION-61] Bathurst and Wilmot Horton were worried. This was an especially anxious time for the Liverpool administration, riven by debates over Catholic emancipation and marked by rumour-mongering about liberal Tories shifting into alliance with moderate Whigs.[CITATION-62] Such were the tensions that Liverpool nearly resigned.[CITATION-63] As we discuss below, the opposition was gleefully seizing on allegations about gubernatorial malfeasance in the Cape of Good Hope just as the Lecesne and Escoffery matter escalated. Both colonial scandals played into popular rhetoric about corrupt officialdom and overseas despotism. Recognising the danger the deportees posed, Bathurst and Wilmot Horton wrote hastily to Manchester for more information, which they tabled before parliament the following year.[CITATION-64] That turned out to be a mistake. Manchester\u2019s \u2018further papers\u2019 only fuelled the fire. They comprised a series of compromising dispatches, complaints and inconsistent depositions, the worst of which came from the government side. Lushington stitched them together into a damning indictment of Lecesne\u2019s and Escoffery\u2019s office-holding accusers, the legislature and the Crown in the colony. To accompanying cheers from the floor, and supported by speeches from his allies, Lushington moved for the appointment of a select committee into the grievances of the exiled men.[CITATION-65] Lushington only withdrew when Canning and Wilmot Horton assured him that \u2018the commissioners in the West Indies had received instructions \u2026 to examine into all the circumstances, and transmit home a report generally upon the transaction\u2019.[CITATION-66] This was stretching the truth somewhat, since the instructions, drawn up only a few days earlier, were still.[CITATION-67] Again, commissions of inquiry were deployed to keep parliament out of empire.Two days after this disastrous parliamentary debate, both Bathurst and Wilmot Horton wrote privately to the governor, hinting strongly how the investigation should go. The matter, urged Bathurst, must be \u2018sifted to the Bottom\u2019, for it had made a \u2018great impression in the House\u2019[CITATION-68] and, Wilmot Horton added, had excited immense \u2018public Interest\u2019 outside it.[CITATION-69] At the same time, they both hinted that the commissioners must conduct a show trial while avoiding any whiff of suspicion that this was their brief. In particular, Wilmot Horton stressed the importance of demonstrating both that Lecesne and Escoffery were not British subjects and that they were engaged in \u2018treasonable conspiracy\u2019. This was so firstly because proving the men to be aliens and conspirators would rid the Colonial Office of the baleful Lushington: if Lecesne and Escoffery were treasonous aliens then \u2018Dr Lushington has incurred a most serious public responsibility the effects of which will be of a most practical and important nature\u2019. Conversely, he warned that if Lushington could \u2018substantiate his case, I need not point out the incalculable injury which will have been done to the character of West Indian Legislatures, already weakened, I am sorry to say, by the conduct of some of them\u2019.[CITATION-70] Bathurst was more explicit, however. He suggested that only a \u2018satisfactory\u2019 report from the commissioners of inquiry might evade an inquiry in the House of Commons, the outcomes of which would certainly not be \u2018favorable\u2019 to Manchester. He therefore stressed the \u2018necessity of collecting the best Evidence\u2019 of Lecesne\u2019s and Escoffery\u2019s alienage and sedition. Proving alienage was \u2018the main point\u2019, though Bathurst and Wilmot Horton agreed that, given their long residence in the island, the men \u2018ought to have had the benefit of the doubt, unless their political conduct was such as not to entitle them to any favor, & rendered this summary way of getting rid of them desirable\u2019.[CITATION-71] Tellingly, Bathurst urged Manchester to present strong evidence against the men, because he anticipated the public-relations disaster for Jamaica if they should be allowed to return:Even if they were good subjects before, they will not be good members of the Jamaica community (at least) after such a triumph over all the authorities of the island \u2026 It is this which makes me very anxious that the case should not be lost for want of due exertion: and in preparing it, allow me to observe that it must be calculated to convince the jealousy of a British public, and not for the meridian of Jamaica.[CITATION-72] In modern parlance, what Bathurst was clearly most concerned about was \u2018optics\u2019.When the commissioners began investigations in early 1826, they did as they were told: Jabez Henry and Henry Coneys came down strongly against Lecesne and Escoffery. On the two matters they were directed to investigate, their report concluded firstly that the men were aliens and secondly that their suspicious behaviour justified removal under Jamaica\u2019s Alien Act. The problem was that, in doing so, they adopted very West Indian evidentiary methods and reasoning. The men\u2019s foreign birth was \u2018proved\u2019 by asserting the unreliability of free black witnesses compared with white deponents. Their sedition was \u2018proved\u2019 more by the opulence of their parties and the fears of honourable white men than by any hard evidence that they had planned to assist a Haitian invasion. So, while the commissioners\u2019 report was written to order, it failed miserably to lance the political boil. Some Colonial Office officials, notably their legal advisor James Stephen (scion of a prominent Abolitionist family), expressed deep scepticism about the commissioners\u2019 conclusions. Bathurst complained privately to Wilmot Horton that Stephen\u2019s assessment was tainted by his private allegiances: \u2018It is the first report in which I think he has shewn the Saint\u2019s foot\u2019.[CITATION-73] Meanwhile Lushington and his humanitarian allies were entirely (and noisily) unconvinced. The matter rumbled on for years, in damning press coverage, a libel suit against a London publisher, and threatened damages litigation against the Duke of Manchester.[CITATION-74] The case was only resolved when an adjudicating lawyer suggested that, as Haiti was under British occupation at the time when the men were likely to have been born, they were British subjects after all.[CITATION-75] The exiles returned to Jamaica triumphantly on the cusp of emancipation. The commissions had failed, and only Liverpool\u2019s stroke and the consequent political turmoil kept the matter out of parliament.[CITATION-76] In the case of the Cape, another key site of investigation that emerged from the Commons debate of 25 July 1822, the Colonial Office\u2019s deployment of commissions to manage scandal while pursuing reform was more successful.[CITATION-77] The Commission of Eastern Inquiry, headed yet again by John Thomas Bigge (this time with William Colebrooke), departed in 1823 to conduct extremely wide-ranging investigations into three of the colonies captured from foreign powers in the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars: the Cape Colony, Mauritius and Ceylon.[CITATION-78] While their instructions covered almost all aspects of colonial governance, Wilmot Horton had told parliament that they would focus on the treatment of bonded labour and the administration of British justice under foreign legal systems. Both would prove to be matters of major difficulty at the Cape.The foundation of the problems at the Cape was not unique. In the Cape, as in most of Britain\u2019s post-1783 colonial acquisitions, Britain retained the system of law and government in force at the time of conquest. Apart from the governor, the military and the most senior colonial officials, the Cape bureaucracy (notably including all ranks of the judiciary) was filled by a generation of Cape Dutch collaborators. The mismatch between British sovereignty and an alien system of governance and law became increasingly untenable as more Britons arrived in the colony (in particular through a wave of state-sponsored migration from 1820). New settlers complained loudly of being subject to an antiquated bureaucracy that was hostile both to their entrepreneurial ambitions and to their sense of traditional liberties and that was moreover managed by foreigners in a language they could not understand. The arrival of the Commission of Eastern Inquiry, mandated by the Crown to investigate ways to modernise and Anglicise the Cape, caused these simmering tensions to boil over. The commission was overwhelmed with complaints, some of which spilled into parliament. This, as Wilmot Horton argued in a heated debate with Joseph Hume in 1826, was not what the commissions were designed to do: \u2018It was certainly not the intention of government\u2019, he argued, \u2018indeed it would have been highly absurd in them\u2014to unfurl a standard in a new colony for all the disaffected to rally round. They never intended to set up a mart for grievances\u2019.[CITATION-79] Opposition members were quick to transform the most sensational Cape complaints into attacks on Liverpool\u2019s ministry.[CITATION-80] Furthermore, if the problems presented by the Cape were structural, they were also exacerbated by the character and political connections of a governor who came to personify them in the minds of critics. Lord Charles Somerset was an obvious target for Whigs and Radicals in both colony and metropole, for he exemplified so much of what they wished to see swept away in their attack on \u2018Old Corruption\u2019. He would also become an increasing liability for a government seeking to demonstrate its financial and administrative probity.[CITATION-81] Somerset was comfortably rooted in the heart of the most conservative faction of the Tory party. His father was the fifth duke of Beaufort; as such, he came from a family of immense wealth and political influence, \u2018an aristocracy within an aristocracy\u2019.[CITATION-82] It was to Somerset that Hume referred in the House when he railed against the fact that \u2018Vast sums were expended to keep pampered minions in power, over whose conduct no salutary check was exercised\u2019.[CITATION-83] Arriving at the Cape in 1814, Somerset found a context surely much to his liking, and he formed a close and amicable relationship with the incumbent Cape Dutch oligarchy. In a colony run almost entirely by the rules of the old Dutch regime, there were no inconvenient modern innovations such as checks on executive power or freedom of the press. The Cape also had a well-established tradition of linking administration with personal advantage.Lacking even an advisory council until 1825, Somerset was inclined by both his background and his politics to treat the Cape rather as he might an outlying demesne of the Beaufort estate. He had a passion for the turf and spent government money lavishly on personal projects. He gave out and expected favours (several of which involved dubious horse deals) in return for guaranteeing the outcome of land grant requests and legal disputes. He was intolerant of publicly voiced opposition and inclined to meddle (as was legal under the Dutch system he had inherited) in judicial processes. He arrested local whistleblowers when they sought to expose customs officials\u2019 corruption in the treatment of liberated Africans. Most dangerously for the reputation of the Liverpool administration, in 1824 Somerset forcibly closed down a nascent independent press in Cape Town and deported the most vocal of his British settler critics on the basis of dubiously applied Dutch laws of defamation.[CITATION-84] In short, Somerset was perfect fodder for opposition parliamentarians: he was corrupt (by their reckoning), unaccountable and enabled by the vagaries of foreign colonial law\u2014the embodiment of the problems of Crown Colonial government. As pressure for his recall and impeachment grew, Bathurst turned, again, to the commissions for aid. In their sojourn in the Cape, the Secretary of State hoped the commissioners might provide an \u2018obvious answer\u2019 to attacks on Somerset\u2019s actions and salary in the \u2018next [parliamentary] session\u2019.[CITATION-85] The commissioners\u2019 role in massaging the wrath of parliament was more complex and interesting than the intrigues in Jamaica. Not only did the commissioners themselves play an active role in dampening colonial controversy, but Cape scandals directly threatened the conservative alliance at the heart of the Liverpool regime. Once it became clear that the commissioners would be delayed at the Cape for a considerable period, further instructions and guidance began to flow out from London, directing them to investigate particular complaints against Somerset and his officials.[CITATION-86] The commissioners also penned reports to meet the political needs of government. When they investigated individual complaints, whether on instruction or otherwise, they played down individual wrongdoing, instead blaming government scandals on systemic flaws in the Dutch legal and administrative regime.[CITATION-87] In these documents, malfeasance dissolved into recommendations for reform. The first Cape report tabled in parliament, and the longest at over 200 pages, was emblematic of this dual purpose. It addressed the legal troubles of a small-time farmer in the frontier district of Albany called Bishop Burnett.Burnett\u2019s case would have sunk into obscurity had it not produced six escalating lawsuits (all conducted in Dutch) and ended with Burnett being sentenced to banishment for doing nothing more than sending a harshly worded memorial to Somerset. The apparent triviality of the Burnett case, which dominated parliamentary debate on the Cape through 1825 and 1826 and was discussed widely in the British press, underscores the political damage that could be done by a disgruntled settler mobilising opposition political forces at home.[CITATION-88] In their report, the commissioners deflected the question of responsibility for Burnett\u2019s objectionable deportation into a critique of the colony\u2019s Dutch legal system.[CITATION-89] Wilmot Horton anticipated this move even before receiving the commissioners\u2019 report. It was \u2018unfair\u2019, he claimed in June 1825, countering Brougham\u2019s determined attacks, \u2018not to distinguish \u2026 between the acts of the governor and the defects of the Dutch law\u2019.[CITATION-90] The commissioners also demonstrated their advantage over parliamentary select committees by alerting the ministry to problems before they arose. This was particularly important in the Cape where proconsular excesses had become a political liability. Thus in 1824 Bigge and Colebrooke wrote privately to Bathurst with \u2018brief & early notice\u2019 of attacks on Somerset that \u2018we are apprehensive \u2026 may become the subject of public observation in England, before we shall be able to notice the connexion in which they stand with some of the most important objects of our public inquiry\u2019.[CITATION-91] Three days later they passed on a warning of rumours that one of Somerset\u2019s victims was about to send a dangerous set of documents for MP Henry Grey Bennet (the member who had mobilised colonial correspondence to intrude into the management of New South Wales) to put before the House.[CITATION-92] The commissioners also kept one eye on the English newspapers and were ready to act pre-emptively to deflect scandals by transmitting counter-evidence via private and confidential channels to Bathurst when required.[CITATION-93] The Cape controversies cast new light on the slow unravelling of the Liverpool alliance. They were ill-timed for the ministry, and the administration of empire hung in the balance.[CITATION-94] Historians of domestic politics have emphasised the \u2018delicate state\u2019 in which the Tories found themselves at this time, with the Catholic question putting increasing pressure on the loose ties that bound the party together.[CITATION-95] As noted, Liverpool was on the point of resigning in 1825 and his old comrade Bathurst was instrumental in persuading him to stay in office. As Bathurst complained in a devastatingly candid private letter to the Cape governor in October 1824, Somerset had meddled with things likely to stir up \u2018English feeling\u2019\u2014the freedom of the press and expulsion without trial. These would \u2018come for Parliamentary discussion at a moment peculiarly inauspicious\u2019, especially as the \u2018question has been stirr\u2019d in India\u2019.[CITATION-96] As with his correspondence with Manchester about Lecesne and Escoffery, Bathurst acknowledged that the view from the metropole would differ from that of the colonies. \u2018What you have done [in shutting down the press and forcibly exiling well-connected British critics on dubious legal grounds] appears, probably at the Cape like no more than what might be expected from such provocations. Unfortunately here, these Questions will not be so judged. They will appear harsh and arbitrary\u2019. Somerset\u2019s intemperate use of his authority would probably raise concern over \u2018the powers vested in the Governors of the ceded Possessions\u2019.[CITATION-97] The category of British possessions that would become known as Crown Colonies was still in constitutional flux in the 1820s. Their status was repeatedly questioned by Hume, for example, in debates over approving parliamentary expenditure.[CITATION-98] Without pre-emptive action, Bathurst argued to Somerset, such critiques could lead to proconsular powers \u2018being curtailed in a manner very prejudicial to their [the Crown Colonies\u2019] real interests\u2019.[CITATION-99] It was with the precise intent of putting a more acceptable face on proconsular power that Bathurst announced in the same letter that he would be providing Somerset with an advisory council. Bathurst nevertheless pledged \u2018that as you will be attacked upon party principles, you are entitled to party support\u2019.[CITATION-100] Confidential letters between Robert Wilmot Horton and Lord Granville Somerset (the governor\u2019s nephew, junior Treasury lord and MP for Monmouthshire) also highlight the problem that the fallout from the Cape commission raised for both the Colonial Office and the government in a tense domestic political situation.[CITATION-101] In a series of private letters and personal meetings they plotted out the course of damage control between 1824 and 1825, as the Cape prompted a \u2018great brawling\u2019 in parliament and in the British press, inspired by the \u2018holy fervour of the Saints\u2019, the Whigs and the Radicals.[CITATION-102] This furore sat ill with the Beaufort clan. A nervous Wilmot Horton found himself squirming under accusations that his dealings with the Cape exposed a \u2018liberal\u2019 streak, which he and Granville Somerset agreed was a very bad thing indeed.[CITATION-103] Granville Somerset articulated the stakes with brutal clarity. \u2018To criminate an Aristocratist Governor when in office\u2019, he warned, \u2018is most agreeable to Hume & Co, but to continue that attack when he is loaded by the disapprobation of his Government would not be either unprofitable or unpleasant to those Gentlemen\u2019. He recommended aggressive evasive action. The ministry would prevail \u2018if the Government moot the Question [of the Cape] boldly blinking thru parts that are not tenable by want of Information & relying upon them wherein there is no difficulty\u2019.[CITATION-104] The sluggish commissions were of obvious value in this project of obfuscation and delay. They were mobilised routinely by Wilmot Horton, who countered criticisms of lack of progress or failure to deal with corruption by claiming the need for further evidence and investigation on the ground before any action could be taken.[CITATION-105] The manner in which the ministry deployed colonial royal commissions with one eye on domestic political agendas did not escape the attention of the wider public.was scathing about the entire commission system. The mere existence of a commission, argued the paper in June 1827, could be touted by the Colonial Office as sufficient proof of the government\u2019s fair dealing:[The] bulk of the report will be taken for evidence of the industry with which the inquiries were made; the suppressions, however large, will be unnoticed; and if a word be breathed about any skill which may have been exerted in preferring one class of evidence, or excluding another, so as to soften the general complexion of facts \u2026 there is nothing half so easy as for a Right Honourable Secretary to put on big looks of official gravity, and of wounded virtue\u2014to \u2018reject with scorn\u2019 the most remote suspicion that might bear upon the perfect impartiality of the Commissioners\u2014to \u2018deprecate the harsh prejudices\u2019 which go forth against Colonial Governors.[CITATION-106] Asrecognised, these delaying tactics protected men like Somerset, and neutralised the pressure that colonial politics exerted on the Liverpool administration, until the hand of fate unexpectedly intervened.On 17 February 1827 Liverpool suffered a stroke from which he did not recover. George Canning was chosen by the king to succeed him. The result was a mass exodus of the more conservative Tories, including both Bathurst and Somerset, from office. Faced with the loss of five members of his prospective cabinet, as well as scores of less senior politicians, Canning was forced to form a government (which proved short-lived) with moderates and Whigs. The question of Somerset\u2019s fate, overshadowed by these greater matters, fizzled out. Issues to do with the Cape were by no means resolved, but the Cape governor himself all but vanished from the pages of Hansard. The Cape controversy tarnished the reputation of the commission, however. Their alleged attempt to protect Somerset, combined with frequent and justified complaints about their cost and delays, made the Eastern Inquiry a focus of parliamentary frustration, and, increasingly, ridicule. The kaleidoscope of ministries that followed Liverpool at once relied on returned commissioners for information into the 1830s while staving off calls from Treasury and parliament for their speedy dismissal.[CITATION-107] To scholars of empire, it seems unfathomable that British historians can still talk about constitutional change in Britain as if it were not involved in the governance of millions of souls across the seas. In some respects, however, this myopia is reasonable. Parliamentarians argued much more about the Corn Laws or Catholic emancipation than they did about Crown rule or even slavery in the empire. In any case, as has been recently pointed out, the narrow gaze of scholars working on the intricate pathways of politics in Britain is reciprocated.[CITATION-108] Despite more than a decade passing since the pioneering work of Zo\u00eb Laidlaw and Alan Lester, many scholars of empire still ignore the fact that the domestic political landscape had an impact on their concerns.[CITATION-109] To employ Tony Ballantyne\u2019s metaphor, they write about webs of empire without paying due attention to the spider at its centre.[CITATION-110] Yet, if empire was peripheral to many in parliament, its fate was still bound intimately into the seething mess of shifting alliances, enmities and ideologies that divided parliament. While much ink has been spilled over the degree to which ordinary Britons cared about empire, it is more illuminating to examine how imperial concerns were used strategically to further political agendas closer to home.[CITATION-111] Certainly for contemporary politicians, especially those in the Colonial Office, this nexus was never in question. Lacking the benefits of hindsight, they simply assumed that imperial questions had traction in domestic politics and acted accordingly. For those in opposition, there were attractions in targeting imperial policy, and in presenting the colonial department as \u2018an expensive incubus\u2019.[CITATION-112] Following the wending path of imperial controversy in parliament in the moment of inquiry, the question of reform under the Liverpool administration looks much more like tactics than ideology. Members of the Colonial Office, particularly the Secretary of State and his under-secretaries, were explicit in the ways they used the constitutional advantages of royal commissions to evade an unpredictable and often hostile parliamentary system. They were demonstrably sensitive to the force of public opinion, whatever their views on its legitimacy. Tracking declared strategy not only makes issues of motivation easier to pin down, it also complicates the lines historians have drawn around Tory ideology in the contentious 1820s.In the end, these machinations are not the whole story of imperial reform. Inquiries were convened and declared to do more than forestall parliamentary interference. While their reports might have protected the ministry from the excesses of local officials, as they did consistently at the Cape, it is too simplistic to call them \u2018cover-ups\u2019, as critics did at the time. They combined reform with political management. The inquiry into New South Wales answered growing controversy, but also real government concerns about the efficacy of the colony in meeting the very Tory projects of law and order and counter-revolution. Wholesale inquiry into empire was initiated after a series of speeches by disgruntled MPs, but its announcement in a single day underscores that the process was planned and stage-managed by the ministry. Inquiry answered the deeper problem of knitting recently conquered colonies into the empire by determining how and under what law they should be governed, where the line of freedom and bondage should be drawn, and who could claim the responsibilities and rights of British subjecthood. So, when commissioners were directed to inquire into the scandals of free black subjecthood and Somerset\u2019s aristocratic tyrannies, they were already ensconced in the larger project of remaking empire. In all three zones of inquiry, managing parliamentary politics overlaid a larger project to protect Crown control of new colonies and to effect meaningful, if conservative, legal reform. So it is that empire illuminates the puzzle of Tory reform, revealing its existential need to keep parliament onside, and its commitment both to autocratic governance and to gubernatorial and judicial accountability."

    "title": "Working-Class Women and the Buying and Selling of Stolen Goods in Urban Communities in the North West of England and Belfast, 1918\u20131960*",
    "author": "Charlotte Wildman",
    "date": "20 May 2023",
    "text": "The buying and selling of stolen goods by working-class women was a relatively widespread and accepted practice in some inner urban communities in the North West of England and in Belfast between 1918 and 1960. It relied on the training and engagement of children and the co-operation and compliance of neighbours, and was facilitated by the spatial dynamics within inner urban terraced homes. This article analyses local court records, memoirs and contemporary social surveys to demonstrate that, after 1918, the buying and selling of stolen goods by working-class women did not just play a part in people\u2019s economic lives. It argues that, even outside times of poverty, in certain neighbourhoods the practice reinforced strong community bonds and allowed some women to contest the inequalities they experienced by consolidating their position within strong supportive networks against a society that afforded them little formal power. Together, these sources present a quotidian culture of minor criminality that challenges received views of working-class cultures of domesticity, family life and \u2018respectability\u2019, suggesting that trading in stolen goods could afford women offenders status and respect within their neighbourhoods. The article highlights the enduring practice of home-based buying and selling of stolen goods across the period, particularly in areas untouched by housing clearance and redevelopment. Despite significant developments in the state provision of welfare and greater scrutiny of working-class families, the offence endured as a way to bolster close-knit community bonds in protest against the harsh living conditions and persistent inequities many still experienced.As day broke on 30 July 1918, Manchester Police Inspector James Baron reported seeing a middle-aged woman named Edith Jenkins leave her home, a terraced house on Rochdale Road to the north of the city centre (). Before returning inside, Edith \u2018looked in the direction of town. She did this several times\u2019. Shortly afterwards, Baron observed John Murphy, a known thief, and Edith\u2019s 15-year-old son, Matthew, arrive on a horse and cart carrying a large, covered package. Finding Edith in her kitchen, Baron noted she \u2018suddenly jumped up and ran out of the kitchen and into the scullery, through the yard and into the street\u2019. Once caught, Edith explained she ran away because \u2018I wanted to save my son\u2019. Police subsequently located five padlocks and twenty-five keys, six of which were blank, and a pommel vice and file in the living room of Edith\u2019s home. Investigations revealed that John Murphy, assisted by Matthew and another of Edith\u2019s sons, had undertaken several large warehouse thefts in Manchester and stolen cloth worth over a thousand pounds, which Edith then sold to women who lived nearby. Edith said little to the police, except to repeat, \u2018I want to save my son\u2019.[CITATION-1] Rochdale Road, pictured in 1958. Edith Jenkins occupied two adjacent terraces with her large family, where she undertook significant receiving of stolen goods.: Manchester Libraries, Information and Archives.Using her sons to thieve, storing stolen goods at home and selling them to neighbours made Edith typical of working-class women\u2019s participation in the buying and selling of stolen goods in some urban neighbourhoods in the North West of England and Belfast between 1918 and 1960. Not without risks of violence and retribution, the relatively widespread illegal practice relied on the training and engagement of children as well as the co-operation and compliance of neighbours. It was facilitated by the spatial dynamics within inner urban terraced homes and their external alleyways and passages. Engaging in the buying and selling of stolen goods was one of several methods of coping with the poverty many families in these areas experienced after 1918, despite an overall increase in living standards and a gradual rise in state provision of welfare.[CITATION-2] There is a significant body of literature charting the use of tactics such as pawning possessions and borrowing from neighbours in times of hardship, which tends to reinforce an image of the stoic and self-sacrificial working-class mother who prioritised familial domesticity.[CITATION-3] In contrast, scholarship on women dealers in stolen goods in the nineteenth century highlights offenders\u2019 associations with prostitution. Andrew Davies argues that in press coverage of the female figurehead of a notorious criminal gang, Liz D\u2019Arcy, known for selling illicit goods and running a house of ill-repute, \u2018violence and vice were closely meshed\u2019.[CITATION-4] This article draws on local court records, memoirs and contemporary social surveys to demonstrate that, after 1918, dealing with stolen goods might be associated with violence, but not vice. By demonstrating that it was a fairly acceptable practice within some urban working-class communities, even outside times of poverty, this article presents a rethinking of the role of crime and offending in these neighbourhoods. It suggests that participation in the buying and selling of stolen goods was not necessarily seen as deviant, but as a method to challenge inequalities and protest against unpopular state intervention and surveillance. Nor was it seen as necessarily harmful to cultures of domesticity or family life: the inclusion and training of children in the activity was considered as teaching them crucial survival strategies in times of hardship and poverty, essential because of the widespread understanding that local and national governments were uncaring. In using a regional perspective on the history of crime, this article illuminates how marginalised figures, especially working-class women and their children, offended not just out of economic need but as a form of protest that cemented their belonging to close-knit, at times restrictive, communities in ways that had both positive and negative consequences.The buying and selling of stolen goods by working-class women in Manchester, Liverpool, Birkenhead, Salford and Belfast provided a means to \u2018get one over\u2019 the exploitative state. As Madeline Kerr\u2019s 1958 sociological survey of Liverpool observed, for such working-class urban communities, \u2018the world is divided into the individual\u2019s own group, and the rest. The individual is loyal to members of his own group, but the rest of the world is fair game\u2019.[CITATION-5] Pat Ayers, who conducted interviews in the 1980s with those who lived in the Liverpool dock area in the early to mid-twentieth century, highlighted discrepancies between inhabitants\u2019 attitudes to certain crimes and that of the police or the state: \u2018In particular, theft, was subject to very different moral perspectives. Men and women worked very hard in appalling conditions for very low wages. They weren\u2019t valued or respected by their employers and so owed nothing in return. They and their neighbours lived in poverty, barely meeting their subsistence needs\u2014this was immoral\u2019.[CITATION-6] The commonplace and largely accepted practice of dealing in illicit goods by working-class women in some urban communities, and perhaps particularly in Liverpool, was a way to challenge the inequities they, their families and neighbours experienced.This perspective suggests that we may see working-class women\u2019s engagement in property offences as a form of active citizenship that was part of a longer tradition of protests against poor living conditions, such as rent strikes.[CITATION-7] Dealing with stolen goods was a method of remonstrating against uncaring and unfair employers and the state while also giving access to goods cheaply. In some urban neighbourhoods these were considered as legitimate reasons to offend. At the same time, such offences risked women\u2019s exposure to violent men and the police, and often contributed to their reliance and dependence on their neighbours. By demonstrating that small-scale non-violent offending contributed to everyday life in contradictory ways, including the forging of close bonds and reinforcing community and familial ties that may have been difficult to escape, we can see that the culture of buying and selling stolen goods helped to shape relations between citizen and state, including by attracting police scrutiny and unwelcome intervention. The article thus shows the value of exploring class-based and regionally defined variations in understandings of deviance in twentieth-century Britain in greater depth as a means to understand more comprehensively how the state and citizen clashed over the home and family life, with particularly negative implications for vulnerable women and children.Drawing attention to working-class women\u2019s use of their homes and families for offences contributes to emerging historical scholarship on crime and domesticity which highlights perceptions of crime as an aberration from the sanctity of the home in nineteenth and twentieth-century Britain.[CITATION-8] Amy Bell argues that crime scene photography amplified the perceived incongruity between domestic space and criminal activity and \u2018invested the home and the human face and form with emotional significance, but in mirror image to signify loss and disruption\u2019.[CITATION-9] Bringing this rich scholarship\u2014which demonstrates how homes were invested with meanings of safety and familial sociability\u2014into conversation with research on domestic violence, abuse and illicit sexuality highlights the fluidity and contradictions of working-class domestic space.[CITATION-10] As Alison Blunt and Robyn Dowling suggest, the home is a \u2018spatial imaginary\u2019 and \u2018a complex and multi-layered geographical concept\u2019.[CITATION-11] Using their homes to display, hide and sell purloined goods reflected the value women placed on their ability to restrict who entered their houses. However, while their homes could be an asset to this kind of criminal enterprise, they could also be a liability. The presence and movement of stolen goods through homes made offenders more vulnerable, both to exposure to the police and to the risk of violence and extortion from male accomplices.The use of domestic space for offending by working-class women reflected their autonomy as the \u2018boss\u2019 within the home, particularly in comparison to the danger and surveillance that inhibited their ability to move freely within urban space.[CITATION-12] Women\u2019s involvement in the trade in illicit clothing and food and their reliance on children, friends and neighbours, supports scholarship that explains women\u2019s thefts as what Shani d\u2019Cruze and Louise Jackson conceive of as their \u2018expertise, knowledge and household role\u2019.[CITATION-13] This article contributes to new approaches to the history of gender and crime advanced by Sanne Muurling, Marion Pluskota and Manon van der Heijden, who argue that, rather than focusing on gendered differences in criminality, we should address \u2018how specific (cultural and socio-economic) contexts offered women \u201cagency\u201d to lead independent lives\u2019.[CITATION-14] However, the research presented here is less a history of crime than an analysis of the ways in which women\u2019s participation in the buying, hiding and selling of stolen goods was an everyday practice within some urban communities. Its endurance across the period from 1918 to 1960 supports Mark Roodhouse\u2019s argument inthat, during the Second World War and its aftermath, working-class neighbourhoods \u2018adapted longstanding survival strategies to cope with the new problems that austerity threw up\u2019.[CITATION-15] Nonetheless, although receiving took place outside of times of acute hardship, the training of children was most prominent in the 1920s due to the severe problems of poverty and limited welfare provision. It became less common by the 1930s, probably because of the impact of greater state intervention in working-class family life, such as the increased attention paid by school attendance officers and probation workers to child welfare.[CITATION-16] In the 1920s and 1930s it was not uncommon for some women to command large-scale offences, but by the 1940s and 1950s there was a greater tendency for women to engage in smaller andcrimes, particularly as a result of the impact rationing and price control had on the market for stolen goods.The scale of women\u2019s involvement with purloined goods is uncovered here through a detailed reading of qualitative sources taken from hitherto unused pre-trial depositions and statements contained in the archives of Quarter Sessions courts between 1918 and 1960. Presided over by a justice of the peace or a recorder, there were sixty-six courts of Quarter Sessions in England and Wales and seven in Northern Ireland. They dealt with a range of judicial matters, particularly property offences and fraud but also some bastardy cases and sexual offences.[CITATION-17] In 1928, the Liverpool Sessions heard a total of ninety-two cases and governed a population of 805,000, while the Manchester Sessions heard ninety-seven cases and had a population of 730,000.[CITATION-18] Quarter Sessions were abolished in 1972, and their rich archives give a revealing account of the lives of those who remain marginalised from history, although they do vary in terms of detail offered. Depositions have usually survived in isolation from the wider court papers and do not include court transcripts, so we cannot know the response to these statements in court. They often lack follow-up information, including the outcome of the case, although some trials were covered in the local press. The application of the law tended to focus on women selling goods, rather than those buying them, and so the evidence disproportionately focuses on the purveyors of illicit goods, rather than their customers. Cases of stolen goods may also have been heard in the Petty Sessions Courts, which dealt with very minor and small-scale offences, but their records are scant in detail and may not necessarily describe the offence beyond the prisoner\u2019s name and punishment.This research analysed cases relating to the receiving of stolen goods in the records for Belfast, Bolton, Chester, Liverpool, Birkenhead, Manchester and Salford, to explore the relationship between theft and local economies. They show that the buying and selling of stolen goods was relatively common in some port towns and cities, such as Belfast and Birkenhead, and commercial centres, such as Salford and Manchester, which also benefited from significant port traffic alongside large warehouses and comprehensive railway networks. These trends were noted in the, which identified the high prevalence of receiving stolen goods in Liverpool in 1931, the challenges of policing the dock area effectively and the difficulty of infiltrating long-standing crime networks.[CITATION-19] However, the practice was not necessarily widespread in all ports: it seemed to be especially common in the North West of England. For instance, in 1924, fifty-five of 1,013 indictable offences recorded in Birkenhead Police District, with a population of 161,000, related to dealing in stolen goods. This compared to just twenty-five of 1,094 offences noted in the southern port town of Southampton, which had a population of 656,000 (). This discrepancy may be explained by the nature of the local economies (Merseyside\u2019s port trade suffered more considerably than Southampton\u2019s during the inter-war economic depression), which contributed to the preponderance of buying and selling of stolen goods in Belfast, Liverpool, Birkenhead, Manchester and Salford.Number of handling stolen goods offences across a sample of police districts compared to total number of indictable offences. Cases of simple larceny in 1924 are shown in brackets as the most common offence recorded by each district.Home Office,(London, 1924\u20131938).Number of handling stolen goods offences across a sample of police districts compared to total number of indictable offences. Cases of simple larceny in 1924 are shown in brackets as the most common offence recorded by each district.Home Office,(London, 1924\u20131938).Archives of the Quarter Sessions also vary significantly in scope due to differing retention policies and, in some cases, due to the damage inflicted during the Second World War and beyond. In Belfast, Manchester, Salford, Bolton, and Birkenhead, surviving records are relatively comprehensive. In Liverpool, only the less detailed indictment files have survived and are supplemented in this research by arrest registers (which are catalogued as relating to the Magistrates\u2019 Court but which included prisoners sent to the Quarter Sessions for more serious crimes). In Chester, the sessions files for most years are available, but without the inclusion of depositions. Where detailed records have survived, they provide a rare opportunity to hear testimony from the working classes that is not retrospective, testimony which supports Jon Lawrence\u2019s claim that \u2018everyday language can be used to recover the \u201cstructures of feeling\u201d of ordinary people\u2019.[CITATION-20] Although the judicial and police systems manifest a clear power imbalance against working-class women, such women could also disrupt this process.[CITATION-21] Depositions are therefore analysed here as a form of personal testimony or\u2014using Carolyn Steedman\u2019s phrase\u2014as an enforced narrative, \u2018fashioned according to requirement\u2019.[CITATION-22] Offenders infused their accounts with a range of defensive strategies designed to exonerate themselves. The testimonies thus expose women\u2019s ability to draw on their domestic authority, particularly their power over children, relationships with other women, and the manipulation of widespread concerns about violence at the hands of men. Court records are assessed here in conjunction with accounts from contemporary observers, including an analysis of fifty working-class memoirs and several sociological surveys. Embracing their \u2018silences, absences and contradictions\u2019, memoirs undermine idealised images of working-class family life and allow historians to draw attention to the tensions and chaotic features of domesticity.[CITATION-23] Together, these sources present a quotidian culture of minor criminality that challenges received views of working-class cultures of domesticity, family life and \u2018respectability\u2019, suggesting that participation in minor theft in these towns and cities consolidated community bonds and protested the persistently tough living conditions and inequalities their inhabitants endured. Considering women\u2019s participation in everyday cultures of criminality as a form of protest against the state helps reconfigure how we analyse the role of offending in working-class neighbourhoods, as these crimes were often tolerated, and perhaps even encouraged, because they not only harmed the state and business owners but also sought to improve the lives of the poor.Edith Jenkins\u2019s crimes probably only came to light because she facilitated the movement of such a large quantity of stolen goods. The buying and selling of stolen goods\u2014then described in law as \u2018receiving\u2019 and now known as \u2018handling\u2019\u2014was generally tolerated within certain working-class neighbourhoods in cities in the North West and Belfast. This was despite the 1916 Larceny Act stipulating that anyone found to have bought or sold \u2018any property knowing the same to have been stolen or obtained in any way whatsoever under circumstances which amount to felony or misdemeanour, shall be guilty of an offence of the like degree\u2019. Offences carried a maximum prison sentence of fourteen years but, as we shall see, even the toughest punishments meted out to female offenders never reached these kinds of terms.[CITATION-24] Asillustrates, larceny was the most common offence police dealt with and the number of stolen goods cases was relatively small. In Liverpool, there were ninety cases of stolen goods out of 10,399 offences in 1924, and 131 out of 13,651 in 1932. Manchester saw forty cases of stolen goods out of 2,588 offences in 1924 and eighty out of 3,333 in 1932. However, large amounts of the buying and selling of stolen goods took place without detection and it is impossible to know the full extent of receiving. Contemporary police manuals noted the challenges of securing convictions, which required proof that offenders had committed larceny or fraud alongside possession of the item, knowing it was stolen.[CITATION-25] Home Office statistics demonstrate a notable rise in cases of receiving in England and Wales (), from 3,433 in 1938 to a peak of 10,132 in 1945 and falling slightly to 9,716 in 1951 and 10,002 in 1958. The number of women convicted of dealing in stolen goods also rose but remained relatively small.shows that the number of offenders committed on charges of receiving at Quarter Sessions and Assizes in England and Wales increased from thirty-six women and 340 men in 1919, to forty-three women and 389 men in 1932, rising to 113 women and 937 men in 1958. Yet the proportion of women offenders in England\u2014roughly 10 per cent\u2014remained fairly consistent across the period, suggesting that receiving occupied a comparably stable role in women\u2019s criminality across a significant period of social and economic change. Women\u2019s participation was probably far more widespread than these figures suggest, as the police usually only prosecuted women involved in the selling of goods and tended to use their customers as witnesses, albeit perhaps under the threat of prosecution. In addition, the police often exonerated, lightly fined or bound over many women offenders as it was difficult to prove they knew the goods had been stolen.[CITATION-26] Some offenders benefited from police corruption, which was not uncommon, particularly in Liverpool where the numbers of women charged with receiving stood at just five in 1929 and ten in 1932.[CITATION-27] There, offenders exploited the city\u2019s notorious dock crime and a widespread practice of pilfering, in which the police were often complicit.[CITATION-28] Suspects were especially difficult to catch because the Port Police, who were independent from the local constabulary, did not have the power to search suspects.Cases of receiving of stolen goods in England and Wales.Home Office,(London, 1959), p. vii.Cases of receiving of stolen goods in England and Wales.Home Office,(London, 1959), p. vii.Number of offenders committed on charges of receiving at Quarter Sessions and Assizes in England and Wales.Source: Home Office,,(London, 1955), p. viii; and Home Office,,, p. vii.Number of offenders committed on charges of receiving at Quarter Sessions and Assizes in England and Wales.Source: Home Office,,(London, 1955), p. viii; and Home Office,,, p. vii.Women receivers were certainly familiar figures to the police in the North West of England. In 1931, thereported the frequency with which women in Liverpool used roles in paid employment on the docks to obtain illicit goods: \u2018In one instance a garrulous old cleaner was leaving, and, on being challenged by a constable, remarked as she touched her head with her forefinger, \u201cIt\u2019s up here you want it\u201d. The constable, concluding this might be so, asked her to remove her hat, under which was concealed four small tins of sardines\u2019.[CITATION-29] This light-hearted anecdote and emphasis on the small-scale nature of the crime\u2014we are told that the tins of sardines are small, as opposed to large catering or industrial sized tins\u2014suggests that the police did not necessarily take women\u2019s receiving seriously. Ayers\u2019s Liverpool study also includes an anecdote about a woman who worked at the docks canteen after her husband was injured at work: \u2018She used to say to him\u2014the policeman\u2014\u201cI\u2019m taking soup home, because you know my husband\u2019s sick.\u201d And tins of ham and things like that and \u2026 they\u2019d wrap the sheets round them (laughs)\u2019.[CITATION-30] The light-hearted retelling of this story, which is strikingly similar to the Liverpool anecdote featured in the, indicates that the state struggled to suppress the handling of stolen goods in some urban areas because, like illegal gambling, it was widely tolerated by police and civilians.[CITATION-31] The humorous image of women receivers was also not dissimilar to portrayals of middle-aged working-class shoplifters that emphasised their comedic and slapstick image as offenders.[CITATION-32] This portrayal contrasted with that of other female offenders, such as women burglars, who, Eloise Moss argues, were depicted by commentators as rarities, despite making up 4 per cent of burglary cases nationally and a quarter of those in London, in the period 1860\u20131938, because \u2018women burglars were thought to have betrayed their nature by undermining the sanctity of \u201chome\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-33] As most female receivers tended to be older married women with children who dealt with illicit food and clothing within their own homes, the offence was probably not seen as an aberration from their roles and responsibilities in the same way that burglary was.Prior to 1918, most offenders dealing in stolen goods lived in lodging houses in city centres.[CITATION-34] This pattern reflected an ambiguous connection between \u2018deviant\u2019 and \u2018normal\u2019 life that existed in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century economy of makeshifts.[CITATION-35] By the early to middle decades of the twentieth century, a mix of urban poverty and women\u2019s domestic roles coexisted with a relatively secure period of \u2018face-to-face\u2019 community where people often occupied the same houses for a number of years. Lawrence suggests this stable culture of domesticity was \u2018a new and fleeting phenomenon with no parallel either before or since\u2019.[CITATION-36] Lawrence\u2019s claim is supported in memoirs such as that of Joseph Armitage, whose family lived in a terraced house in Hunslet, an inner-city area of Leeds, for twenty-two years until 1939, despite describing it \u2018as a real slum, without any relieving feature at all\u2019.[CITATION-37] Consequently, cases of buying and selling stolen goods almost entirely took place in modest-sized terraced houses in inner urban, working-class areas, such as Manchester\u2019s Chorlton-on-Medlock or Belfast\u2019s Falls Road.[CITATION-38] These particular historical factors afforded women offenders the opportunity to use the close proximity of female neighbours and friends to buy, sell and hide stolen goods, mirroring established traditions of borrowing, visiting and helping others within their communities.[CITATION-39] These inner urban areas were often home to Catholic migrant communities who appear regularly in the Quarter Sessions, but this may have been a product of discriminatory police practices rather than higher levels of criminality. Kerr\u2019s sociological study did focus on a Liverpool Irish-Catholic \u2018slum\u2019 area and reported a relaxed attitude towards property crime and the \u2018general feeling seems to be that it is a pity to be found out\u2019.[CITATION-40] Some women offenders, especially in Manchester and Salford, resorted to antisemitic language to exonerate themselves. In one of the few statements she made to the police, Edith Jenkins claimed that she bought the stolen goods at the local market \u2018from an old Jew \u2026 I don\u2019t know his name or where he lives, only he has whiskers\u2019.[CITATION-41] The use of this racialised language as a defensive strategy shows that working-class women recognised those defined as outsiders; the use of fictional Jewish men as scapegoats allowed them to avoid pointing their finger at one of their own.As the hostility towards those defined as \u2018outsiders\u2019 suggests, the buying and selling of stolen goods reinforced tightly knit bonds within communities in opposition to the police and the victims of theft, usually businesses, shops and shipping, railway and utilities companies. The relationship between the police (who were usually working-class themselves) and the urban communities they patrolled could be complex and, as the police historian Joanne Klein emphasises, encounters were characterised as much by hostility as civility.[CITATION-42] Certainly, memoirs depicting the post-First World War period stress that the police were seen as a threatening presence in working-class neighbourhoods: Ellen Glencross, born in Salford in 1914, recalled the terror her mother experienced when, taking Ellen and her siblings to her own mother\u2019s house before work, a policeman stopped her to ask why they were out so early. Ellen\u2019s mother was petrified, she recalled, and \u2018by the time we reached my grandmother\u2019s she was in tears, and at first my grandmother thought she had been molested\u2019.[CITATION-43] Tensions with the police emerge in memoirs throughout the period, such as Jack Maddox\u2019s account of 1940s and 1950s Liverpool, which emphasises that \u2018people were unwilling to inform on others, even if they disapproved of their actions. Authority was regarded as harsh and unsympathetic and the natural enemy of the people\u2019.[CITATION-44] This concern was part of a wider suspicion of any representative of the local state who had the authority to pry into the homes and lives of working-class families, including school attendance officers and Public Assistance inspectors.[CITATION-45] The activist and playwright George Garrett recalled his experience of unemployment in the 1920s and noted that \u2018I seldom allowed a parish visitor over the doorstep. Mywas still my castle despite its poverty\u2019.[CITATION-46] Garrett\u2019s reluctance to allow entry to the officer who checked up on unemployed men reflected the hostility many felt towards officials charged with inspecting the lives and homes of the poor. Often, neighbours worked together to thwart these invasive practices and took pride in victories that helped avoid the unwanted intrusion of the local state. The 1935 Government Housing Act required Local Authorities to monitor levels of overcrowding and led to the intrusive work of the \u2018Night Men\u2019, who arrived in the middle of the night to monitor how many people slept in each house and to ensure girls and boys had separate sleeping areas. Families living in overcrowded conditions faced the threat of prosecution and could even have their children removed. Unsurprisingly, the practice was very unpopular and faced significant resistance:\u2018Bang, bang\u2019 at the door and they\u2019d put their head through the window and say, \u2018who is it? and he\u2019d say \u2018The Night Man\u2019\u2026. So, what used to happen was, they\u2019d shove all the kids out the midden (the wall bin) and into the house next door while the Night Man did a search: \u2018Who sleeps here?\u2019 and \u2018Who sleeps there?\u2019 Then, when\u2019d come to the next house, all these kids would traipse back, as well as the kids belonging to that house. They\u2019d all go in and that\u2019s the way it was, all up the street.[CITATION-47] These small but powerful acts of defiance mattered. They were not only aimed at avoiding prosecution or the removal of children, but they also gave families the opportunity to assert some control over their domestic space and own lives by working collectively with their neighbours.It was within this context of co-operation with neighbours, resistance against the unpopular presence and invasive tactics of the police and the local state, and ongoing problems of poverty, that widespread cultures of buying and selling stolen goods persisted in working-class neighbourhoods. Memoirs stress the frequency of petty crime: Elsie Osman, born in Salford in 1918, remarked that \u2018fiddling went on \u2026 Make no mistake\u2019.[CITATION-48] Robert Roberts\u2019snoted that the complex relationship between affluence and prestige was a possible cause of local resentment and discord, suggesting that the \u2018temporary \u201cflushes\u201d of thieves served only to lower their status further\u2019.[CITATION-49] Yet other personal testimonies indicate that the wrath of neighbours was more likely to have been incurred if stolen goods were not fairly distributed: \u2018No matter what it was they got, they shared out\u2014it wasn\u2019t sold\u2019, reported one of Ayers\u2019s interviewees: \u2018The whole street\u2019d have them, they all got shared out\u2019.[CITATION-50] Such autobiographical accounts suggest that in these urban neighbourhoods there were expectations that these kinds of criminal acts should benefit their community and those seen to be overly exploitative, as in Roberts\u2019s account, risked condemnation. These attitudes towards theft survived during and beyond the Second World War at least, shaping accepted practices of \u2018fiddling\u2019 that housewives saw as less contentious and more morally acceptable than black marketeering.[CITATION-51] One 1949 study noted that \u2018there is a growing element in the population that is willing to purchase through illegal channels without enquiring too closely into the vendor\u2019s title to the good he offers for sale\u2019. It suggested that cases of theft increased by more than 65 per cent between 1938 and 1947.[CITATION-52] The premise that stolen goods should benefit local inhabitants was not necessarily incompatible with women offenders\u2019 ability to turn a profit. Court records do suggest that most goods were sold, but at far cheaper prices than in the shops. In 1926, Sarah Green of the Falls Road area of Belfast admitted to the police that two boys visited her home, having been sent by a friend of hers \u2018to see if I could buy some stuff. They had those two bags with them. They threw open the bags, they were full of stuff. I told them I had no money and I could not buy all that stuff. They said could I not sell some of it for them as they wanted some money. They then said I could have all the stuff for \u00a34\u2019. Sarah drove a tough bargain and paid the boys just two pounds and fifteen shillings for the substantial cache, which included three coats, four silk dresses, six gloves and more. One of Sarah\u2019s customers, who lived around the corner, stated that she \u2018came to my house and sold me the two pairs of shoes and dressing gown\u2019 for 15 shillings.[CITATION-53] For context, Lewis\u2019s, a popular department store chain, typically advertised dressing gowns at a cost of between 27 and 47 shillings.[CITATION-54] Sarah Green\u2019s case highlights the economic role of stolen goods: thieves offloaded goods to women who sold them for a decent profit to friends and neighbours, who were still getting bargain goods\u2014particularly for clothing. Selling stolen goods provided a useful service for many families struggling to make ends meet and it was in many neighbours\u2019 interests to keep quiet about this illegal practice. The few cases in the Quarter Sessions where it is clear that the police intervened as a result of complaints from neighbours usually related to violent or sexual crimes.[CITATION-55] A rare instance involving theft occurred in 1938, when a woman gave herself up to the police: the 69-year-old woman confessed to stealing from the money club she had organised for friends, after falling into debt when her husband fell ill. The woman made it clear to police that she had nowhere else to turn, explaining that \u2018tonight I realised I could not pay out and I do not know of any place where I could borrow the money to pay out so I thought I would come to tell you as I am at my wits end\u2019.[CITATION-56] This exception highlights the challenges faced by women who transgressed local bonds of neighbourly belonging\u2014particularly through theft from their friends.Neighbourly cohesion inevitably faced some threats in the Second World War. The looting of bombed or empty houses\u2014particularly raiding gas meters for coins\u2014reflected a new acceptance of small thefts against neighbours. In 1941, one Salford woman admitted: \u2018I had about a pound each out of four meters\u2019, having broken into \u2018houses that had been left \u2026 We got money in them all\u2019.[CITATION-57] However, these thefts were not necessarily seen as offences against the community as \u2018there was never any aggravation with it, it was a clean break-in; nobody got beaten up in their beds\u2019.[CITATION-58] Homes became riskier places to store and sell stolen goods as the impact of bombing often required families to share dwellings or move around, which jeopardised the necessary security and secrecy. Peggy Spring, for example, a convicted thief and bigamist, moved into rooms with her mother and three children, where she stole her landlady\u2019s purse from the mantelpiece.[CITATION-59] Subsequently, offences by women who had newly moved to a street seemed to be less accepted by neighbours, who may well have resented unknown arrivals at a time of upheaval and seem to have had little tolerance for those who did not conform to the locally established codes around criminality. In 1942, for instance, police found two women who had moved into the same terraced house in Birkenhead, which was divided into separate living areas, using two easy chairs stolen from their neighbour\u2019s house. They were caught within hours of the theft.[CITATION-60] Women\u2019s close friendships and obligations to each other persisted in wartime and beyond, however. One Belfast woman caught by police burning towels stolen from the Ministry of Public Security in her fireplace confessed that she had done so to help her friend and neighbour:I went to my door and she said I am in great trouble. It\u2019s over the ARP I have a parcel and I want you to keep it for me. You will be one great friend to me if you do this. I went round with her and Joe gave me the parcel out of the coal house and said \u2018Mind Mrs Boyle doesn\u2019t see you\u2026\u2019 when I saw you I put these in the fire and then I heard you at the door \u2026 Before she gave me the parcel I saw you two at her house.[CITATION-61] The woman\u2019s testimony stressed her willingness to help her neighbour but also pointed to new concerns about certain neighbours as informants together with the visible presence of police in the district. These conditions may have created a less secure environment for women to participate in the buying and selling of stolen goods but the case suggests they were still willing to take risks for their friends and neighbours.Post-war memoirs of inner-city areas that remained untouched by slum clearance continue to point to the reliance neighbours placed on each other, perhaps out of mutual respect or from fear or intimidation. Autobiographies note the continued prevalence of stolen goods as rationing continued after the end of the war. Some from among those who were children at the time recalled later that they would get food from sailors to share around: \u2018the dockers used to say \u201cAll right girl, come on\u201d \u2026 they would give you a big handful of bananas, a big handful, quite a few pounds worth\u2019.[CITATION-62] Some ports remained very challenging to police, and Leslie Robinson, who worked as a policeman on Birkenhead docks in the 1950s, recalled that staff \u2018made sure we saw nothing we were not supposed to see, I\u2019ll bet my last bob that there was no reduction in the amount of goods that found their way out of the docks\u2019.[CITATION-63] These examples emphasise that the practice of stolen goods prevailed in some working-class areas, particularly as the impact of rationing and price control measures contributed to a growth in the buying and selling of purloined goods more generally, with, as we have seen, 3,433 cases of receiving of stolen goods in England and Wales in 1938, increasing to 10,132 in 1945 and 10,002 in 1958 ().The general acceptance of the criminal activity associated with the procurement of stolen goods in working-class neighbourhoods of cities such as Belfast, Liverpool and Manchester reflected important ways in which deviance was defined locally and the expectations that crime should benefit these communities. It was not uncommon for women shopkeepers to exploit their connections in the clothing business to provide local women with cheap stolen goods. This practice may have been less widespread elsewhere, as memoirs of the East End of London suggest that, in certain markets, traders were involved in the selling of stolen goods.[CITATION-64] Yet in the 1920s many single-unit retailers in the North West experienced significant financial difficulties and may have sought alternative, and illicit, income streams.[CITATION-65] In 1921, police investigating a warehouse theft by a man named Thomas Rourke charged Elsie Brown with receiving at her terraced house on Medlock Street, which encompassed a clothing shop downstairs and her living space upstairs (). The police searched her bedroom and found, hidden behind two large pictures propped against the bedroom wall, \u2018covered over with some clothing\u2019, four packs of twelve jumpers (sweaters), 80 yards of fabric and six gowns. The police found no entries for these items in Elsie\u2019s broker\u2019s book, either as purchases or sales, but she claimed, \u2018oh yes, I bought them off that man and sold them, I was too upset to tell you before\u2019.[CITATION-66] Similarly, in 1929, police in Belfast caught Alice Evans with a significant haul of stolen children\u2019s clothing, including vests (undershirts), trousers and coats, wrapped in a tablecloth hidden behind a cabinet in her kitchen. Alice, a mother of several young children, lived in a dwelling separated into a shop area and a home section.[CITATION-67] As we saw with Sarah Green in Belfast, women could make a good profit from these crimes and often had a ready customer base for their spoils. In Elsie Brown\u2019s case, the police located twelve jumpers and five gowns in other homes on Medlock Street, sold to neighbours by Brown within days of Rourke\u2019s warehouse raid.[CITATION-68] However, it is also plausible that these offenders felt beholden to their neighbours, reflecting complex and claustrophobic community bonds. The involvement of struggling shopkeepers in stolen goods inevitably harmed their ailing businesses, as they would find it difficult to return to selling higher-priced legitimate goods. As Roodhouse notes, interviews undertaken by the Mass Observation movement with middle-aged women in 1947 revealed that they would take their business elsewhere if they felt shopkeepers had not given them enough goods in exchange for their coupons and we can see potential similarities with the practice of stolen goods.[CITATION-69] At the same time, however, Brown\u2019s use of the home, rather than the retail space, to hide the stolen clothes pointed to the belief that domestic space afforded greater secrecy and the intimacy required to engage only those known to them with illicit goods.Medlock Street, pictured in 1903. Receiver Elsie Brown occupied one property here in 1921, with shop premises downstairs; but she used the domestic space upstairs to hide stolen goods.: Manchester Libraries, Information and ArchivesPolice often highlighted symbols of domesticity in their statements against women suspected of dealing with stolen goods. For example, in a case in 1932, a man was charged with selling purloined watches at his friend\u2019s mother\u2019s house and the offence was described by the suspected thief as taking place \u2018in the parlour \u2026 There was a small dressing table in it, two small chairs, and armchair and a bed \u2026 (his) mother gave me a cup of tea and a sandwich\u2019.[CITATION-70] As we shall see, food and domestic comfort emerged strongly in the testimony of young male thieves who described their dealings with women purveyors of illicit goods. The emphasis on signs of feminine hospitality in police and witness statements reflected the expectations placed on working-class women as homemakers; the presence of illegal dealings in these settings could be used in to build up evidence of a crime having taken place. In Belfast in 1926, police raided an address in the Falls Road area where they found \u2018four dresses, cloth, pair of gloves, pair of stockings and small clock produced in the kitchen \u2026 In the front bedroom I found the fur coat, tweed coat, five pairs of gloves and three pairs of stockings produced\u2019. While one policeman questioned the inhabitant, Sarah Duffy, her daughter took another \u2018to the front bedroom upstairs. From a secret recess under a cabinet she took a case containing the two gold brooches, silver purse, string of pearls, a case of imitation pearls, some tea knives, three fish knives, three forks, and teaspoons and a pair of sugar tongs\u2019.[CITATION-71] The large haul and its varied location within Sarah\u2019s home reveals how certain items, especially clothes, were less incriminating and easy to sell to visitors to the house. Valuable items such as jewellery jarred with everyday domesticity and were kept hidden from visitors, who might want to steal them, as well as from the police.These cases expose the risks presented by using the home for the buying and selling of stolen goods, as women relied on mirroring the widely accepted practice of visiting homes for neighbourly sociability and mutual help, which allowed offenders to operate inconspicuously. One 1924 case occurred in the houses near Belfast\u2019s docks, where Annie McNally had received seventy-two stolen blouses from her stepmother and sold them from her own home. One of her friends admitted: \u2018I know the Prisoner \u2026 I saw a number of blouses in a box on the kitchen table. There was a blue blouse and a lemon blouse \u2026 an almond and a champagne coloured blouse \u2026 they were embroidered \u2026 I bought the champagne one for \u00a31 and paid \u00a31 on account\u2019.[CITATION-72] The testimony suggests women felt relatively relaxed when buying stolen goods from their friends\u2014taking their time and choosing carefully from a wide range of items. At the same time, the practice risked revealing the quantities of goods that had been stolen and implicating a significant number of women once the theft had been exposed by police. Annie attempted to take the goods back from her friend following a visit by the police to her stepmother\u2019s house: \u2018she came to me and said \u201cDo you know the blouse I sold you,\u201d I said I did, She said \u201cWell give it to me\u201d \u2026 She told me that she had taken the other blouses back to her stepmother and that it was for her stepmother she had been selling them\u2019.[CITATION-73] The urgency with which Annie visited her friend to take the stolen blouse back was expedient and an attempt to hide evidence but she may have also wanted to avoid getting her friend into trouble with the police, which would probably have risked causing local tensions, unwelcome scrutiny from the state and perhaps even her own ostracism.There was also a danger that customers might refuse to buy the goods offered or were unwilling to keep quiet about the presence of purloined goods in a home. Anna Smith, a domestic servant living in Manchester\u2019s Chorlton on Medlock, admitted that her friend Mary Cunningham came to visit her with some stolen blankets on Christmas Eve in 1938. Anna testified, \u2018in the front room of the house she asked me if I would buy the woollen\u2019. Rachel White, also living nearby, told police Mary visited her on Christmas Day and \u2018was crying\u2019 and asked her to buy some blankets, explaining \u2018she said they were a Christmas present to her but she did not want them, she wanted money\u2019.[CITATION-74] Mary was typical in drawing on her friends in the locale to buy stolen goods, but her visit on Christmas Day and Rachel\u2019s description of Mary\u2019s tears suggests that she relied on close contacts for financial aid in times of difficulty and that selling illicit goods reflected a wider culture of mutual help and friendship.[CITATION-75] Tears were often used by female defendants to perform expectations around \u2018emotional suffering\u2019 and Mary\u2019s crying may have been a way to discourage Rachel from divulging what had occurred between them.[CITATION-76] Rachel\u2019s telling of the story may have also emphasised Mary\u2019s tears in the hope she would be treated sympathetically by the police. As Armitage recalled of working-class life in Leeds, \u2018folk helped each other in time of trouble. The fact that two families were not on friendly terms or that the sons of both houses had been fighting the night before made no difference, if help were needed help were given\u2019.[CITATION-77] The bonds of friendship and sympathy towards the struggles other woman faced, alongside an ongoing hostility towards the police, helps explain why they were generally eager to keep quiet about the offences and reflected the practical and emotional ways female offenders assisted each other within other criminal subcultures.[CITATION-78] These social bonds, endorsed through an engagement with illicit goods, tied women to their communities with both negative and positive consequences. When Sarah Green was arrested in Belfast in 1926, two of the women to whom she had sold goods defended her to the police. One woman, living on the Falls Road, testified that she had bought knickers, pyjamas, a cap and nightdress for 15 shillings, claiming Sarah \u2018said a dealer sent them up to her. I know (the) prisoner a considerable time and a decent respectable woman\u2019.[CITATION-79] Similarly, the neighbour who bought the shoes and dressing gown from Green, claimed Sarah \u2018said they belonged to a woman whose husband wanted to cross the water. Prisoner is a decent respectable woman as far as I know. I know her some time\u2019.[CITATION-80] The willingness of these women to defend Sarah\u2014note the repeated emphasis on their description of her as \u2018a decent respectable woman\u2019\u2014may have reflected their friendship, fear, or a feeling that they owed her their loyalty in some way. Certainly, some women who dealt in stolen goods resorted to threats of violence, with some involved in wider networks of crime. In 1921, police investigating a series of jewellery robberies by a gang of male thieves visited the Bolton home of Mary Mason. Although Mary claimed the men \u2018had sold her nothing\u2019, a local auctioneer testified that she had sold him numerous stolen goods worth over \u00a38, including opera glasses, razors, brooches and watches. Searching her home, police found a police staff \u2018hanging by the fireside\u2019 in Mary\u2019s parlour and a stolen silver cigarette case \u2018on the mantelpiece\u2019. The position of these items suggests that Mary used the room to undertake her business and felt confident enough to flaunt stolen items, such as the silver cigarette case, as a sign of status and her prowess as an offender. The menacing and visible presence of the staff hints at a willingness to use violence to defend herself or her home and livelihood if under threat. Surrounding the fireplace, mantelpieces were the focus of working-class domestic interiors and were where women tended to keep both illicit and licit jewellery and money.[CITATION-81] The deliberate positioning of the case and staff communicated Mary\u2019s power and standing to all visitors and points to the position she sought to command locally. It also shows that the use of domestic space by female offenders brought risks to the home, as the very incriminating presence of these items made it clear to the police that the home was the location of illicit behaviours. Police descriptions of Mary\u2019s home have similarities to Bell\u2019s analysis of crime scene photography, emphasising symbols of the domestic in juxtaposition with evidence of criminality to signify that the location was a site of wrongdoing.[CITATION-82] Similarly, in 1921, 65-year-old Margaret Lyle appeared in court on charges of receiving stolen silver and plated items, including spoons, a teapot and a silver salver, in her home on Grosvenor Street, close to Manchester city centre. Margaret displayed the salver (stolen from a nearby constitutional club and presumably easily identifiable as such) prominently in her parlour, having attempted to rub away its crested stamp and engraved her surname and \u20181914\u2019 on it; she reportedly told the police, \u2018this is a present I have had for many years\u2019. When questioned alongside 48-year-old Brian Farrell, suspected of stealing the silverware, Margaret told the police, \u2018\u201cI did not know they were stolen\u201d, and putting her hand on the prisoner Farrell, said \u201cthis man left them at my house\u201d\u2019. It is unclear if Margaret touched Farrell to signal to the policeman that there was something intimate about their relationship, to promise Farrell that there might be as a reward for his help, or to command his co-operation, but it was certainly a confident and assertive gesture that indicated she felt in charge of the situation. In the subsequent court case, Margaret was revealed to have had several convictions for larceny, had her two children removed, and owned \u2018considerable property\u2019. During the prosecution for this offence, she paid a witness to pose as her son and offer false evidence in her defence. The Recorder observed, \u2018a worse character I cannot imagine a woman having\u2019.[CITATION-83] These disclosures ensured that Margaret received the relatively harsh sentence of 18 months hard labour. The outlandish display of the stolen goods within her home may have reflected Margaret\u2019s experience as a seasoned female offender, but certainly helped to expose her criminal dealings. However, her case, alongside that of Mary Mason and her police staff, suggests that these women may have been violent or threatened violence towards those they worked with or perhaps that they participated in a wide range of offences and collaborated with larger criminal gangs.Women offenders such as Margaret Lyle, Mary Mason and Edith Jenkins contributed to wider criminal enterprises and commonly worked with male thieves who were responsible for significant raids on warehouses or the railways: for example, 43-year-old Elizabeth Warren received a sizable parcel of stolen clothing taken from the North Staffordshire Railway Company by a gang of local men.[CITATION-84] These collaborations underpinned the large-scale practice of buying and selling stolen goods by women, but working with male criminals presented acute risks of violence and exploitation. Detective Constable Frank Edwards investigated a warehouse robbery in Salford in 1929 and found a large quantity of stolen clothes at the home of a middle-aged woman named Sarah Broad. Sarah\u2019s friend Maureen Keegan was staying in the house and was wearing \u2018a scarf similar to one stolen\u2019.[CITATION-85] A note from the jury requested that the Recorder \u2018deal leniently with her (Sarah Broad) on account of environment and coercion\u2019. Both Sarah and Maureen were bound over for two years for handling stolen goods and the three men who had undertaken the warehouse raids each received prison sentences of ten months. Maureen\u2019s testimony explained that she had known the ringleader, Francis Grey, and his wife for many years and claimed to have only been given \u00a35 and some stockings for her assistance and that Broad, forced into keeping the goods at her home, received \u00a310. Grey\u2019s long friendship with Maureen probably facilitated his remarkably sympathetic account of the women\u2019s involvement and he claimed that Maureen \u2018begged us not to do it but we took no notice \u2026 After a lot of persuading she said she would come for my sake to keep me out of trouble\u2019. Grey explained that Sarah only co-operated following violent threats from one of the other thieves, Thomas Walker. Grey stated, \u2018when we took the first load home Mrs Broad would not let us in, but Walker threatened what we would do if she did not help us and owing to the way we carried on with her we made her let us take the stuff but she said she wanted nothing to do with us\u2019.[CITATION-86] The notes in the court records emphasise that Sarah said nothing apart from, \u2018I did not open the door\u2019, referring to her response when the men arrived at her home with the stolen goods, suggesting she feared reprisals. Maureen\u2019s presence in Sarah\u2019s home when the police arrived may have been because Maureen distrusted Sarah or because Sarah was frightened and feared the men\u2019s return. The case illustrates some of the threats women were exposed to, and, for every Mary Mason commanding a criminal gang from her parlour, there would be a woman like Sarah Broad, forced by violent male thieves to use her home for their offences.Although these entrepreneurial female receivers and their links to violence were most prominent in the 1920s, collaborations with male thieves continued through wartime as the impact of rationing and price controls expanded the market for stolen goods. Roodhouse identifies a widespread \u2018grey market\u2019 during the Second World War and the 1950s, using the term to describe the many small illegal acts that were deemed morally acceptable as ways to deal with rationing and shortages. Roodhouse claims that \u2018the ability of a working-class family to support itself through grey marketing was greatly helped by increased wartime mobility, which loosened working-class social networks, spreading them over larger distances\u2019.[CITATION-87] We can see the impact of war in women\u2019s increased mobility, which facilitated their buying and selling stolen goods by forging collaborative alliances with men previously unknown to them. In 1943, a 25-year-old Belfast housewife claimed that she and a friend had met a man by chance in the city centre who then started to appear \u2018at the corner near my house\u2019, where she began to buy clothes and shoes from him regularly.[CITATION-88] Similarly, in 1944 Hilda Duffy received a \u00a320 fine and was bound over for two years for handling numerous stolen goods including furs and jewellery stolen by her companion, a dockworker who befriended her when walking home from work. Duffy explained to police that \u2018he told me he had bought them off a chap. I took them home and kept them in my room\u2019.[CITATION-89] These cases do point to the involvement of more transient men and women, as does the 1944 case of Mary Dunne, accused of selling children\u2019s clothes around Chorlton-on-Medlock after police found stolen \u2018dresses were under the bed and some between the bedcloth\u2019.[CITATION-90] Dunne claimed that her lodger, Margaret Fold, who had moved in eight weeks previously, had returned with a man, Richard Miller, and a large amount of goods; \u2018when they bought the stuff into the house I asked them where they had got it from and Richard said \u201cNever you mind where we got it from that\u2019s nothing to do with you, try and sell them we have no money\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-91] Wartime conditions, and the potential to make lots of money on the black and grey market, perhaps attracted new types of offenders who were less beholden to the bonds of local community than had been the case before the war. At the same time, memoirs suggest that women offenders adapted to wartime conditions. Veronica Blyth\u2019s mother worked as a licensed moneylender in the 1930s while also storing stolen food in the cellar: \u2018we had big hams hanging down there \u2026 I think it used to come from the docks\u2019. During the war, her mother would:buy coupons from people who came to the door \u2026 food coupons and clothes coupons. I think buying coupons was pretty illegal too. I think she would have been put in jail. She\u2019d have had a bloody good fight, I\u2019m sure, if they\u2019d have taken her! Oh God, she had a terrible temper![CITATION-92] Veronica\u2019s recollections highlight continuities with pre-war offences, with her mother buying and selling from neighbours and relying on their fear of her to evade prosecution. Veronica\u2019s own confusion about the illegality of her mother\u2019s actions further reinforced the ongoing acceptance of these offences among her community. Despite changes in legislation during the war to deter these kinds of crimes therefore, the war \u2018did not seem to profoundly alter people\u2019s perceptions of the law, right or wrong\u2019.[CITATION-93] Once the war ended, working-class women continued to buy and sell stolen goods to neighbours in ways that were similar to pre-1939 practices, particularly in areas that had not yet experienced housing redevelopment and slum clearance. In 1947, Frances Coyle, a housewife living near the Falls Road area of Belfast, told police that she was doing housework when a woman she knew called around: \u2018she said \u201cI have a wee tea set\u201d. \u2026 I said \u201cI don\u2019t need these\u201d. She then said \u201cI need the money\u201d\u2019. Bringing the basket inside, her son, off work with shingles, \u2018had no money and asked me to buy them for him until he got his pay on Friday. I did this to please him\u2019. Paying \u00a32 for the set, Frances claimed that her friend had stated that her husband had brought her the set and that she \u2018didn\u2019t doubt this\u2019, having known the woman for seven years \u2018and I always trusted her\u2019.[CITATION-94] Mirroring cultures of visiting, buying from a woman she had known for a long time, and using the home to buy and sell stolen goods shows that patterns of offending persisted through to the 1950s and beyond in areas that had not then been subjected to housing clearance, notably the inner areas of Salford, Belfast and Birkenhead.[CITATION-95] For example, in Belfast in 1958, Laura Doherty was prosecuted for receiving stolen goods, including clothes worth over \u00a3200 sold to women in the New Lodge area. Doherty admitted selling \u2018the frocks \u2026 round the street\u2019, while one of her customers confessed that Doherty \u2018is known in the neighbourhood as selling things for other neighbours\u2019.[CITATION-96] Since Doherty included an illicit radio within her impressive cache of stolen goods, there may have been some shift in the type and range of goods sold by women offenders, but the sheer quantity of clothing she peddled locally indicates a startling amount of longevity in the illegal buying and selling of goods by working-class women within their local communities. Consequently, memoirs note the ongoing importance of the home for hiding, buying and selling stolen goods. The comedienne Crissy Rock described her childhood in central Liverpool, when thieves would regularly come \u2018knocking on your door, trying to flog the stuff they\u2019d stolen\u2019, saying \u2018\u201cGot some lovely dresses here, love\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-97] At the same time, however, by the 1950s women offenders might be more isolated from female networks. One woman, described in court records as being a \u2018mental deficient\u2019, moved to Manchester in 1955 where she swiftly obtained an eighteen-month prison sentence after being convicted of receiving 160 shirts and sixteen raincoats, stolen by two men from a warehouse. Her testimony explained she had met one of the thieves a fortnight before the offence took place and \u2018I let him have a back bedroom upstairs\u2019; she told police that \u2018he had only been at the house a couple of days, when he said that he was going to go out and do some jobs. I knew what he meant and told him I didn\u2019t want any knocked off stuff in the house\u2019. The woman described being woken by the two men as she lay asleep, as they brought numerous boxes into her bedroom. \u2018When they left, I packed the shirts up in the wardrobe and the raincoats in the sideboard drawers. They told me that they\u2019d see me right when they were sold. I definitely knew the stuff was knocked off and I can only see that they used me for a mug\u2019. The police report noted that she confessed immediately when the police questioned her, admitting the goods were in the wardrobe: \u2018I knew they\u2019d been knocked off\u2019.[CITATION-98] This direct confessional language was rare among female receivers before the Second World War, but was probably indicative of the woman\u2019s vulnerability. Such offenders may have been a product of post-war programmes of clearance and rehousing that facilitated the exploitation of more isolated women who were unlikely to benefit from the support and scrutiny of close networks of neighbours or friends.The important use of homes for women\u2019s buying and selling of stolen goods also facilitated offenders\u2019 reliance on their relatives and children for their crimes. Women purposefully involved children in their dealings with stolen goods, particularly in the 1920s, reflecting a belief that they benefited from training in this important strategy of economic survival. The 1925 case of a Salford receiver, Vera West, and a 19-year-old thief, Joseph Bridge, illustrates how older women trained children to develop skills in offending, particularly those youths with little other financial or emotional support. Bridge wrote to the Court while awaiting trial for stealing boots, ties, more than 1,500 cigarettes, scarves, raincoats, watches, collars, stockings and razor blades. He claimed that Vera had befriended him some years earlier after he fell out with his mother (a friend of Vera\u2019s) and was sleeping rough. Bridge painted her as a supportive figure helping him in his time of need: \u2018she told me not to be a fool and come in and she got me a good hot breakfast ready and she ask [] me to tell everything since I been out of the house\u2019. Bridge then went to live with Vera, suggesting that she became a kind of surrogate mother to him. The letter is, of course, an attempt to exonerate Bridge, but it also reveals that Vera trained him: \u2018she said\u2026 why don\u2019t you go pinching I heard you are a good runner and climber \u2026 Since then I started pinching. She told me to keep it quiet and not let your mother know I said trust me to that. She said you could put it all in my bedroom and I will dispose of it on one condition. It is Half and Half, She said don\u2019t forget I am taking the risk as well as you are\u2019. Bridge\u2019s testimony shows that Vera was at once caring and motherly\u2014cooking him breakfast and taking him into her own home\u2014but also strategic in making use of his skills and establishing the terms of their partnership. It would be tempting to see Bridge as a vengeful thief seeking to blame Vera, who had kept a clean record while Bridge had a long list of convictions for theft. Yet the evidence of a local man, who testified that his wife had given Vera\u2019s daughter money to pay for a blue coat, implied that Vera used her own children to facilitate the buying and selling of stolen clothes. Bridge\u2019s accusations that she trained youths for crime thus rang true. He stated that Vera had reminded him that thieving was an option, \u2018if you can\u2019t draw the dole\u2019, for a homeless and jobless youth like him. Joining her in business, she had allegedly suggested, was a better alternative than destitution or the workhouse.[CITATION-99] As with their physical use of the home for receiving, women merged their maternal roles with their training of children to contribute to their offences. In 1923, a Salford machinist, Gwen Harris, aged 37, stood accused of receiving jewellery stolen by 15-year-old Angela Williams. Angela told police that she had known Gwen for two years after becoming a friend of her daughter, \u2018and I have been going to their house for a long time\u2019. Angela\u2019s testimony displayed the conflicting feelings of fear and affection that she had for the older woman, who had threatened that \u2018if I didn\u2019t get her the watch \u2026 she would tell my father about the money I had given her previously\u2019. Gwen exploited Angela\u2019s affection, warning \u2018don\u2019t breathe a word to anybody or I will get into serious trouble\u2019, and fostered a sense of dependence as, although Angela left home each day, \u2018I have not gone to work. I have gone to the prisoner\u2019s house \u2026 This has happened every day\u2019. Angela noted that \u2018the prisoner has warmed my dinner in the oven\u2019, contrasting this act of care with Gwen\u2019s menacing behaviour as she instructed Angela to steal. Gwen even substituted Angela\u2019s clothes: \u2018I bought two hats at the prisoner\u2019s request and she told me to wear them outside so that my father would not recognise me\u2019.[CITATION-100] The case exposed the ways in which offenders used their maternal role to exploit children and made them feel part of the family home to incite them to steal. Gwen used her home to isolate Angela from her own family and ensure her silence and co-operation, but the testimony hints that Angela found it a welcoming place, echoed in other depositions by young thieves who noted the food and comfort they gained from women receivers.[CITATION-101] Although much of this grooming feels sinister to contemporary eyes, the training of children to acquire material wealth was an important way of giving them economic autonomy. It was therefore most widespread during the 1920s, when northern industrial towns and cities experienced especially high levels of unemployment and poverty with limited state welfare.[CITATION-102] Working-class memoirs illustrate the role children played in contributing to offences at their mothers\u2019 behest, particularly in the immediate post-First World War years and early 1920s when many poorer families experienced notable hardship. Albert Jasper (b. 1905) recalled inhaving to assist his father and brother-in-law in their glue-theft racket, noting that he did not \u2018remember ever getting anything out of this \u2026 (but) Mum wouldn\u2019t have let me do it for nothing\u2019. Looking back on his experiences through adult eyes, Jasper struggled to reconcile his mother\u2019s love with her willingness to let him participate in petty crime, writing, \u2018it\u2019s a marvel I didn\u2019t grow up criminal the things I had to do for them\u2019.[CITATION-103] In contrast, Joe Ayre (b. 1910) recollected in his memoir of hardship in Liverpool that his stepmother \u2018devised ways and means of exploiting us kids that would put Charles Dickens Fagin to shame\u2019. Ayre noted that \u2018we got a beating\u2019 if they did not bring home enough money and she rarely gave them enough to eat.[CITATION-104] These accounts imply that individuals recalled their experiences of growing up around crime in ways that reflected their wider attachment\u2014or lack of it\u2014to the maternal figure and to their wider sense of \u2018home\u2019. Mothers sending children to steal coal emerges as a theme in numerous memoirs, from that of the \u2018Queen of Shoplifters\u2019, Shirley Pitt, born in Lambeth in 1934, to that of Harry Smith, born in Barnsley in 1923, who recalled his mother warning him \u2018not to come back home until\u2019 their cart was \u2018filled to the rim with that lovely black brass\u2019.[CITATION-105] It is also borne out in police records, such as the case of three boys caught stealing coal in Accrington in 1927, with one claiming, \u2018my mother told me to get it\u2019.[CITATION-106] These examples show the importance of small acts of theft within working-class family life, but also demonstrate their mundanity and the regularity with which crime was present and normalised within familial domesticity, especially when state welfare remained limited.Some women offenders relied on children to provide testimonies for their defence, which would inevitably be a source of pressure and fear for the children, who would have had instilled in them the perils of implicating their parents to the police. Shopkeeper Elsie Brown, accused of selling stolen clothes to neighbours, depended on testimony from her thirteen-year-old daughter, Alice, for her defence. Alice claimed that she recalled seeing the alleged thief in her mother\u2019s shop, claiming: \u2018The prisoner was not in long, he put the parcel on the counter. I heard my mother say to him \u201care you sure they are straight.\u201d He said \u201cyou have nothing to worry about they are as right as rain\u201d\u2019. We do not know how willingly Alice gave this testimony, but it would have been a frightening experience lying or at least embellishing the truth to the police, knowing that her words had the power to condemn or exonerate her mother. Similarly, in the case discussed at the beginning of this article, despite Edith Jenkins\u2019s claims that she wanted to \u2018save my son\u2019, Matthew went to great lengths to exonerate his mother and implicate himself. Stressing that \u2018Mother has got nothing to do with this\u2019, Matthew told police he had not known Murphy before he moved into the family home with his girlfriend, following shortly after the departure of Matthew\u2019s father. He explained, \u2018we never did this in my father\u2019s time and then mother was in bed bad\u2019. Matthew insisted that when they returned home after stealing, \u2018mother was in bed at the time \u2026 I never heard Murphy tell Mother he could get goods cheap. Mother did not see us carrying the cloth \u2026 She was in the house then and could not see anything\u2019. The image of Edith as a na\u00efve maternal figure contrasted with the police portrayal of her as a calculating and devious thief: they suggested that \u2018Mrs Jenkins was not open with us \u2026 everything in the shop is the subject of larceny\u2019. Matthew\u2019s willingness to sacrifice himself for his mother was typical and reflected the important role working-class mothers had not just as household managers but as the \u2018prevailing spirit in the house\u2019.[CITATION-107] As Margery Spring Rice\u2019s 1939 study of maternal health noted, the physical survival of the mother was crucial for working-class families.[CITATION-108] Prison represented the \u2018death\u2019 of the mother and families risked the fate of children to try to ensure maternal survival, although in Edith\u2019s case it was unsuccessful and she received a punitive nine-month prison sentence.[CITATION-109] The prioritisation of the mother signalled what Madeline Kerr termed \u2018the power of the mum\u2019, instilled into children at an early age.[CITATION-110] Women in these communities relied on their daughters to support their buying and selling of stolen goods, which reflected wider patterns of working-class family life that expected daughters to stay in closely supportive roles to the maternal figure. In contrast, mothers seemed more willing to take risks for their sons as part of their expected duties of self-sacrifice. In 1933, a 26-year-old labourer, Arthur Swift, received nine months\u2019 hard labour for stealing cigarettes. His mother Elizabeth, a 48-year-old widow, was bound over for twelve months for storing and moving them, while his 25-year-old sister Ivy was found not guilty of being involved. Arthur had appeared at Elizabeth\u2019s Birkenhead home with \u2018a quantity of cigarettes in either a pram or a cot\u2019, that he had stolen from a local shop and wanted her to hide. Elizabeth told police she \u2018realised that if the cigarettes were found in my house Arthur would get into trouble and as he was my son I had no desire to see him in trouble\u2019. Elizabeth sent the stolen cigarettes in a parcel to her daughter, Ivy, who had recently moved to Cardiff, possibly to distance herself from her brother who had numerous convictions. Ivy then split the cigarettes between herself and friends, protesting that \u2018if I had known that they had not been come by honestly, I should not have had anything to do with them\u2019.[CITATION-111] The case exposes how the illegal handling of goods mapped onto established patterns and roles within working-class families, especially requiring daughters to take on risks as part of wider expectations around duty and self-sacrifice.[CITATION-112] Daughters tended to take on the more hazardous public roles of selling or delivering stolen goods to their mothers\u2019 customers or using jobs in shops to pass on illicit goods to their mothers.[CITATION-113] Sons embroiled in cases of theft, like Arthur Swift, commonly relied on their mothers to use female networks and privileged access to domestic space to hide or sell their stolen goods.[CITATION-114] This pattern reflected typical interpersonal dynamics within working-class households and illuminates how the distinctly gendered roles of children within cultures of offending in urban communities reinforced wider expectations regarding the different contributions made by sons and daughters.Women also exploited the strength of the maternal role and their vulnerability to male physical power when they tried to exonerate themselves from police accusations. Certainly, police statements keenly noted any signs of coercion or violence towards women offenders and reflected traditional approaches of the law to female thieves.[CITATION-115] In the case of Edith Jenkins, police statements inferred that Murphy, her male accomplice, struck a menacing figure. Murphy had pinned a discharged soldier\u2019s badge on himself while the police searched the house. Telling them, \u2018I am an old soldier and you will get nothing out of me. My mouth is shut\u2019, Murphy, the police statement notes, drew his finger across his mouth aggressively to emphasise his silence.[CITATION-116] Although violence against women was not uncommon, there are few cases within the records of the Quarter Sessions that explicitly reveal evidence of violence or coercion against women receivers of stolen goods. Nonetheless, women offenders drew on narratives around male violence to defend themselves, particularly in the 1930s as ideals about motherhood and the companionate marriage gave accused women a clear framework to talk about coercive relationships.[CITATION-117] In 1934, Gladys Bright faced charges in Birkenhead for fraudulently managing a lodging house, which she used to handle illicit goods with her partner David Ross. Explaining that she met David after getting divorced five years previously and caring for her son alone, Gladys presented herself as a dedicated mother: \u2018I worked hard to help the child myself \u2026 I believed and thought I was going to be married and have a home for myself and child\u2019. She claimed Ross was not the saviour she had hoped for and that \u2018he started to thrash me and my little boy\u2019. Gladys alleged that she and her son were victims of violence, telling police that \u2018all the offences I have done I have been made to do if I had not he would thrash me till I was black and blue. I wanted to leave him but he would not let me he watched me night and day and sometimes would lock us in the room so I could not go\u2019.[CITATION-118] Her strategy of claiming to be a vulnerable and devoted mother was successful: Ross received twelve months\u2019 hard labour, but the court acquitted Gladys on all charges, reflecting the power of the language of maternal devotion in 1930s Britain.[CITATION-119] At the same time as the Birkenhead case, however, Gladys was under warrant for failing to attend court in Bolton the previous year for fraud. Finally arrested in Edinburgh and returned to Bolton, Gladys made a similar attempt to exonerate herself using the same language that had been successful in Birkenhead. She explained that she had married \u2018a man who I though was straight and able to give myself and child a home, but \u2026 he was not what I thought him to be\u2019. Gladys referred to her success in Birkenhead, where she had \u2018proved I was under the influence of this man\u2019. Writing to the Bolton Recorder while on hard labour remand, Gladys drew on her tried and tested language of vulnerability: \u2018I have lost my child as well. I ask you to think I have suffered enough\u2019. However, the accompanying police report presented a very different image of Gladys, portraying her as an itinerant and persistent offender and neglectful mother with a substantial record of fraud and receiving. The report refuted her claims of victimhood and exploitation and asserted that since her divorce in 1930, \u2018she has led an unsettled life \u2026 she resided at many different places \u2026 She used many different names\u2019.[CITATION-120] Gladys\u2019s prolific offences and ability to convince at least one court of her innocence shows how effective the language of maternal sacrifice and victimhood could be for working-class women.Some women continued to rely on children to facilitate receiving during the war, but more commonly they used younger ones as carriers and messengers, rather than training adolescents in stealing, selling and keeping secrets, which may have been a result of new ideas about childhood innocence as a discrete stage of life.[CITATION-121] A woman caught with her neighbour\u2019s stolen easy chair in Birkenhead admitted that her friend\u2019s \u2018little girl helped me carry that one away\u2019.[CITATION-122] When Hilda Duffy heard about the arrest of a male dockworker who gave her stolen goods, she claimed: \u2018I got frightened and sent my little boy up to my brother\u2019s house \u2026 with the case with the two lady\u2019s coats in it\u2019.[CITATION-123] Memoirs note the continued engagement of children in offences, with boys describing looting bombed-out houses or keeping lookout while girls recall helping their mothers to acquire illicit food.[CITATION-124] At the same time, wartime conditions also ensured that women could use children in different ways for illegal material and financial gain, particularly fraud.[CITATION-125] During and after the Second World War, concerns around juvenile crime intensified.[CITATION-126] Police narratives around stolen goods subsequently drew on fears of rising youth crime and increased criticisms of working-class mothers, making it possibly more challenging for women to operate networks of stolen goods.[CITATION-127] In 1946, police charged Nora Gallagher and Emily Flynn, both 42, with receiving, and Flynn\u2019s son, James, and two further youths, John Briggs and Harry Shepherd, all 17, with theft. The boys had stolen forty-four rings, fourteen cigarette cases, twenty-eight watches and other items worth \u00a3350, which they took to Emily\u2019s Salford home where she gave some of the goods to Nora to sell. Emily\u2019s statement presents herself as a fearful and powerless woman: when she asked her son and his friends where the goods came from, \u2018they said, \u201cOh shut up. Why ask silly questions. You get rid of it and get as much as you can\u201d\u2019. Emily claimed to be particularly afraid of Briggs, explaining: \u2018I knew he was an absconder from a school, but I was frightened when he brought the stuff\u2019.[CITATION-128] Emily may, of course, have been exaggerating or even lying to minimise her involvement in the crime. Certainly, the Recorder, Noel Goldie, emphasised that the boys were manipulative and dangerous, describing theirs as \u2018the worst case that has come before me \u2026 these crimes are being committed by a gang of youths who are determined to prey upon the community\u2019. Although Goldie noted that the women were not the \u2018real receivers,\u2019 he declared his intention to \u2018protect the citizens against amateur fences like you\u2019. Goldie\u2019s harsh approach reflected wider criticisms of working-class motherhood. Emily Flynn, who, as the \u2018mother of nine children\u2019 and with no mention of a husband, was probably a vulnerable woman, received a nine-month prison sentence, her friend Nora Gallagher got fifteen months, and the boys were all committed to a Borstal youth detention institution for three years.[CITATION-129] As the cases, statistics and memoirs from the 1950s suggest, ongoing rationing and price control measures ensured that the market for stolen goods had not necessarily disappeared, despite the arrival of the post-1945 welfare state.[CITATION-130] At the same time, it may have become riskier and less profitable to deal in illicit goods as more families were relocated into new housing estates from the 1960s onwards. Charles Jenkins, born in Liverpool in 1937, described his experience of living in a terraced house in the city in 1943\u20134, where \u2018if something got stolen, you knew who had done it\u2019. When his family were rehoused to the city\u2019s outskirts in the 1960s, \u2018you did not know people. You did not know whether they were nice or a crook. There were different people from all over\u2019.[CITATION-131] Yet Jon Lawrence has challenged the idea of community decline in post-war Britain and argues that it existed in two competing and overlapping ways, both in the mind and also as small, everyday interactions.[CITATION-132] Recent scholarship on flatted estates in Glasgow suggests that the impact of housing redevelopment on communities was complex. Rather than \u2018the enforced communality characteristic\u2019 of tenements, it produced new forms of relationships between neighbours that \u2018were increasingly personalised and voluntaristic\u2019.[CITATION-133] These new forms of community possibly undermined the structures that had allowed the buying and selling of stolen goods to take place\u2014but we need to know more about how these new forms of housing may have facilitated different opportunities for offences by women. Wider post-war changes included an increase in the numbers of married women being employed outside the home, which perhaps also negated the need or opportunity for these kinds of offences.[CITATION-134] Nevertheless, criminological studies from the late 1990s note that receivers of stolen goods at that time typically sold items to close networks of friends and neighbours through pre-arranged meetings, in places considered to be private, such as the home and workplace, suggesting important similarities with the earlier practices uncovered here.[CITATION-135] New commercial cultures also emerged that privileged the theft of cars, televisions and money and which may have challenged women\u2019s expertise in home-based crimes. Yet for working-class women, there may have been new opportunities to use minor crime to challenge the continued social inequities they experienced. For example, the new welfare state created different forms of fraudulent offences, perhaps especially tempting for women, particularly relating to the exploitation of Family Allowance payments, which requires further exploration.By uncovering the nature and scale of working-class women\u2019s engagement with stolen goods in the North West of England and Belfast, this article has demonstrated the ways in which working-class women\u2019s participation in this offence reflected their social roles relating to motherhood, neighbourly relationships and in the home. The article challenges interpretations by historical criminologists which suggest the working classes only turned to crime in times of temporary hardship.[CITATION-136] In doing so, it has made three key claims. First, the generally widespread acceptability of this kind of crime in the neighbourhoods examined in the article\u2014especially in comparison to crimes against the community, or prostitution\u2014suggests that we might understand women\u2019s receiving as a form of active citizenship that has more in common with poorer women\u2019s cultures of protest than has been otherwise understood. Engaging in the trade in stolen goods was a way to redress the significant iniquities these women and their families experienced, as well as a response to economic need. Secondly, the training of children and the presence of this offence in homes was not seen by perpetrators and their communities as incompatible with the culture of domesticity; rather, by contrast, it was seen as important that children learn the skills involved, especially in the 1920s. Women receivers were often described by child offenders and victims in affectionate terms that highlighted acts of care and hospitality. This suggests that we may need to rethink cultures of care and welfare: non-violent crimes were not always seen as corrupting or problematic from the point of view of those involved. Finally, this research exposes working-class women\u2019s attempts to manipulate or respond to the police and the judiciary, especially by exploiting their roles as mothers and as potential victims, and demonstrates that they were not passive in the face of arrest or prosecution. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the sources and perspectives drawn from regional crime records and memoirs provide an effective lens through which to understand class-based and locally defined notions of deviance. This, in turn, sheds new light on the role of offences in working-class women\u2019s experiences of community and their conflicts with the state. These insights have the potential to change how we perceive working-class women\u2019s ability and strategies to rebuff and respond to state intervention and redress inequalities, prompting us to can rethink how we understand their roles and experiences in twentieth-century Britain more generally."

    "title": "Public Meetings, Respectable Requisitions, and Popular Politics in Great Britain and Ireland,c.1769\u20131850*",
    "author": "Richard Huzzey",
    "date": "09 May 2023",
    "text": "This article examines the practice of \u2018requisitioning\u2019 public meetings in Great Britain and Ireland. These written requests to office-holders emerged in Ireland and then Great Britain, following bitter contests over the authenticity and authority of addresses and meetings claiming to represent a county or town in the decade after 1769. If the Seditious Meetings Acts privileged meetings officially convened by local elites, they also codified the practice of householders signing their own advertisements to requisition meetings under magisterial oversight. This would, especially when revolutionary threats receded and local justices\u2019 sympathies permitted, allow local organisers some legal and constitutional claims to public assembly, even if Peterloo demonstrated the continuing threat of the Riot Act. Alongside bi-partisan opportunism encouraging public meetings, the article emphasises the creative use of constitutional and legal claims by \u2018political entrepreneurs\u2019. Comparison with Ireland demonstrates ministers\u2019 greater recourse to new legislation and executive powers, but also the exchange of political practices with Great Britain. The prosecution of intimidating numbers, rather than seditious conduct, after 1842 diminished the role of requisitions, as did the hybridisation of \u2018public meetings\u2019. This was not so much the loss of a demotic form of community deliberation, but a proliferation and multiplication of the meetings\u2014and voices\u2014claiming to represent public opinion. The changing uses of a subscriptional practice can illuminate the relationship between government initiatives and local enforcement, and highlight the talents of those forging new meanings of the law, the constitution, and the political nation from restrictive procedures.In 1817, William Arundell Harris \u2018damned himself to everlasting shame\u2019, at least in the eyes of political reformers and the radical press. As High Sheriff of Cornwall, he received a requisition for \u2018a meeting of the freeholdersof the county; which meeting he refused to call, because he was required to summon the inhabitants as well as the freeholders\u2019. In his official reply to the requisition, Harris expressed disgust at the notion that \u2018the freeholders and \u201c\u201d\u2019 would \u2018question, under my presidency, the wisdom of Parliament, and the propriety of imposing restraint on the seditious\u2019 in proposed legislation. Rather, he declared melodramatically that \u2018I cannot comply with the request of the requisitionists\u2014or give the slightest sanction to proceedings, of which the probable result will be the overthrow of the existing Government of this Kingdom, and the total subversion of our inestimable Constitution\u2019. Yet the meeting went ahead, and, notwithstanding such fears, no historian has yet traced Britain\u2019s first modern revolution to the subsequent gathering in Bodmin. Addressing that meeting, one of the \u2018requisitionists\u2019, the county magistrate John Colman Rashleigh, responded that if \u2018we have no right to question what takes place in Parliament, the term PETITION should be obliterated from our statute books; as we can only assemble to vote adulatory addresses to the Throne\u2019. Rashleigh whipped up the crowd with a series of rhetorical questions, asking what had ended the American war, banned the slave trade, and defended the Toleration Act? The answer, in each case, was \u2018the Petitions of the People\u2019, which had been \u2018productive of more salutary effects to the Constitution, than any other\u2019 liberty they possessed. The general inhabitants could not otherwise \u2018from their cots and hamlets, state either their wishes or their grievances\u2019, and they lost the opportunity for \u2018their judgements to be informed, or their ideas enlarged, if they are not allowed to attend public meetings\u2019. For this reason, Rashleigh mocked the idea \u2018that the right of Petition should not be allowed to large assemblies of the People, but be committed to a chosen few, who shall exercise it almost like conspirators\u2019, as Harris and the Tory government proposed.Chronicling these events, the radical editor William Hone concluded that \u2018[m]ayors and sheriffs sometimes exercise theiras if it conferred on them ato do wrong\u2019.[CITATION-1] But how did they exercise such power, and what was this \u2018requisition\u2019 that they might deny? The answers lie scattered among local government records and private papers in archives across Great Britain and Ireland. Requisitions to an office-holder asked him to convene a meeting, which Harris refused, though the signatories might still try to proceed and publicise a signed advertisement on their own initiative, as Rashleigh did. Being formal, written requests to an authority, bearing signatures or authorised names, requisitions are best considered as a species of petition, though they often sought meetings that would in turn generate a more numerously signed petition to another authority.[CITATION-2] Considering the \u2018form, function, and meanings\u2019 of political activities such as petitioning and meeting allows us to trace their \u2018hybridisation\u2019, as Joanna Innes argues, identifying \u2018cross-fertilization between existing types\u2019 of political participation as much as their popularisation.[CITATION-3] Requisitions raised two intertwined dilemmas over the \u2018representative claim\u2019 of speaking for a community: who could call and who should participate in such a meeting?[CITATION-4] Tracing the emergence and adaptation of requisitions in the British Isles illuminates a number of mature historiographical themes, not least how \u2018the press, the platform, and the petition\u2019 came to be so firmly identified as constituting \u2018public opinion\u2019 in Victorian Britain.[CITATION-5] This historicises the \u2018public sphere\u2019, or the emergence of a \u2018counter-public sphere\u2019, by contextualising \u2018vigorous print arguments about public opinion\u2019 that materialised in \u2018concrete assemblies\u2019 such as public meetings.[CITATION-6] Disputes over requisitions reveal practices surrounding the languages of the \u2018constitutional idiom\u2019 and those rationalities too easily dismissed as \u2018a general addiction to the forms and proprieties of organized constitutionalism\u2019.[CITATION-7] While Charles Tilly\u2019s social movement studies have located expanding repertoires of contentious politics in the \u2018parliamentarisation\u2019 of political demands in this period, a study of requisitions highlights how any \u2018rise of the public meeting\u2019 rested on local conflicts involving what Katrina Navickas terms \u2018the politics of space and place\u2019.[CITATION-8] Moreover, comparison between Ireland and Great Britain highlights not only the exceptional legislation against popular assembly in the former, but also the extent of ministers\u2019 reliance on local elites for political repression within the latter. This points to another interplay between local contexts and national patterns in enforcing \u2018the law\u2019 in reality.[CITATION-9] Focusing on practices, which materialised who the \u2018public should be\u2019 in the public meetings of a locale, may allow us to sidestep abstract \u2018phases\u2019 of democratisation centred on expansions of the parliamentary franchise for irregular elections.[CITATION-10] The first section of this article considers the definition, origin, and function of requisitions in Ireland and Great Britain, before reviewing their adaptation in relation to the changing nature of \u2018public meetings\u2019. Since this identifies their rise and decline in the context of legislative and judicial innovations, a second section considers these changes more fully by disentangling the roles of parliamentarians, officials, justices, and agitators, evaluating how far requisitions ultimately constrained or assisted the proliferation of public meetings. Finally, a third section focuses on the functions of requisitions as material assertions of who should meet to decide what questions. As the conclusion emphasises, the cumulative choices of local officials, organisers, and audiences ultimately weakened the privileges of organising public meetings by mid-century, even if ministers and judges succeeded in branding truly massive assemblies as \u2018seditious\u2019. A study of the requisition as a legal and cultural practice points towards the social creativity that repurposed formal structures intended to restrict new forms of political organisation. From this perspective, the spread of ticketed or non-deliberative \u2018public meetings\u2019 from the 1830s onwards marked the surrender, as much as the assertion, of a monopoly over who might call and attend meetings that spoke for a locality.Signed requests to call public meetings speaking for a locality acquired the name \u2018requisition\u2019 slowly and haphazardly. Clearly, requisitions formed part of a group of related rituals for advertising a meeting publicly, asserting its legality, and claiming to represent a community.[CITATION-11] When approved, requisitions could be reprinted for publicity in broadsides or newspapers; when declined, organisers might proceed regardless under their own initiative, as John Colman Rashleigh did, often repurposing the requisition as their own signed announcement.[CITATION-12] Requisitions for public meetings hybridised formal eighteenth-century requests for meetings of closed bodies, such as corporations, common halls, or burghs, with the advertised summons of \u2018general meetings\u2019 for a county\u2019s freeholders or, in Scotland, heritors.[CITATION-13] Rather than convening a body to administer a county, town, or parish, requisitions for deliberative \u2018public meetings\u2019 sought to pronounce on resolutions, addresses, or petitions.[CITATION-14] A distinct form of electoral requisition, used to demonstrate and marshal support for parliamentary candidates, falls outside the scope of this article but clearly shared some characteristics with the requisitions considered here.[CITATION-15] The noun \u2018requisition\u2019, following Latin usage, had a plethora of other meanings in legal, diplomatic, and military terminology, but thedates the transitive verb \u2018to requisition\u2019 to a county meeting in Ireland in 1800.[CITATION-16] Occasional specification of a \u2018written requisition\u2019 or \u2018public requisition\u2019 distinguished these documents from an oral and private tradition of asking office-holders to call and chair meetings.[CITATION-17] While it is difficult to identify their origins precisely, signed requests for public meetings of a county or settlement appeared with increasing frequency in the final decades of the eighteenth century. As early as 1775 \u2018Some freeholders\u2019, unnamed, inserted in thethe text of their request to the sheriff.[CITATION-18] In 1778of Dublin sometimes reprinted the signatories of requests to the city or county sheriffs to call meetings, listing names as it did for subscriptions or declarations.[CITATION-19] The Irish Volunteer movement, which emerged in 1778 to police agrarian protest and demand their parliament\u2019s independence from Westminster, occasionally used signed requisitions.[CITATION-20] One Dubliner condemned \u2018the daring and unprecedented measure of freemen and freeholders summoning a meeting of themselves\u2019, rather than relying on the sheriffs and justices to do so, as \u2018an outrage on the constitution\u2019.[CITATION-21] Written requests for public meetings to express a community\u2019s judgement, rather than to elect extra-parliamentary representatives, would remain commonplace throughout Ireland\u2019s constitutional and economic controversies of 1785.[CITATION-22] Although newspaper reporting confirms the use of requisitions across Ireland and Great Britain by 1780, it is hard to know whether the practice proliferated or press coverage of it increased. Certainly, an expanding provincial press in the later eighteenth century encouraged a positive feedback loop, with newspapers printing signed requisitions and other advertisements for public meetings, covering controversies about them, and establishing a \u2018civic Hansard\u2019 of local deliberations.[CITATION-23] Many of Christopher Wyvill\u2019s allies, seeking political and economic reform, publicly requisitioned officials in 1780 for English county meeting to launch their petitions.[CITATION-24] The duke of Richmond shared with the press the correspondence surrounding the rejection of his requisition for a Sussex reform meeting in 1780. The magnate\u2019s insistence that \u2018any gentleman of property and character is of equal authority\u2019 to a sheriff in summoning the county demonstrates how public requisitions might contest, rather than concede, official control over whether \u2018the people have a right to assemble themselves and deliberate on public affairs whenever they think proper\u2019.[CITATION-25] Such rhetoric echoed the New Englanders\u2019 defence of the statutory rights of propertied New Englanders to request notices and warrants for general meetings of their township, even where select-men refused to do so.[CITATION-26] After nearly 200 inhabitants signed petitions requesting a Boston town meeting, the Massachusetts Government Act of 1774 complained that \u2018a great abuse has been made of the power of calling\u2019 such meetings on \u2018matters of general concern\u2019, and required Crown permission for any \u2018called by the select men, or at the request of any number of freeholders\u2019.[CITATION-27] The American defence of community self-government against Crown control probably offered a further source of inspiration for written, signed requests to convene public meetings of a county or town in the British Isles.[CITATION-28] Meetings claiming to represent a locality had far older origins, of course. Gatherings of the gentry and nobility to deliberate and petition on behalf of a \u2018county community\u2019 stretched back to at least the thirteenth century in England and played an important part in the crises of the seventeenth century, when they were often tied to county meetings of the quarter sessions and to grand juries.[CITATION-29] In episodes of popular contention, notably in the \u2018Covenanted public politics\u2019 of Scotland, popular meetings of women and unpropertied men spoke for their communities outside the control and sanction of authorities.[CITATION-30] Both of Charles II\u2019s parliaments subsequently acted against \u2018Tumults and Disorders, upon Pretence of preparing or presenting publick Petitions, or other Addresses\u2019, as the English Act of 1661 characterised them; it demanded the approval of three justices or the majority of a grand jury for organising any petition with more than twenty signatories.[CITATION-31] The king in 1679 could dismiss a petition that lacked official approval as representing merely \u2018a Company of loose disaffected People\u2019, rather than the deliberations of a community.[CITATION-32] While the Bill of Rights of 1689 guaranteed the right to petition the Crown and implied freedoms to assemble and deliberate on such petitions, it left unclear the standing of the 1661 Act.[CITATION-33] Seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century chroniclers mocked petitions or declarations as \u2018surreptitiously obtain\u2019d\u2019 by the pretence that \u2018the Sense of a County lies in a High Sheriff and a Grand Jury\u2019 since \u2018the Court makes the one and the Sheriff the other\u2019.[CITATION-34] By 1769, the endorsement of an \u2018address agreed to and signed, in the name of the Freeholders\u2019 of Surrey as part of the thinly attended \u2018business of the Assize\u2019 evoked complaints that \u2018public notice should have been given\u2019 for a separate meeting to consider this.[CITATION-35] Contests over how to authorise the declarations of a county or settlement only intensified during a distinct series of disputes between government loyalists and their critics in the decade or so after 1769.[CITATION-36] During the controversy over John Wilkes\u2019s election for Middlesex, the sheriffs of Derbyshire and Yorkshire advertised county meetings at the instigation\u2014apparently private, rather than published\u2014of \u2018Many Gentlemen\u2019, while the foreman of the Buckinghamshire grand jury organised one despite his request being refused by the sheriff of that county.[CITATION-37] Both Wilkesites and loyalists accused each other\u2019s meetings of \u2018Spurious and Mock Addresses\u2019, pointing to the presence or absence of officials and leading families in a town\u2019s deliberations.[CITATION-38] During the crisis over the American colonies, both sides seized upon any evidence of a \u2018surreptitiously introduced\u2019 address[CITATION-39] purporting to represent a community \u2018without any previous Notice being given by Public Advertisement, or Public Meeting convened for such Purpose\u2019.[CITATION-40] Closed meetings, such as those of corporations or grand juries, could be challenged as unrepresentative of the \u2018sense of society\u2019 by public meetings,[CITATION-41] whether these were called by officials in response to \u2018the Request of many respectable gentlemen\u2019 or \u2018by public advertisement\u2019 from partisans themselves.[CITATION-42] In 1775, loyalists in Lancashire suggested that the circulation of an anti-ministerial petition represented \u2018the most impudent Usurpation that ever was attempted in Contradiction to the Sense of the County, almost unanimously declared at a publick Meeting\u2019 they had convened in Lancaster.[CITATION-43] Squabbles over the status of so many addresses, petitions, and resolutions emerging from growing numbers of rival meetings explain why written requests for official sanction multiplied in the later eighteenth century.[CITATION-44] Of course, at no point did meetings called by requisitions to office-holders, or after their refusal, provide the only means of political expression under the law. Men and women of all ranks represented their private interests in meetings, lobbies, and parliamentary petitions concerning their property or trade or role in local improvement schemes.[CITATION-45] Philip Loft identifies \u2018multiple layers to the political nation\u2019 throughout the eighteenth century, as \u2018the legitimate participants differed from issue to issue\u2019, and these issues were raised in petitions responding to particular legislation and interests. The same could apply to private meetings of interested parties, but did not customarily translate into county meetings, where active participation was reserved for freeholders, or town meetings, which were restricted to \u2018leading citizens\u2019, whose wealth qualified them to claim to speak for their community.[CITATION-46] However, where an area was deeply entangled in a particular trade, representation of an industry\u2019s interests might be blurred with claims to speak for a territorial community. Indeed, Henry Jephson\u2019s Victorian study of popular assemblies located his \u2018earliest example\u2019 in petitioning over the Cider Tax in 1763, which involved not just the owners of orchards or taverns, but also mass meetings that spread across counties with strong traditions of brewing\u2014and imbibing\u2014the beverage.[CITATION-47] Throughout the eighteenth century, growing numbers of private societies, clubs, and associations, including those specifically for women, could establish their own membership, speakers, and procedures in meetings that might reflect the populace more faithfully than the property-owners voting at the general meetings of a county or town.[CITATION-48] However, local officials and magistrates applied their own prejudices to judging the number, class, and purpose of people whose assembly might warrant threats of prosecution or violent dispersal. Scholars have long studied the politics of \u2018the mob\u2019, as it might be pejoratively dismissed, and how the Riot Act might be invoked or threatened against disorderly crowds.[CITATION-49] After a Fakenham farmer informally agreed to meet some of his struggling employees on market day in 1778, he denounced as \u2018contrary to law\u2019 the appearance of three or four hundred other labourers joining to discuss the affordability of food on their wages.[CITATION-50] Even when headed by the noble Lord George Gordon, the anti-Catholic petitioning campaign of 1780 led to a riotous march on Westminster, which Lord Mansfield judged as violating \u2018principles more ancient and more important than any regulations upon the subject of petitioning\u2019 in menacing Parliament.[CITATION-51] Meanwhile, where radicals aspired to preside over societies or associations with \u2018members unlimited\u2019, private gatherings remained open to accusations of treasonous conspiracy.[CITATION-52] By contrast, proceedings undertaken as\u2014or modelled on\u2014county or town general meetings offered agitators a form of orderly assembly not necessarily judged to be riotous.Therefore, the spread of written requisitions for meetings signalled the evasion, as well as a new exertion, of elite control over public meetings. The second and third sections of this article will trace the dynamics of regulation and exploitation, but it is instructive to assess how requisitioning adapted to the changing forms of public meetings and ultimately faded from the front line of local conflicts. If written requisitions reflected greater pressure on officials to call public meetings, debates continued from the 1780s to the 1830s over when a town meeting could be \u2018\u2019 by \u2018the requisition of private individuals\u2019.[CITATION-53] In counties, disputes proliferated over whether a \u2018meeting is not less a County Meeting because not called by a person appointed by the Crown\u2019.[CITATION-54] Moreover, requisitions took on new functions and purposes in changing legal and political environments, with the term extended to any signed announcement of a meeting. In Ireland, requisitions to Catholic leaders from their own propertied supporters provided public notice of \u2018aggregate meetings\u2019.[CITATION-55] This probably emerged from Dubliners\u2019 earlier practice of requisitioning civic aggregate meetings of both city freemen and county freeholders.[CITATION-56] After the Napoleonic Wars, English radicals used rejections of their requisitions as evidence of establishment corruption and as publicity for their own invitations to mass platform meetings.[CITATION-57] More than two decades later, Radicals and Chartists might submit requisitions to office-holders even as they fused the deliberative procedures of county and town meetings with the scale and openness of Methodist camp meetings.[CITATION-58] In 1838, George Mart pointed to an advertising placard as \u2018the requisition which called you together\u2019 for his open-air meeting in the Potteries.[CITATION-59] By this period, organisations might seek public meetings to consecrate the foundation of \u2018a mere private club\u2019, and the term \u2018public meeting\u2019 extended to events with no pretence of deliberation.[CITATION-60] Multiplying forms of community organisation and the growing use of door-to-door canvassing for petitions diluted the primacy of public meetings in deliberating on behalf of a locality by the 1840s.[CITATION-61] Signed requisitions consequently faded from the front line of battles over the authority of particular assemblies. A requisition for an aggregate meeting of Irish Catholics in 1851 collated hundreds of names, more as a declaration of support for Rome\u2019s restoration of episcopates than as a prompt for the event itself.[CITATION-62] Requisitions could still prove attractive when office-holders themselves wished to claim local support for a cause, as when the mayor of Liverpool organised \u2018one of the longest and most influential requisitions ever got up\u2019 to call a public meeting to protest the same \u2018papal outrages\u2019.[CITATION-63] The value of official meetings to local elites, then, outlasted the rise and fall of signed requisitioning as a front-line tactic in contests over who might claim to represent their community. Indeed, requisitioning survived in the internal rulebooks of local government as a means for elected representatives to call meetings of a council absent the chair\u2019s initiative, and it was reborn in permissive legislation empowering rate-payer democracy for public services.[CITATION-64] However, as the next section demonstrates, struggles over requisitioning left imprints on the legal and political culture of the United Kingdom that outlasted the practice itself.This section compares the political and legislative developments in Ireland and Great Britain that gave new meanings to requisitioning; then, it considers the distinct elements of local discretion in officials accepting a request and magistrates acting against a meeting; and, lastly, considers how far requisitions succeeded in controlling\u2014or legitimising\u2014the expansion of popular politics. Crucially, parliamentary legislation and government repression depended on local interpretation and enforcement. The Riot Act, passed in 1714 for Great Britain and adopted by the Irish Parliament in 1787, indemnified magisterial force for actions taken to suppress disorder, even if it provided no powers for preventing peaceful assembly.[CITATION-65] Ministers relied on the local landowning elite to read the Riot Act and prosecute treason, at least in Great Britain. Before and after the Act of Union, Dublin Castle exercised greater central control over public meetings in Ireland.[CITATION-66] For example, in October 1784, James Napper Tandy organised \u2018requisitions to Ireland\u2019s sheriffs, calling on them to summon their bailiwicks for the purpose of electing representatives\u2019 to a convention. The Attorney General of Ireland swiftly warned office-holders that \u2018summoning the freeholders and freemen to meet for such a purpose\u2019 would be \u2018highly criminal\u2019, and turned up personally to browbeat the sole compliant sheriff into cancelling the meeting as it assembled.[CITATION-67] When, in 1797, an English newspaper criticised the Lord Lieutenant\u2019s warning to requisitionists in Cork against \u2018meeting in unusual numbers,\u2019 as \u2018military coercion\u2019 and a violation of the \u2018inherent right of the subject, allowed by the constitution, and ratified at the revolution in 1688\u2019, it demonstrated ignorance of the uncertain status of the Bill of Rights in Ireland.[CITATION-68] The Dublin and, later, Westminster parliaments readily passed legislation with specific restrictions on public assembly in Ireland. In 1793, a Convention Act against \u2018the Election or Appointment of unlawful Assemblies, under Pretence of preparing or presenting public Petitions, or other Addresses\u2019 attempted to address the Catholic Committee\u2019s or United Irishmen\u2019s emulation of the Volunteer tradition.[CITATION-69] After magistrates disrupted the 1811 meeting of the Catholic Committee in Dublin, it took all of Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s lawyerly skill to ensure that \u2018the wording of the requisition be strictly warrantable under the provisions of the Convention Act\u2019 for \u2018an aggregate Meeting\u2019 advertised with 300 signatories. Such gatherings of Catholics and, later, nationalists explicitly disavowed the \u2018private invitation\u2019 of select audiences in order to demonstrate their lawfulness publicly; the term \u2018aggregate\u2019 became closely associated with Irish meetings of this kind.[CITATION-70] A series of emergency laws, from 1814 onwards, gave the Lords Lieutenant of Ireland further discretion to suspend public assembly in disturbed areas. From 1823, the Catholic Association\u2019s use of rent-paying membership and church structures evaded the existing laws on public meetings and led to a specific statute against \u2018unlawful societies in Ireland\u2019 in 1825. This proscribed Irish associations that sought to change the law and so renewed requisitioning of meetings as separate from charitable fundraising.[CITATION-71] Following Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of the Union repeal movement, the Acts of 1831 and 1833 against Tumultuous Risings and Disturbances provided further power to forbid meetings, including those convened to petition Parliament. The creation of a national constabulary in 1836 and the appointment of resident magistrates in place of local elites further distanced the situation in Ireland from the voluntarist, common-law approach to public meetings in Great Britain.[CITATION-72] These emergency measures and exceptions from localist practices subsequently offered a precedent for policing public assembly in the Empire.[CITATION-73] The Irish legislation, beginning with the 1793 Act, did not augur a parallel approach for the rest of the United Kingdom, contrary to British radicals\u2019 expectations.[CITATION-74] While Pitt\u2019s ministers encouraged prosecutions against seditious speech and suspended, they also sought to strengthen local control over those \u2018public meetings\u2019 held \u2018in the open air\u2019 and to license indoor venues.[CITATION-75] The Seditious Meetings Act of 1795 confirmed the privileges of all official meetings, placing new importance on whether and when an office-holder might agree to call one. Any other meetings of more than fifty people required a requisition signed by at least seven householders, in the form of a public advertisement or notice no less than five days in advance. This permitted local justices to forbid, reschedule, or even disperse meetings with a new proclamation and indemnity to enforce it violently.[CITATION-76] Although distinct, these two elements of local control could often become intermingled in controversial cases. The same individual might serve both as an office-holder deciding whether to agree the requisition for an official meeting and as one of those magistrates who could interpose if it proceeded by independent advertisement. The term \u2018requisition\u2019 was colloquially applied to both subscriptional forms\u2014of requests to office-holders and signed advertisements\u2014even if it was never mentioned in the Act. The Tories promoted the law, paradoxically, as both mere restatement of theand emergency powers essential to avert revolution. Lord Thurlow defended \u2018the glory of English law that there was no previous restraint on the people in the exercise of the important privilege of meeting to discuss grievances and petition Parliament\u2019, adding the sophistry that freedom was \u2018unrestrained, but its abuse was open to punishment\u2019.[CITATION-77] The practical intent and effect was to encourage local repression of perceived \u2018abuse\u2019 and deter mass audiences throughout the wars with France. The initial law expired in 1799, with short revivals and other repressive measures from Westminster used to encourage provincial vigilance.[CITATION-78] Local elites generally acted on ministerial prompts to interpret their powers more repressively in periods of revolutionary fear. Radicals and reformers did convene some public meetings in the later years of the war, including one supported by a requisition signed by 2,000 or more Mancunians in 1808.[CITATION-79] Building on these precedents, growing numbers of radical meetings \u2018combined demonstrations of strength with a commitment to order\u2019 after 1815. The Tories responded with a new Seditious Meetings Act in 1817 for Great Britain and in 1819 for the United Kingdom.[CITATION-80] Both laws again sought to reinforce local office-holders\u2019 confidence in forbidding and dispersing subversive gatherings, without trespassing on respectable meetings of local communities. The first bill revived until July 1818 the strict controls on how legal meetings could be called, adding provisions about adjourning meetings. The second revival was broader in scope, abandoning efforts to define matters of \u2018church or state\u2019 as distinct from others, and seeking to prevent non-residents from attending local meetings.[CITATION-81] In the period between the operation of either act, however, the Peterloo massacre provided sober proof of the legal and military powers available to magistrates regardless. Manchester radicals sought to demonstrate the legality of their rally, scrapping their original requisition because it suggested that they might trespass on parliamentary privileges. The staff of theprepared a fresh requisition, and a thousand householders swiftly \u2018placed on record their honourable Names\u2019 for a public meeting. The newspaper eagerly contrasted the \u2018honest hands\u2019 of these requisitionists with those \u2018pimps of authority\u2019 who had been \u2018begging for Signatures\u2019 for their requisitions from \u2018the dependent and alarmed minions of Power\u2019 and \u2018servile Publicans\u2019. While officials, predictably, declined the request to convene the radical meeting, the careful framing of the requisition posed a legal challenge to any magistrates wishing to prevent it from proceeding, not least as it far exceeded the requirements of the lapsed Seditious Meetings Act.[CITATION-82] Magistrates requested Home Office advice in advance on how and when they could declare the meeting riotous; when their actions killed eighteen and injured hundreds more of the gathered crowd, national debate and criminal prosecutions focused on the lawfulness of the magistrates reading the Riot Act.[CITATION-83] Indeed,justifications of the Peterloo Massacre culminated in the judicial and ministerial fabrication of \u2018seditious assembly\u2019 as a novel concept in common law; as Michael Lobban has shown, this held that the character of a meeting, not what was said or done at it, could be sufficient to make it unlawful and its violent dispersal lawful.[CITATION-84] This further strengthened the discretionary power of Britain\u2019s magistrates against meetings, regardless of any statute in operation.The 1819 Act, passed after Peterloo and in force until 1825, revived controversies over how officials ought to judge requisitions for official meetings that would enjoy particular protections. The Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, insisted that full discretion \u2018undoubtedly belonged\u2019 to officials as to when to grant requests.[CITATION-85] By contrast, Lord Ossulton theorised that traditionally \u2018the sanction of the Sheriff was only necessary to give an authentic character to the meeting, as a meeting of the county\u2019. Under a Seditious Meetings Act, he thought, \u2018private opinions\u2019 should be set aside and officials simply assess if \u2018the requisitions are of sufficient weight and respectability\u2019 or \u2018whether such a meeting, under circumstances possible no doubt, but it is to be presumed rare, may be calculated to produce direct and manifest danger to the public peace\u2019.[CITATION-86] Such logic demonstrates how Whig criticism of the Tories often conflated the refusal to call a meeting officially with the outright prohibition of one.[CITATION-87] Objections to Crown influence over local decisions obscured how far opposition politicians broadly agreed with the Tories that while \u2018the right of meeting was a valuable part of the constitution\u2019 there were \u2018limits within which it should be confined\u2019.[CITATION-88] When Castlereagh dismissed Earl Fitzwilliam as the Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire\u2019s West Riding, George Lamb seized on this as an example of reprisal against those officials who acted \u2018against the wishes of his majesty\u2019s ministers at public meetings\u2019.[CITATION-89] While a clever partisan attack, this overstated the power, rather than influence, ministers wielded. Fitzwilliam was dismissed from his Crown appointment for signing a requisition for a county meeting to discuss the Peterloo massacre. The High Sheriff of Yorkshire, who agreed to the requisition and presided at \u2018the first county meeting which had been disgraced with all the emblems of flags and drums\u2019, remained in post after telling thousands gathered at York Castle that he had \u2018called the meeting readily as he was a friend to popular meetings\u2019. Even if the infamous dismissal demonstrated Crown influence over the Lords Lieutenant, then, numerous sheriffs, mayors, and magistrates could not be so easily replaced.[CITATION-90] Widespread agitation over George IV\u2019s efforts to divorce Queen Caroline tested the local application of the 1819 Seditious Meetings Act. In Cheshire, a \u2018pocket sheriff\u2019 faced claims that his refusal of a requisition placed him in contempt of Parliament for impairing the liberty of petitioning under the Bills of Rights.[CITATION-91] On the basis that he had already procured 9,000 signatures for a declaration favouring the king, the loyalist deputy sheriff of Hampshire rejected a requisition.[CITATION-92] In Northumberland, Sir Charles Monck published his correspondence with the sheriff, objecting to the lack of \u2018some constitutional ground for such refusal\u2019 of a requisition for a meeting. Yet, even under the provisions of the 1819 Act, office-holders were unable to impose \u2018conformity to the wishes of the Ministers of the day\u2019 by applying their own prejudices to requests. Monck\u2019s fellow Whigs in the county subsequently repurposed their requisition as a signed advertisement for their own \u2018meeting of the independent freeholders, and inhabitants\u2019. They could safely proceed on their own authority since the requisition included an array of local magnates and gentry, not just seven householders, and a number were themselves magistrates tasked with monitoring such notices.[CITATION-93] For those not so elevated as to be justices of the peace themselves, the discretion of officials had long provided obstructions and sometimes opportunities. The overlapping jurisdiction of officials allowed some requisitionists to choose the most receptive recipient. In 1810, the grand jury of Dublin and a group of 124 freemen and freeholders sent requisitions to both the High Sheriffs of the county and the city, asking them to convene a meeting to consider repeal of the Act of Union. The dual strategy was astute, since one sheriff ignored them, but the other agreed.[CITATION-94] Similarly, in 1839, the deputy constable of Clifford, in West Yorkshire, agreed to convene a meeting to remonstrate against the high level of postal charges even though the head constable had declined a requisition from local tradesmen.[CITATION-95] In some cases, requisitions and counter-requisitions engaged in a contest of signature-gathering to persuade an official to agree or to refuse to call a public meeting, as in 1809, when accusations of wartime corruption prompted Prestonians to sign rival demands to the mayor.[CITATION-96] Officials\u2019 sympathies might influence how they assayed the weight of signatures. In 1830, the sheriff of Cornwall refused to call a meeting about reform, claiming a lack of clergy or wealthy men among the 300 freeholders signing the requisition.[CITATION-97] In 1838, the bailiff of Darlington refused to call a public meeting about the repeal of the Corn Laws, arguing that \u2018the requisition was not respectably signed\u2019 as \u2018several of the requisitionists rent shops and premises in the central part of the town\u2019 but few were freeholders.[CITATION-98] By contrast, the constable of Brighton insisted that he was obliged to agree a requisition from rate-payers, regardless of whether they included \u2018the poorest or the richest men\u2019.[CITATION-99] Given the prevalence of absentee landownership in Ireland, any test of requisitionists\u2019 \u2018great property\u2019 became an excuse to refuse county meetings.[CITATION-100] As late 1839, the High Sheriff of Queens County rejected a requisition from \u2018Popish priests\u2019 on the grounds that it lacked \u2018resident landed proprietors\u2019 among the signatories.[CITATION-101] The decisions of officials, then, reflected different national and local contexts, ranging from counties down to parishes, and reflecting grander and humbler office-holders\u2019 connections to their communities.Where a meeting proceeded without an official convening it, it was subject to magisterial veto during the operation of the Seditious Meetings Act and common-law threat of violent dispersal and criminal prosecution at all times. Immediately after Peterloo, Sir Codrington Carrington, a past Chief Justice of Ceylon and the current chairman of the Buckinghamshire Quarter Sessions, published a tract denying \u2018the birth-right of the subjects of Great Britain to assemble at the requisition of any private individual\u2019. He distinguished \u2018the regulated privilege of petition\u2019 in the Bill of Rights from unlawful assemblies \u2018for the purpose of deliberating upon any alleged grievance in Church or State, unsanctioned by the concurrence or summons of the appropriate public authority, but originating in the will of any number of mere private persons\u2019.[CITATION-102] Many Tory politicians may have agreed, but legislation always permitted householders to requisition public meetings through signed advertisements, subject to the oversight of magistrates\u2014whether those like Codrington or more permissive individuals. When, in Leeds and Plymouth, the mayor refused a requisition from householders for a meeting to petition in support of Queen Caroline, it became their own signed advertisement for a meeting unmolested by the magistrates.[CITATION-103] In 1817, Lord Grenville presciently worried whether magistrates could now \u2018legalize notices, which would otherwise be illegal\u2019 by exercising their discretion not to act against a signed advertisement.[CITATION-104] The 1819 law included a clause attempting to guard against this, but formalising the notification of magistrates could sometimes assure those organising and attending meetings of their lawfulness\u2014even if a requisition had not protected the Peterloo crowd from the Riot Act.[CITATION-105] Indeed, long after the expiry of the final Seditious Meetings Act in 1825, its procedures for requisitioning shaped popular views of the constitutional standing of public assembly. In 1839, thecounselled readers that to \u2018make any public meeting legal it is only necessary that a requisition, signed by seven householders, be presented to the Mayor or Chief Constable of a Town or Borough, or to the Lord Lieutenant for a County Meeting\u2019, but then \u2018if he decline, the requisitionists may call the meeting themselves\u2019.[CITATION-106] In York, Chartists sent \u2018a numerously signed requisition of respectable tradesmen\u2019 to the Mansion House, but since the Lord Mayor was out of town\u2014perhaps not coincidentally\u2014\u2018the requisitionists were compelled to call the meeting\u2019 outside the Albion Hotel themselves.[CITATION-107] If this trick played on the Government\u2019s \u2018scrupulous anxiety to keep within the Law in dealing with Chartism\u2019, it should not be mistaken as \u2018a misunderstanding\u2019 of that law, as F.C. Mather suggests.[CITATION-108] Rather, Chartists identified ways to tame the threat of repression by local magistrates, whether by assuaging anxieties or delegitimising any reaction.[CITATION-109] The formula permitted some meetings to proceed even after the royal proclamation of 1839 encouraged magistrates to prevent revolutionary threats.[CITATION-110] In Northallerton, one justice declined a requisition to convene a meeting himself but gave the Chartists his blessing to proceed, \u2018wishing the speakers only not to use inflammatory language\u2019.[CITATION-111] Where local magistrates did forbid an advertised public meeting from proceeding, organisers could evade their jurisdiction in remote moors and open fields, even if this involved serious hikes for the audience and scheduling for weekends or holidays rather than workday evenings.[CITATION-112] Hence, in 1840, the Chartists of Stockton-upon-Tees assembled at Thornaby Green, two miles outside the bounds of their town, after the mayor not only refused to call a meeting in compliance with a requisition \u2018signed by the number of inhabitant householders specified by Act of Parliament\u2019 but also threatened to set the special constables upon them.[CITATION-113] In emphasising the contingency of local repression and subversive uses for the law, we should not ignore the physical peril for attendees of more radical public meetings. Inconsistent or tardy responses from local officials could create rather than remove physical and legal jeopardy, as two examples from Newcastle-upon-Tyne demonstrate. In 1819, the mayor declined a requisition from 300 inhabitants to convene a meeting about Peterloo, but \u2018gave permission to proceed with the meeting, which he promised not to molest\u2019 as he trusted \u2018the good sense and prudence of the people\u2019. The reformers subsequently offered him a vote of thanks, but the mayor \u2018caught the contagion of fear\u2019 in the following days and turned against a brewing \u2018rebellion\u2019, resulting in violent clashes.[CITATION-114] Twenty years later, the town\u2019s magistrates responded to a riot by forbidding all public meetings. The town\u2019s Chartists therefore submitted a requisition to the mayor for permission to meet at the end of the month to deliberate over sending an address to the Queen against a standing army and the proposed rural police bill. John Fife, the mayor and an active member of the Northern Political Union just a few years earlier, did not respond until the last moment\u2014and then with his refusal. Attendees gathered at the public grounds known as the Forth, but local officials read the Riot Act and deployed armed troops and constables to disperse the outraged crowd. While no one died, a generation would remember that the 1839 \u2018Battle of the Forth was the Peterloo of Newcastle\u2019 and R.C. Gammage quickly accused Fife of trying \u2018to strike a blow at the right of public meeting\u2019.[CITATION-115] As both these examples demonstrate\u2014in periods outside any Seditious Meetings Act\u2014indecision and bad faith by local officials remained a threat to, as well as an opportunity for, those requisitioning and attending public meetings.[CITATION-116] Since magistrates retained arbitrary discretion in declaring assemblies riotous or seditious, they could threaten violence or prosecution obliquely with well-timed reminders in response to the open advertisement of public meetings. William Cobbett suspected many attendees chose not to attend his petition meeting at Portsdown Hill, Hampshire, after this happened in February 1817.[CITATION-117] Huddersfield\u2019s magistrates, \u2018not content with throwing every legal and constitutional obstacle in the way of the requisitions\u2019 for public meetings in 1839, offered \u2018a little intimidation\u2019 in vague but menacing posters around the town.[CITATION-118] The authorities could also use the names on a requisition or signed advertisement to persecute organisers and supporters.[CITATION-119] In Yorkshire, \u2018the Court party\u2019 formed a \u2018Gag Committee\u2019 that scuppered an 1817 meeting on reform by persuading sufficient of the eighty signatories to withdraw their names from a requisition to the sheriff.[CITATION-120] The constables of Barnsley accepted a Chartist requisition for consideration but then retained it, apparently with an eye to arresting the signatories or at least threatening to do so.[CITATION-121] At a Halifax public meeting to condemn the Peterloo massacre, the reported crowd of 40,000 stampeded in panic at false rumours that the constables\u2014whose refusal had led to the gathering being convened by the requisitionists\u2014had come to attack it; only assurance of the presence of a sympathetic magistrate allayed the panic.[CITATION-122] Where audiences risked their own personal safety, however, their sheer numbers created a material challenge to dispersal. As a speaker told Rochdale\u2019s Chartists in the summer of 1839, \u2018[t]he Government cannot commit a million and a half men to prison, but they can pick them out here and there, and thus terrify the whole\u2019.[CITATION-123] For this reason, the cumulative choices of meeting attendees constrained the limits of repression, in practice.Ultimately, the protective value of requisitions faded in the face of the common law doctrine of \u2018seditious assembly\u2019, as judges pointed to the scale and perception of meetings, rather than the likely or actual conduct, as determining their legality. In Ireland, Daniel O\u2019Connell faced prosecution in 1842 for the \u2018intimidation intended to be excited\u2019 by the sheer numbers his repeal meetings attracted. Prosecuting Chartists at the Lancashire assizes in 1842, Lord Abinger told the grand jury that meetings attended by \u2018such multitudes as to render all notion of serious debate impossible\u2019 must be intrinsically riotous. Judged against the traditions of deliberative town and county meetings, \u2018assemblies of such magnitude, without a president, or any one empowered and able to restrain and dissolve them, must lead, as every one will see, to alarm and terror, and to the disturbance of the peace\u2019.[CITATION-124] The shift away from official procedure to elite anxiety as a determinant of legality took time to disseminate; later that year, the magistrate\u2019s periodicalanswered a reader\u2019s query about Chartist meetings with the advice that \u2018as long as they conduct themselves peacefully, and use no seditious or inflammatory language, they cannot be legally molested\u2019.[CITATION-125] However, the Home Secretary, Sir George Grey, supported the Metropolitan Police in judging that the procession of the Chartists\u2019 great petition from Kennington Common to Westminster in 1848 was \u2018calculated to inspire just terror and alarm\u2019.[CITATION-126] An 1848 guide for magistrates disseminated this principle of seditious assembly even more widely, shifting further away from the earlier Acts\u2019 emphasis on due notification and advertisement.[CITATION-127] In these ways, the magisterial right of veto gained a more expansive application, since the procedure of requisition had ceased to provide elite control over public meetings. When the threshold for seditious assembly receded along with fears of revolution after 1848 in Great Britain, access to public space became a new frontier for struggles over popular assembly.[CITATION-128] Did the spread of requisitioning strengthen popular claims or state repression, then? Opportunism led political elites to welcome \u2018a general run of addresses\u2019 from their grass-roots supporters when these might be \u2018of great service\u2019 to their cause, fuelling conflicts over the authority of local meetings and so stimulating written requisitions to validate them.[CITATION-129] In 1784, Edmund Burke loftily warned against \u2018a double House of Commons\u2019, with the executive playing off expressions of opinion \u2018in corporation and county meetings dispersed\u2019 against the lawful deliberations of elected members \u2018in Parliament assembled\u2019. While he and other Rockingham Whigs now condemned an outpouring of Tory addresses, they had helped requisition meetings for Wyvill\u2019s reform petitions just a few years earlier.[CITATION-130] In the 1790s, Pittite office-holders might issue or grant requisitions for county or town meetings as part of the \u2018vulgar\u2019 loyalism of defending the king and the constitution.[CITATION-131] When in 1821 the duke of Wellington condemned \u2018the farce of a county meeting\u2019, he recognised theand clarified that his remark referred only to a specific rejection of a requisition in Hampshire, where he was Lord Lieutenant, and that public meetings \u2018if properly regulated, were a fair constitutional mode of taking the sense of the county\u2019.[CITATION-132] Successive special laws for Ireland, a reliance on outsider stipendiary magistrates, and the central military authority commanded from Dublin Castle contrasted with a greater respect for local initiative in Great Britain. There, ministers relied on laws or proclamations to embolden local office-holders\u2019 discretion and magistrates\u2019 enforcement.[CITATION-133] The development of new police forces and stipendiary magistrates did not displace this reliance on the amateur administration of justice, largely thanks to the parsimony of rate-payers.[CITATION-134] While repressive legislation had sought to control novel waves of mass meetings that had left peace officers uncertain, it also codified specific practices that could be adapted and subverted. During the fevered crisis of 1831\u201332, freeholders and liberal magistrates requisitioned the sheriff of Warwickshire to call a county meeting that subsequently condemned the reactionary magistrates and mayor of Warwick, who were responsible for heavy-handed policing.[CITATION-135] The political sympathies and transient fears of local elites shaped how they applied the law to people and events, establishing new traditions. During the Queen Caroline agitation, Birmingham\u2019s Tories had circumvented George Muntz, the High Bailiff, in order to requisition their own town meeting in favour of the king\u2019s divorce. More than a decade later, Muntz enjoyed reading aloud the same names from a protest denigrating a reform meeting not convened by the current office-holders.[CITATION-136] If the liberality and tyranny of particular justices and officials might ebb and flow across Great Britain, new precedents provided high-water marks in subsequent disputes with office-holders.[CITATION-137] The next section shows why so many skirmishes would be fought over the signatures on requisitions.Organising, submitting, and contesting requisitions was just one of the ways in which local \u2018political entrepreneurs\u2019 turned high political issues into truly nation-wide controversies. Like petitions, protests, and other representations of popular opinion, meetings constructed expressions of support as much as revealing some pre-existing balance of sentiments.[CITATION-138] This section considers how requisitioning shaped the organisation, advertisement, attendance, and conduct of meetings, revealing rival claims to represent a community. The representative claim of a meeting began with the signatures on a requisition, which was likely to be reproduced and publicised in an advertisement for a meeting, whether approved by an official or proceeding on the initiative of the requisitionists alone.[CITATION-139] Appealing to both the quantity and quality of support they enjoyed, requisitions often employed a stock boast, also common for petitions, of being \u2018numerously and respectably signed\u2019.[CITATION-140] In fact, over time, inflationary expectations or organisational incentives boosted the number of names attached to requisitions.[CITATION-141] Some grew so large that they became preliminary drafts of a mass petition; in 1820, 100 \u2018respectable citizens\u2019 in Edinburgh and 300 Glaswegians each signed requisitions for anti-ministerial meetings.[CITATION-142] Like other sorts of subscriptional address, the initial audience for each signature on a requisition would be the next person invited to add their name.[CITATION-143] Then, whatever officials and magistrates made of the signatories, their names\u2014often printed on advertisements or read aloud at meetings\u2014might repel or attract the potential audience.[CITATION-144] When Wyvill sought more than 200 Yorkshire freeholders to sign his 1779 requisition for a county meeting on reform, he exercised care to exclude parliamentarians whose support might indicate partisanship. He did, however, secure the support of York\u2019s Dean, whose name could signal to clergy that they too might defy their archbishop\u2019s disapproval of reform.[CITATION-145] By contrast, critics could point out a narrow base of support. During the Reform bill crisis, Lord Wharncliffe recognised that the \u2018gentlemen who had put their names to this requisition were old Parliamentary Reformers\u2019 and hence cast doubt on whether a Yorkshire county meeting and its petition really spoke for \u2018the great body of the freeholders\u2019.[CITATION-146] Canny organisers, in this way, might search for unexpected signatories and aim for a broad church of support in order to prove the significance of their meeting and any resolutions or petitions it might produce.[CITATION-147] Hence, in 1839, the Whig parliamentary agent for Fife recruited local Chartists to join the requisition for a meeting in Markinch\u2019s Apron Society Hall, signalling a popular front to praise Victoria\u2019s defiance of the Tories during the bedchamber crisis.[CITATION-148] Those designing and signing a requisition often assumed a wider set of responsibilities for the meeting too.[CITATION-149] A letter of 1825 from one anti-slavery veteran to a new local committee explained how they should meet privately \u2018for the purpose of drawing up a requisition, framing resolutions of a petition, & arranging the business & settling the part each individual shall take, in a public meeting\u2019.[CITATION-150] Beyond choreography for resultant gatherings, requisitionists might also function as delegated organisers; the resolutions of a meeting commonly delegated the signatories of the requisition to form a committee to co-ordinate the collection of signatures for a petition or address. In 1815 William Cobbett found 581 other freeholders to support his requisition to the High Sheriff of Hampshire for a county meeting, and he hinted at one reason for assembling so many names when he encouraged \u2018one Gentleman from every town, and every considerable village\u2019 to attend, so that \u2018the work of signing Petitions might be very easily and speedily accomplished\u2019 afterwards.[CITATION-151] On a similar model, the Catholic Association treated the requisitionists of local meetings in 1829 as the delegated organisers of the petitioning effort in each part of Ireland.[CITATION-152] Peel\u2019s ministry expressed particular concern over the role that Catholic priests played in requisitioning the meeting of 1843 in Clontarf, as it signalled a wider role for clerical organising in the repeal agitation.[CITATION-153] Whether they signed an original document or approved the use of their name on the advertisement, requisitionists would generally be expected to attend and perhaps to speak at a subsequent public meeting. If absent, well-known figures might send letters to be read on their behalf, excusing their indisposition and endorsing an outcome for the meeting.[CITATION-154] Mass absenteeism could be embarrassing, however. Some organisers resented that \u2018people seemed to fancy they had only to give their names to a public measure, and then all their duty was done\u2019, while critics pointed to poor turnouts as proof that a requisition\u2019s \u2018signatures were obtained of tradesmen and others\u2019 obliged to \u2018their patrons\u2019 but not committed to the cause.[CITATION-155] In 1839, the Provost of Maxwelltown tried to delay starting a meeting on the Corn Laws until the requisitionists had all arrived. While he may have hoped to alter the balance of forces attending the meeting, he drew complaints that working men could not waste time waiting, with the Chartist Thomas Johnston asking: \u2018[a]re the men of Maxwelltown dogs, that they should come crouching when you and your brother rulers choose to whistle on them?\u2019[CITATION-156] In such cases, poor turnout on the part of the requisitionists undermined any advantage from securing a friendly official in the chair.A male householder adding his name to a requisition made a public claim on the time and attention of his peers and associated himself with its purpose; like the polling of votes in elections, this was a public act. When, in 1833, an anonymous \u2018Rate Payer\u2019 in Morley signed placards calling a public meeting on church rates, fellow inhabitants assembled instead to denounce \u2018so cowardly a system\u2019 in this \u2018unusual manner adopted of calling public meetings\u2019.[CITATION-157] However, those \u2018more humble in their origins\u2019 who wished to initiate meetings could openly challenge propertied signatories\u2019 aloofness in not requisitioning meetings of concern to their community.[CITATION-158] At an 1837 meeting against the new poor law in Dewsbury, one speaker was \u2018angry that the shopkeepers have shrunk from this meeting\u2019 and \u2018that a sufficient number of them could not be found to sign a requisition\u2019 for official sanction. In the wake of the Reform Act, this was a further example of privileges that \u2018they appear desirous of keeping them to themselves\u2019.[CITATION-159] By contrast, the following year, when Earl Fitzwilliam claimed that the workers of the West Riding had come to embrace the benefits of the poor law, Richard Oastler theatrically suggested that he sign a requisition to the Lord Lieutenant for a county meeting on the question. This was not just a pointed allusion to Fitzwilliam\u2019s dismissal from that office twenty years earlier; it was a clever subversion of leading property-holders\u2019 traditional prerogatives, challenging his reluctance to test workers\u2019 opinions openly.[CITATION-160] Traditionally, organisers had limited powers to procure predetermined decisions as the very authority of a town or county meeting depended on its claim to open deliberation of the matters identified in a requisition.[CITATION-161] This often allowed enemies to hijack an official meeting, subverting the intended outcome. In 1800, Viscount Castlereagh and John Beresford conspired to demonstrate popular support for the proposed Anglo-Irish Union, hoping for \u2018counter-petitions\u2019 in the face of \u2018a great run of petitions against\u2019. They expected the opposition to request a meeting in Donegal, and Castlereagh judged that \u2018the sheriffs calling it at their instance would be most for our advantage\u2019 as he hoped to send allies to \u2018turn the tables upon them and vote an address in favour\u2019. This \u2018would have an excellent effect\u2014as we don\u2019t call the meeting, we lose nothing if it fails\u2019, Castlereagh observed, providing a glimpse of the private calculations behind requisitioning and ambushes of this kind.[CITATION-162] When Dewsbury\u2019s constable refused to permit amendments during a meeting called to celebrate the Queen\u2019s coronation, radicals on the parish vestry challenged his claims for expenses in publicising the meeting; his conduct converted \u2018a \u201c\u201d into a \u201c\u201d\u2019, they argued, meaning that he should carry the advertising costs himself.[CITATION-163] At the same time, chairs and organisers could deflect hostile audiences by insisting that a meeting stuck to its requisitioned purpose, beyond which it stretched its mandate or even its legality.[CITATION-164] Hence, in 1797, the sheriff of County Antrim prevented any debate on Catholic Emancipation and parliamentary reform, \u2018not because he personally objected to it, but because it did not make part of the business mentioned in the requisition\u2019 to convene the meeting.[CITATION-165] Meetings convened for constitutional purposes as cover for subversive ones had been a target of legislation from the old law against Tumultuous Petitioning down to the Seditious Meetings Acts. Southwark\u2019s High Bailiff elicited \u2018loud hissing\u2019 when he reminded a meeting of Queen Caroline\u2019s sympathisers of this, alluding to \u2018many severe restrictions against digressing from the particular subject of a requisition\u2019.[CITATION-166] Of course, what constituted digression from the substance of a requisition was itself a question of political judgement. In both 1821 and 1822 partisans requisitioned county meetings in Devon to petition about agricultural distress; on each occasion, the intentional inclusion or exclusion of \u2018the \u201cold Bugbear, Parliamentary reform\u201d\u2019 became a point of discord, as partisans differed on its relevance or irrelevance to their economic situation.[CITATION-167] For decades to come, reformers could connect parliamentary representation to myriad other complaints. In January 1839, the mayor of Leeds agreed to a requisition from the great and the good for an anti-Corn Law meeting at the Court House. Feargus O\u2019Connor successfully amended the resolutions to favour universal male suffrage.[CITATION-168] Perhaps the most skilful manipulation of a meeting embellished, rather than reversed, the requisition\u2019s stated purpose. At a County Dublin meeting in January 1823 in Kilmainham, Daniel O\u2019Connell gleefully adopted loyalist garb in condemning the Orange Order\u2019s \u2018conspiracy\u2019 against the Lord Lieutenant. Since the requisition suggested a loyal address wishing for the viceroy\u2019s recovery from an assassination attempt, he argued that condemnation of protestant violence was wholly within the purview of the meeting.[CITATION-169] Derby\u2019s Chartists, at a town meeting to launch a congratulatory address to the Queen on the birth of her first child in 1842, sought to amend the loyal address to highlight the sufferings of working-class women in childbirth.[CITATION-170] Local supporters of larger causes, then, exploited the practices designed to limit, control, and direct the organisation of public meetings, whether by submitting their own requisitions, by recruiting signatories to expand support, or by ambushing opponents, either physically or procedurally.The representative claims of a public meeting would also be tested against the timely and open notice of it. When the tame sheriff of County Down refused a requisition from critics of the Anglo-Irish Union in 1800, the lack of \u2018public meetings of which due and legal notice had been given\u2019 provided easy ammunition to mock \u2018surreptitious addresses\u2019, such as that emerging from a grand jury he had stacked.[CITATION-171] Equally, those \u2018quietly\u2019 circulating requisitions for a public meeting would be hoping to select the audience too.[CITATION-172] In 1822, Henry Hunt mocked the sheriff of Somerset for printing the requisition for a county meeting only \u2018in ancorner of an\u2019, identifying a deliberate Whig plan to gather for a \u2018nice, snug humbug of their own\u2019.[CITATION-173] In 1839 Gateshead\u2019s radicals mocked this sort of \u2018hole and corner meeting\u2019, which might not be announced \u2018til the afternoon\u2019 when only \u2018a few placards\u2019 conveyed that the mayor had accepted \u2018a requisition got up by the Whigs\u2019 in favour of impressment of seamen and tax cuts for shipowners.[CITATION-174] In some cases, critics could help advertise a requisitioned meeting they suspected of deliberately limited publicity. After the mayor of Newcastle granted a \u2018most numerously and respectably signed\u2019 requisition from advocates of Catholic emancipation in 1829, those fearing \u2018the utter subversion of the Constitution of 1688\u2019 printed notices warning protestants to \u2018attend and by your votes preserve the blessings so dearly purchased by your Ancestors\u2019.[CITATION-175] Most spectacularly, Manchester\u2019s borough reeve went so far as to cancel a 1812 public meeting in the Exchange Hall after unauthorised advertisements promoted mass attendance in order to prevent any misrepresentation of the town\u2019s views by the loyalists requisitioning the meeting; crowds assembled outside anyway, leading to a riot in which the building was ransacked.[CITATION-176] Where meetings proceeded on private initiative rather than accepted requisition, organisers \u2018were thrown upon their own resources\u2019 in organising a venue and advertising.[CITATION-177] Local printers and bellmen might refuse commissions to publicise meetings where they feared magisterial or social repercussions for doing so.[CITATION-178] In the decades after the Napoleonic Wars, a proliferation of civic buildings offered the chance to requisition a symbol of community authority as well as cover from inclement weather.[CITATION-179] For this reason, as much as office-holders\u2019 presidency and the official status it provided, requisitions increasingly sought permission to use these spaces. Bath\u2019s Council refused the use of the town hall for a Chartist women\u2019s meeting in 1838, despite protests that \u2018the Requisition requesting the use of the Hall was more numerously and respectably signed than any former requisition to the same\u2019.[CITATION-180] By contrast, Chartists in Nottingham secured the use of their town hall, even if the mayor declined to chair their meetings.[CITATION-181] Just as the largest mass meetings assembled on moors and fields beyond the jurisdiction of hostile authorities, the refusal of access to local buildings might lead organisers to advertise their meeting in an urban open space, such as a marketplace, furthering the association of radicalism with the open air.[CITATION-182] That association also rested on the fact that such meetings, \u2018by being held in the open air, would naturally contain loose and suspicious individuals\u2019. Even before rioting began, the Spa Fields meetings of 1816 appeared transgressive since, as one whiggish detractor noted, the radicals\u2019 placards summoned \u2018exclusively\u2019 the \u2018lower order of the people\u2019 from adjacent London parishes. The resolutions addressed \u2018our fellow-countrymen\u2019 of \u2018every City, Town, and populous place in the United Kingdom\u2019, who were\u2014in the style of a requisition\u2014\u2018hereby invited, and requested by this Meeting to assemble and meet on theday, at the same hour, and for the SAME PURPOSE\u2019 of petitioning for reform themselves.[CITATION-183] As a conservative essayist complained in 1820, \u2018the modern method of calling together large deliberative crowds, as a sort of\u2019, producing resolutions \u2018as authorized expressions of popular opinion\u2019, would, \u2018to our ancestors, have been unintelligible\u2019. While the Seditious Meetings Act could encourage magisterial reaction against mass meetings of this kind, limiting \u2018in some degree the right of voluntary meetings\u2019,[CITATION-184] it did little to arrest a tremulous transition across our period from county communities of magnates and gentry, or urban oligarchies, to public meetings of inhabitants more generally.[CITATION-185] This can be seen in the shifting expectations of who might participate in public meetings called by requisition. The increasingly frequent calls for general meetings of a county assembled large numbers of freeholders, whose property also qualified them to vote in elections of shire MPs.[CITATION-186] While they were denied speaking and voting rights, women and unpropertied men certainly attended county meetings in the 1790s and might be acknowledged as subscribers to funds launched there.[CITATION-187] Since presence did not permit full participation, however, some requisitionists sought to broaden the invitation to a meeting.[CITATION-188] In 1795, the sheriff of Bedfordshire accepted a requisition organised by the duke of Bedford for a county meeting about the proposed Gagging Acts, but in his consequent advertisement replaced the word \u2018inhabitants\u2019 with the more traditional \u2018freeholders\u2019. When the sheriff tried to restrict participation on the day, the gathering split into rival county meetings, denounced by each other as \u2018certain of the inhabitants\u2019 and a \u2018promiscuous assembly\u2019 that \u2018took possession of the town-hall\u2019. The duke defended his broader invitation on the basis that the meeting resolved to send a petition to which \u2018the signature of the poorest individual, who was capable of forming a judgement on the measure, was as respectable as that of the proudest merchant, or the richest banker\u2019.[CITATION-189] Since, for centuries, petitions had sometimes included \u2018inhabitants\u2019, growing numbers of initiatory petitions from public meetings might justify broader invitations.[CITATION-190] Yet the sheriff of Staffordshire, when faced with a similar challenge in 1797, offered the traditional view \u2018that a voice at a County Meeting belongs exclusively to Freeholders, and that to summon the Manufacturers and Inhabitants would be an encroachment on the privileges of the Freeholders\u2019.[CITATION-191] After the Napoleonic Wars, T.B.H. Oldfield complained that \u2018it has been customary for the Sheriff to summon only the freeholders\u2019 to county meetings, \u2018as if every other description of persons, because they are deprived of the right of voting, should be deprived of the right of petitioning also\u2019. As a leading polemicist for parliamentary reform, he recognised a parallel challenge to the representative claims of property.[CITATION-192] Indeed, after the Napoleonic Wars, one editor warned that \u2018including in the Requisitions for County Meetings the mass of the inhabitants was pregnant with dangerous consequences\u2019 precisely because \u2018the Freeholders must be a minority\u2019 and so the sober judgement of property overwhelmed.[CITATION-193] By 1821, official meetings faced challenge as \u2018unjustifiably exclusive\u2019 if they were not open to all inhabitants rather than just freeholders or, in towns, householders. However, the success of challenges turned on local tests of strength, and we should be cautious in affirming \u2018the participation of all inhabitants of the community, irrespective of their gender, or their status\u2019.[CITATION-194] Regardless of how a requisition framed the invitation, one radical in 1808 noted \u2018the inconvenience, trouble, and loss of time to which the middle classes of the people are subject in their attendance\u2019.[CITATION-195] This was as nothing to Thomas Cooper\u2019s recollections that the working pressures of \u2018employment that I might have bread, prevented me from feeling much curiosity about public meetings\u2019 in his early life before the 1840s.[CITATION-196] Where wider numbers of inhabitants did attend, officials struggled to enforce any restrictions of rank and geography they wished to impose. The geographical limits of residence could be tricky to delineate, especially where urban communities abutted. Hence, the mayor of Dudley was challenged \u2018Is not this a Public Meeting?\u2019 when he tried to insist in 1819 that the requisition\u2019s invitation to inhabitants of \u2018the Town and Neighbourhood\u2019 did not extend so far as Birmingham.[CITATION-197] To defend local control, the 1817 and 1819 Seditious Meetings Acts penalised illicit attendance at official meetings and restricted any meeting called on the initiative of householders to the locals of a single parish; however, it did not restrict the classes of property and people invited, even if this presumably informed magisterial prejudices in exercising their powers of veto.[CITATION-198] In practice, growing numbers of propertied men might not recognise each other, and meetings presented few opportunities to validate a man\u2019s qualifications of property or residence. When more than 2,000 men attended a Devon County meeting about reform in 1821, it did not allow for the sorts of scrutiny common to contested elections polled over multiple days.[CITATION-199] This left the audiences for any meeting\u2014who was invited and who actually attended\u2014contingent on local debates over where the boundaries should be drawn and trespassers detected.[CITATION-200] As for female participation in official meetings, Kathryn Gleadle\u2019s characterisation of women as \u2018borderline citizens\u2019 captures participation that remained contingent on context and open to challenge.[CITATION-201] Meetings convened on the requisitionists\u2019 own initiative could invite women to speak or at least have their words read by male orators.[CITATION-202] When, in 1832, Eliza Macauley \u2018deprecated the custom which prevented women from taking part in the public proceedings\u2019, she did so from the platform of a gathering of stakeholders in Robert Owen\u2019s new labour exchange, which resembled a commercial as much as political meeting.[CITATION-203] Women enjoyed greater opportunities to speak and vote in the meetings of parish vestries than in county or town meetings.[CITATION-204] The Queen Caroline controversy, where women\u2019s gender established their interest in her plight, provides evidence of \u2018Ladies\u2019 not only signing their own petitions and addresses but also attending public meetings.[CITATION-205] However, the descriptions of the detached, seated areas for \u2018Married Ladies\u2019 at various London parish gatherings suggest that they would have observed, rather than participated in, any deliberations. It was an exceptional moment when, in Leeds, \u2018the ladies were called to hold up their hands\u2019 to approve the text of a female address after men had affirmed the main resolutions of a meeting.[CITATION-206] The presence of women in the audience of a Norfolk county meeting regarding slavery, in 1825, is only recorded because controversy erupted over whether the speeches provided too much detail of the abuse of the enslaved.[CITATION-207] In 1830, the mayor of York agreed a requisition for an anti-slavery meeting where women vastly outnumbered men in the audience but did not speak.[CITATION-208] The monster meetings of the post-war mass platform and Chartism might have allowed women to take part in votes on resolutions in ways official meetings did not.[CITATION-209] By the 1830s, the campaigns against the New Poor Law and for the Charter did organise \u2018public meetings\u2019 of women as separate events with female chairs and speakers, perhaps following requisitions seeking access to a public building.[CITATION-210] However, \u2018public meetings of ladies\u2019, specifically, remained rare and often confined to specific charitable causes into the 1840s. This reflected the extension of the term \u2018public meeting\u2019 as much as women\u2019s entry into the traditional assemblies of propertied men.[CITATION-211] Expectations of broader participation gradually blended the declarative and deliberative gatherings of a locality with the rallies, lectures, and \u2018public meetings\u2019 of interested stakeholders and voluntary associations.[CITATION-212] Thomas Attwood tried to launch his Political Union for parliamentary reform with a requisition signed by hundreds of Birmingham\u2019s inhabitants in 1830; when the High Bailiff refused on the grounds of the impropriety of calling a municipal meeting to form a pressure group, the requisitionists convened one in their own names.[CITATION-213] If this sought to add civic authority to a membership organisation, not all associations welcomed the deliberative procedures expected for community gathering. An 1827 Liverpool \u2018public meeting\u2019 of \u2018friends\u2019 of the Irish Sunday School Society was \u2018public\u2019 in accessibility and advertisement while denying critics the right to speak or amend its resolutions.[CITATION-214] In 1832, Mancunians argued over the alleged \u2018pretence of a public meeting\u2019 by protestant critics of the Irish National Schools, given that the event was \u2018publicly convened, with the boroughreeve announced as the chairman\u2019 and yet sold tickets to control a \u2018packed meeting\u2019.[CITATION-215] The introduction of ticketing in these cases reflected the hybridisation of \u2018public meetings\u2019, asserting representative claims for an association that might have previously met privately. The growing use of partisan meetings in the 1830s, with pre-determined resolutions even when open to popular attendance, was more an admission of defeat in defending the propertied privileges of official meetings than the \u2018closure\u2019 of a genuinely democratic tradition. The many local incidents where one group quit a meeting they proved unable to carry were writ large in the diminished salience of official meetings and requisitions. A profusion and fragmentation of public meetings saw more gatherings claim to represent a community, with hybrid forms of \u2018public meetings\u2019 providing different but not necessarily greater constraints on popular politics.[CITATION-216] This article has revealed the strange career of requisitioning for public meetings, emphasising in particular the role of local officials and magistrates in controlling public meetings; the hybridisation of the types of meetings assembled; and the initiative and skill of organisers in appropriating and subverting practices governed by requisitioning. As regards the first of these, conflicts over who could call public meetings, for whom, and about what, reveal the potentially porous boundaries of the political nation. Legal or violent reactions by local office-holders and magistrates could assist government repression, as Peterloo bloodily demonstrated. However, this reliance on local elites was combined with a deference to householders\u2019 privileges in the successive Seditious Meetings Acts; while emboldening the suppression of each new wave of mass gatherings in periods of revolutionary fear, the legislation paved a route to requisitioning public meetings where magisterial discretion relaxed. In Great Britain, state repression relied on local officials applying their powers to particular meetings according to their own personal prejudices and current anxieties; in Ireland, emergency legislation and central control from Dublin Castle created a very different political culture.[CITATION-217] In both cases, the judicial fabrication in the 1840s of \u2018seditious assembly\u2019 was the logical conclusion of discretionary judgement. If this arrested the increase in the scale of mass meetings, as well as discrediting requisitions as any measure of a meeting\u2019s legality, it could not reverse the variegated pattern of public meetings, now called in greater numbers by and for a broader range of people. By contrast, in the colonies of the British Empire, officials, judges, and laws discriminated among territories and peoples to provide even starker distinctions between legitimate gatherings and \u2018seditious\u2019 meetings.[CITATION-218] Although just one among a wide range of practices, requisitioning also illuminates some shifting patterns in the mobilisation of \u2018public\u2019 opinion over the. From 1780, written public requisitions seem to have spread as a means to demand or authenticate meetings that would offer resolutions or petitions on behalf of a place. If this initiated more discussion, resolutions, and petitions on public controversies, the requisition of official meetings still privileged the authority of propertied men. Craig Calhoun and James Vernon have argued, respectively, that \u2018[t]he bourgeois public sphere of the early nineteenth century marked a continued opening of aristocratic politics to members of the middle classes, but also a new exclusion of more plebeian and radical voices\u2019 constituting \u2018the closure of democratic political forms\u2019.[CITATION-219] In the case of public meetings, the exclusion and closure was only as novel as the innovative patterns of popular assembly that claimed constitutional traditions for new audiences and new purposes. As we have seen, efforts to exclude \u2018inhabitants\u2019 from county meetings sought to defend the \u2018demos\u2019 of freeholders as the numbers of general meetings proliferated. At other meetings, the closing down of unticketed admission and open deliberation reflected the proliferation, extension, and adaptation of what purported to be \u2018public meetings\u2019. These restrictions to meetings largely sought to defend traditional exclusions in novel contexts and amid claims for lawful, orderly public assembly, even if radicals cannily cast them as subversions of tradition.Finally, the practice of requisitioning public meetings elucidates the relationship between local and national initiatives. The meaning of the law and the constitution rested on creative argument and practical applications by local officials, agitators, and audiences; skirmishes over the local borderlines of political communities slowly accumulated into visions of a political nation. Rather than await parliamentary authorisation of expansion of the franchise, local initiatives helped dispel certain qualifications of property and assemble a broader community of inhabitants.[CITATION-220] As Benjamin Flowers noted in 1808, \u2018[e]very one in the least acquainted with the nature of popular meetings, convened for the consideration of public grievances, must be sensible of the exertions necessary to procure such meetings\u2019.[CITATION-221] The skills of local leaders fabricated and materialised \u2018public opinion\u2019 in the numbers assembled at meetings or in signatures to requisitions and petitions. Even if encouraged by co-ordinated national campaigns, their cumulative energies and the responsivity of grass-roots audiences determined the fate of national mobilisations. As requisitions rose and declined as part of broader transformations in popular politics, they demonstrated the ways in which formalised structures could provide a framework for, as much as a barricade against, local challenges as to who represented a community."

    "text": "This essay uses an unexploited liturgical source, a twelfth-century order book by the Milanese cleric Beroldo, to illuminate how processions shaped the practice of the largest and most radical popular movement of the central Middle Ages, the Pataria of Milan, during a pivotal moment of urban change. Religious processions had the power to project episcopal authority across a rapidly expanding urban population. They also sanctioned the redistribution of wealth and resources to city churches. At the same time, they provided a possible grammar of resistance to those who rose up against urban elites. The Pataria struggled at the pulpit and on the streets for the sexual and economic purity of the clergy. It first erupted in the city on 10 May 1057\u2014during a liturgical parade. The conflict between supporters of religious reform on the one hand, and the archbishop\u2019s aristocratic court and clergy on the other, persisted until the movement\u2019s defeat in 1075. Until then, Patarine violence continually disrupted liturgical time, tearing priests from their altars and overturning solemn processions.The article introduces Beroldo and other Milanese liturgical sources in context, and their value as witnesses to later eleventh-century history. It surveys how episcopal processions responded to urban expansion and developed a growing but unstable social and political importance. With a picture of the urban and liturgical landscape in place, it then investigates how Patarine violence contested the ways that processions, on days such as Easter baptism or the Three Day Litanies, created civic community and communicated relations of power.Riding a horse in imitation of the triumphant Christ, leading a people in lamentation around their city walls, affecting the garb of a king on Easter Saturday: the eleventh-century archbishop and ruler of Milan cast himself in the central role of a ritual theatre richer than almost any other in the Christian world. Only Rome and Constantinople could boast a more complex ceremonial life.[CITATION-1] Milan\u2019s citizens performed in and witnessed church processions which unceasingly marked the turning of time across a city in the midst of frenetic transformation. These performances had the power to project the authority of the archbishop\u2019s government across a rapidly expanding and increasingly fragmented population. They also sanctioned the redistribution of wealth and resources to city churches. At the same time, they provided a possible grammar of resistance for those who rose up against the city\u2019s elites.This essay uses an unexploited liturgical source, a twelfth-century order book by the Milanese cleric Beroldo, to illuminate the logic and behaviour of the largest and most radical popular movement in Europe during the central Middle Ages, the Pataria of Milan, during a pivotal moment of urban change. The Pataria fought in the pulpit and on the streets for the sexual and economic purity of the clergy. It had roots in Milan\u2019s rural hinterland, but first erupted in the city\u2014during a liturgical parade.[CITATION-2] Stirred up by the preaching of two charismatic clerics against married priests, on 10 May 1057 crowds of women and laymen turned a candlelit procession for the local saint Nazaro into a riot of anti-clerical violence.[CITATION-3] The conflict between radical supporters of religious reform on the one hand, and the archbishop and his aristocratic court and clergy on the other, continued until the Patarines\u2019 decisive defeat in 1075. Before then, Patarine violence provided a recurring counterpoint to the beat of liturgical time, tearing priests from their altars, overturning solemn processions, treading holy oil into the ground.The historian R.I. Moore has pointed to the Pataria as a watershed moment of radical social change in European history. For the first time in Latin Europe since Antiquity, the eleventh century saw a newly populous and mobile urban world which made mass, collective activism by non-elites possible.[CITATION-4] Nowhere was this truer than in Milan, the region\u2019s fastest-growing city. In an important recent article, Shane Bobrycki acknowledges this turning point, while reminding us that medieval rule before 1000 depended on the stability of regular popular assemblies for legitimacy and income. If such early medieval crowds rarely confronted elites openly on the street, their popular \u2018misdirection\u2019, in assemblies outside regulated boundaries in times and space, threatened to subvert the reproduction of elite power.[CITATION-5] We can add that such behaviour could persist alongside the growth of the activist crowd, rather than fading in its wake.Moore and others are right to identify mass-crowd activism as, in part, a product of eleventh-century demographic change. Documentary and archaeological evidence reveals rapid population growth in Milan, which makes it difficult to follow some historians who dismiss contemporary accounts of crowds as describing rhetorical ghosts rather than real bodies.[CITATION-6] At the same time, much of the character and logic of medieval crowds remains to be uncovered.[CITATION-7] This article argues that to understand the Pataria, and popular collectives in medieval cities more broadly, we need to appreciate the city\u2019s liturgical landscape. We can then see two things: first, how group behaviour was patterned by liturgical norms and expectations, which regularly summoned people on festival days to gather in their streets and churches, where they experienced shared community alongside dramatic displays of hierarchy; and secondly, how processions, which were often central to strategies of urban government, became increasingly unpredictable, and open to disruption and subversion by new popular movements.Just as was the case for early modern \u2018rites of violence\u2019, however, medieval crowds fought not to eliminate the role of Christian liturgy in everyday life, but rather to preserve and purify it against the corruption of powers deemed to be illegitimate.[CITATION-8] Patarine ritual resistance against local elites mobilised the most radical ideas of contemporary religious reform movements, with their explosive social and economic implications: that married men and those believed to have bought their way into church office could not be priests; that their hands would pollute and nullify the sacraments which opened the way to salvation.[CITATION-9] This struggle depended on the ability of liturgy to communicate meaning, to represent not just cosmology but also relations of power. The sacrificial feast of the mass, or the watery rebirth of baptism, were profound attempts to understand humanity\u2019s place in the world. At the same time, as the anthropologist Maurice Bloch observed for rituals more broadly, liturgy was a social technology which was reproduced and recontextualised by actors in historical time. Over time, ruling elites centralised local rites and associated their own status with pre-existing religious mysteries, dramatising links between their identity and the eternal temporality evoked by ritual, which here we can call \u2018liturgical time\u2019.[CITATION-10] Such practices had developed in Christian liturgy since Antiquity. Relics of the special Christian dead had inspired popular veneration before early medieval bishops fought to bolster their authority by becoming the impresarios of saints\u2019 cults.[CITATION-11] The rite of baptism had accrued rich meaning over centuries before Italian city governments sent armed officers to open the portal to Christian rebirth, joining together civic and spiritual initiation.[CITATION-12] Ideology is also always a material phenomenon, something which must be performed and embodied.[CITATION-13] Patarine ritual violence therefore disrupted both a means of symbolic communication and a liturgical economy\u2014that is, the conspicuous flow of commodities needed to materialise religious life: silver treasure, but also fuels to light sacred places, holy oils to anoint bodies, wines drunk before the altar. To follow the ways in which rites remade and responded to the city and its crowds, this article first introduces Milan and its dramatic expansion in the eleventh century. It then surveys Beroldo and other Milanese liturgical sources, and their value as witnesses to the symbolic significance of performances and spaces in the later eleventh century. After then providing a picture of the liturgical landscape and the social and political relations it sanctioned, the article analyses how and why Patarine violence contested rites from 1057 and 1075, reaching crescendos on major festivals of the liturgical year. The decision to disrupt processions is our best evidence that these rites had real power, and that the stakes around their performance were high, at times even fatal. As will become clear, urban liturgy provided both elites and their opponents with a forum and a means for conveying politics and ideology. But in a populous cityscape, the very thing that gave ceremony its legitimacy was the same thing which made it unstable: the crowd.When the Patarines entered Milan in the May heat of 1057, they found a city expanding furiously. Once a capital of the Roman empire (286\u2013402), it had remained since that time the ecclesiastical centre of north-west Italy. Following the demographic decline of the post-Roman era, eleventh-century Milan grew rapidly into a city of tens of thousands, making it one of the largest centres in Europe.[CITATION-14] As it did so it capitalised on its political centrality in the region, and its commanding location between major tributaries of the Po River and Alpine gateways to the north.Symptoms of a step change in urban growth had begun to emerge just before the year 1000, with increasing market activity and large numbers of lay and clerical professionals present in the city. In the following decades property prices soared, toll-free market days were instituted, and waves of rural migrants sought homes or trades within the city\u2019s walls.[CITATION-15] Aristocrats built towers into the sky, while new houses, shops and porticos pressed into and above the old streets, threading narrow lanes () across the city.[CITATION-16] Although the ancient walls enclosed a vast area of some 125 hectares\u2014more than double the size of its nearest rivals (Rome apart)\u2014by the 1020s construction was already spilling beyond them.[CITATION-17] At the same time, clearances and intensified cereal cultivation were transforming the surrounding rural landscape\u2014the sum of many local interventions made in order to feed the growing urban marketplace.[CITATION-18] Within this period, the 1050s were a turning point, the moment when our first evidence appears for significant and sustained market exchange between rural landowners and urban buyers. Peasant producers, typically excluded from accessing central markets, suffered, while a more socially and economically complex world arose in the city.[CITATION-19] By 1066, the growing numbers of merchants and artisans crowding around the central market areas of the forum and the southern edge of the cathedral square included districts of specialised arms manufacturers.[CITATION-20] Meanwhile, Milan\u2019s mint expanded the circulation of coinage in both the city and the countryside.[CITATION-21] The changing cityscape promised elites riches but also danger. The crowding of bodies and buildings sparked devastating fires (those of 1071 and 1075 were especially calamitous), nurtured contagious disease, and summoned rabbles of tradesmen, women in domestic service, and disaffected rural migrants, all of whom were capable of unrest. In the early 1040s, an anti-aristocratic revolt temporarily expelled elites from the city.[CITATION-22] In the next decade, the Pataria represented an unprecedented popular mobilisation.These oppositional movements challenged an aristocratic government headed by the archbishop of Milan. As in most northern and central Italian cities since the late tenth century, the local prelate had taken over many of the prerogatives of royal government, although nominally sovereign power remained with the king of Italy and Germany, Henry IV (r. 1056\u20131106).[CITATION-23] Until a series of crises beginning in 1096/7, all archbishops came from the highest stratum of the local military aristocracy, known by contemporaries as the. These same families dominated the cathedral clergy, and most sought patronage in the archbishop\u2019s court and residence in the city. At the same time, they enjoyed concessions of church properties and tithes in the countryside, which bolstered their local lordships.[CITATION-24] These \u2018knights of St Ambrose\u2019, Milan\u2019s patron saint, identified with the political hierarchy which culminated in the figure of the archbishop.[CITATION-25] Because of the aristocracy\u2019s urban base and its participation in the archbishop\u2019s court, city liturgy had the potential to solemnise not only clerical power, but also that of this wider property-owning elite. Indeed, Milan\u2019s liturgy was highly distinctive in defining the laity as a liturgical order, counted alongside the grades of the city clergy, and under the ceremonial discipline of the leader of the, the Viscount. This elite remained in power until it was displaced in the 1130s by the new secular government of the city commune, which had first emerged as a series of irregular civic assemblies during political crises at the turn of the twelfth century.[CITATION-26] Until then, as the city expanded, processions became an increasingly important means of projecting the authority of archbishop and aristocracy across an ever more socially and spatially fragmented cityscape. In this respect, Milan\u2019s ceremonial life shadowed that of other complex urban centres of the Mediterranean\u2014Rome, Constantinople, Cairo.[CITATION-27] Processions certainly had been significant components in the cultural life of the more sparsely settled landscapes of early medieval Europe;[CITATION-28] but the scale and density of processions in Milan, and their high political stakes, compare far more closely to the frenetic, contested liturgical cultures which had emerged in late antique cities and survived in those major metropolises.[CITATION-29] Our rich picture of Milan\u2019s liturgy in this period is thanks above all to the early twelfth-century order book compiled by Beroldo.[CITATION-30] Beroldo\u2019s text describes the orders both for everyday church offices in the cathedral and for many episcopal processions and special festivals, with indications for prescribed readings and chants as well as clerical dress and deportment. The collection compares closely to the better-known Romanby Benedetto, written shortly afterwards in 1140\u201343.[CITATION-31] All we know about Beroldo comes from his own writings, where he introduces himself by name and profession. He was a warden and candle-bearer () of Milan\u2019s cathedral clergy, one of the church\u2019s minor-order clerics entrusted with custody of the treasury. He wrote after the death of Archbishop Olrico in 1126 (who is referred to as deceased in the text), and before the copying of the twelfth-century manuscript which preserves his collection, MS Milan Biblioteca Ambrosiana, I. 152 inf. This has been dated by the palaeographer Mirella Ferrari to before 1140.[CITATION-32] Beroldo\u2019s work comprises four distinct parts. First is a liturgical calendar (folios 7v\u201315v), which marks the major celebrations of the Milanese church. It can be compared to three other eleventh-century examples: one in an Oxford manuscript (1053\u20131074), and two in manuscripts in Milan\u2019s Biblioteca Capitolare (the first, 1074\u20131100; the other, eleventh-century\u2014probably later than the Oxford example). The calendars attest to a growing number of new festivals over this period, some of which are recorded independently in other documents.[CITATION-33] The next section (fos 15v\u201325v) makes a series of prescriptions for the division of altar donations and gifts among the city clergy and officers who participated in celebrations. The text reflects both the central importance of the liturgy as a means of redistributing resources among the religious elite, and attempts to avoid the tense disputes which inevitably followed.[CITATION-34] The bulk of the collection is found in the order for liturgical celebrations (fos 26\u201393v), in the portion of the manuscript titled.[CITATION-35] This prescribes practice during everyday offices, from matins to vespers, before giving a selective account of the order of feast days and special liturgies across the calendar year. These texts describe liturgical choreography and the order of processions, alongside required readings from scripture, prayers, psalms and responses. They also, again, record attentively the division of honorific duties and payments among individual clerical officers on each day. Indeed, this thorny issue was probably a key motive for Beroldo\u2019s composition. He defended, by setting them in his written record, the rights, honours, and incomes owed to the clerical caste to which he belonged.Finally, interspersed in the main(fos 52\u20137), there is a treatise labelled the. An account of Milanese custom in the last week of Advent, thereveals Beroldo\u2019s ability for original composition. He proudly encoded his authorship in the coloured-ink capital initials of each paragraph, which together spell out BEROLDVS.[CITATION-36] While Beroldo was the original author of this and at least some parts of the remaining text, he was also a compiler, collecting and combining pre-existing liturgical records. Indeed, he declares that his book contains \u2018what I have seen, and heard, and found written\u2019.[CITATION-37] This explains the repetitions and minor overlaps in the text. In this, Beroldo\u2019s book compares to Benedetto\u2019s Roman collection and Constantinople\u2019s.[CITATION-38] Beyond a wish to preserve the rights and incomes of the clergy, the question of why Beroldo sat down to write is hard to answer.[CITATION-39] Some clues are to be found in the date of composition and the manuscript context. The copyist of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana codex put Beroldo together with other texts which aggressively asserted the distinctive status and autonomy of the Milanese church. These include a (probably late tenth-century) panegyric description of the city\u2019s geography and early history, known as the, which included what at the time was a highly contested account of the foundation of the Milanese church by the eastern apostle Barnabas. In the 1090s, one religious polemicist, Bonizo of Sutri, had fiercely denounced Milanese arrogance in promoting such an origin story: by denying the founding work of Roman evangelists, it intended to free the city from dependence on the church in Rome.[CITATION-40] Most arrestingly of all, the manuscript includes a miracle text and dramatic apology for copying the very kind of liturgical codex which the reader held in their hands. The so-called(written before the late eleventh century) tells how, following an attempt by Charlemagne (742\u2013814) to suppress the Milanese rite, an Ambrosian codex and a manuscript of Pope Gregory the Great were placed side by side on the altar of St Peter\u2019s in Rome. The two books burst their bindings, leaving their strewn pages intermingled across the altar. Observers unanimously understood this as an apostolic verdict on the shared legitimacy of Milanese and Roman traditions.[CITATION-41] The composition of the Ambrosian manuscript shows, then, that Beroldo\u2019s text was immediately received as part of a powerful but defensive assertion of the enduring legitimacy of local religious norms. Furthermore, Beroldo and his copyist wrote shortly after 1126, precisely when the episcopal court was losing its political centrality. As we have seen, by the 1130s political leadership was dominated by the city commune and its consuls, who, like other new secular governments in Italy, were centrally concerned with the organisation of civic space and ceremony.[CITATION-42] Beroldo and the copyist therefore intervened just as episcopal control over ritual space was being contested.Restoring Beroldo\u2019s collection to its historical context also reminds us that such liturgical books were normative texts, prescribing actions as their authors thought they should be, rather than transparent descriptions of past practice.[CITATION-43] This, and the fact that Beroldo\u2019s collection was drawn up a generation after the defeat of the Pataria in 1075, are serious caveats if we hope to use the text to illuminate the ritual landscape of the later eleventh century. Moreover, liturgy was never static, but subject to constant innovation and myriad improvisations. How, then, can we be confident that the choreography Beroldo described had anything to do with actual practice in the eleventh century?First, while the copying of Beroldo\u2019s text had a polemical function, there is no doubt it was also intended to be of practical use for clerics. The first seven folios of the Ambrosian manuscript make this clear. They are dedicated to computistical materials designed to aid readers calculating the lunar cycle and the solar year, tasks necessary to determine the dates of Easter and moveable feasts.[CITATION-44] While the order book should not be read as a straightforward script for ritual theatre, its manuscript history suggests that it would be a mistake to deny that it had any relation to lived practices, despite the messy reality of ritual action.Furthermore, as a compiler Beroldo was drawing upon existing texts which are in many cases likely to have been older. By way of comparison, Schimmelpfennig has argued that Benedetto\u2019s Roman ordinals, written shortly before 1143, drew on materials largely dating to the first three quarters of the eleventh century.[CITATION-45] The selection of materials in thesuggests that some (but by no means all) of Beroldo\u2019s sources may have dated to the second half of the eleventh century. He describes, for example, the procession for the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, a feast and itinerary which we know was instituted in 1053 thanks to a surviving private document, which indeed Beroldo cites.[CITATION-46] But no order is given for what we know from other sources was the especially grand episcopal procession to S. Sepolcro on 15 July, instituted in 1100 to commemorate the capture of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem the year before.[CITATION-47] At the same time, some of the information Beroldo provides is demonstrably recent. The festival of All Souls Day was instituted by the aforementioned \u2018late lord Archbishop Olrico\u2019 (d. 1126). On the first day of Lent, he records a mass celebrated over the tomb of another recently deceased archbishop, Giordano da Clivio (d. 1120), \u2018as is the custom\u2019 (). Beroldo probably cited the authority of custom because of the absence of written records, and no doubt with enthusiasm; the mass was marked by a significant emolument paid out to \u2018the whole clergy of the city\u2019.[CITATION-48] Another ritual which almost certainly post-dates the late eleventh century is the archbishop\u2019s remarkable ceremonial bathing on the Monday before Easter of a man who represented a fourth-century leper.[CITATION-49] No record of this appears in an eleventh-century manual of prayers and psalms.While these observations offer no clear conclusion, the leper\u2019s ceremony and the absence of the S. Sepolcro procession underline the patchwork nature of the compilation. It is also at least possible that the otherwise puzzling omission of S. Sepolcro indicates that thesection drew on a core of written materials dating to between 1053 and 1100. To this core, Beroldo evidently added more recent information from newer documents and his own observations, such as the institutions made by recent prelates.In order to establish a firmer context for Beroldo\u2019s work, we can compare it to an earlier Milanese liturgical text, which does demonstrate important continuities with eleventh-century norms. The so-called Ambrosian Manual, or(Biblioteca Capitolare D 2-30), was copied in an eleventh-century hand in the rural church of S. Vittore in Valtravaglia, in the far north of the diocese.[CITATION-50] The structure of the codex reflects its design for practical use. The Manual provides a closely detailed list of the order of prayers, first lines of psalms, and antiphons to be uttered by celebrants across the festivals of the liturgical year. It is remarkably comprehensive. In the manuscript, this text is preceded by a complete psalter, allowing clerics to cross-reference the psalms cited in the Manual, and a calendar. The codex must have been drawn up before 1100, as neither the Manual itself nor the calendar has any notice of the S. Sepolcro festival, and after 1053, as the Exaltation of the Cross does appear in both sections.[CITATION-51] This brings the date of composition much closer to the age of the Pataria.The Manual\u2019s detailed order of speaking parts and Beroldo\u2019s broader descriptions of ceremonial action corroborate each other significantly for important processions and feast days. The Manual reveals, for example, that the Marian procession of Purification began with a blessing of candles at the chapel of S. Maria Beltrade and went on to the cathedral basilica of S. Maria, something Beroldo also describes. The itineraries for other major processions, such as Palm Sunday and the Three Day Litanies, are repeated in both collections. The prayers, responses and spoken directions for baptism on Easter Saturday, too, are near identical. The same psalms for the same procession are noted on Pentecost Saturday.[CITATION-52] The Manual also reveals when Beroldo describes something new, such as the ritual cure of the leper, which is not recorded. Alongside documents such as the 1053 charter for the Exaltation of the Cross, it helps identify those significant parts of Beroldo\u2019s text which, notwithstanding everyday adaptations and instabilities of liturgy, later eleventh-century participants would largely have recognised.The social ramifications of the ritual world uncovered by these sources were unpredictable and unstable; \u2018ritual goes wrong\u2019, as one theorist stresses, and festivals must always have run the risk of being ignored or subverted.[CITATION-53] Yet that world demonstrably mattered to elites, who invested extravagant amounts of time and resources in maintaining the regular calendar of processions, at times in the face of violent opposition. The following section identifies the social geography, symbolic relationships and distributions of resources which processions worked to uphold and which the Patarines aimed to overturn.As in Rome, the archbishop celebrated a complex stational liturgy: a system of worship where the prelate performed church offices away from his cathedral, across different shrines in the city.[CITATION-54] In this way he projected his authority into local neighbourhoods, aiming to forge a single urban community out of a growing and increasingly fragmented cityscape. Processions between cult sites also brought liturgical drama\u2014with its sights, sounds and scents\u2014onto the street. They most often took place on saints\u2019 festivals, typically beginning at the cathedral church and moving to one of the relevant saint\u2019s sanctuaries. Processions for saints were also doubled in Milan, taking place on both the vigil and the feast day itself. The cathedral clergy moved solemnly through city space in imitation of angels, bearing crosses of precious metal, chanting psalms and antiphons.[CITATION-55] At the centre of the city, the sprawling twin-cathedral complex itself was bound together by frequent open-air processions. On the most important festivals of the liturgical year\u2014including Easter, Pentecost, Christmas\u2014the archbishop and his clergy celebrated mobile offices which moved between the winter cathedral of S. Maria Maggiore, the summer cathedral of S. Tecla, the two baptisteries of S. Giovanni and S. Stefano, and the archbishop\u2019s palace. The cathedral piazza was crowded, hemmed in by market stalls and the public and judicial assembly space known as the. In the nearby forum, the commercial heart of the city, the archbishop also reshaped market space. In the 1030s he collaborated with a family of moneyers to found S. Trinit\u00e0, a new basilica which dominated the forum\u2019s centre and became the starting point for the procession of a candle for the Easter candle rite on Easter Saturday.[CITATION-56] These holy day processions therefore extended the liturgical architecture of the cathedral basilicas, and commingled public, commercial, and sacred space.The pre-eminent processional route beyond the cathedrals can be compared to thein Rome, which connected the cathedral church at the Lateran with St Peter\u2019s shrine in the Vatican.[CITATION-57] Milan\u2019s sacred way linked its cathedral complex, the seat of political power, with the suburban church of S. Ambrogio. As Milan\u2019s most venerated cult site and the burial shrine of her patron saint, Ambrose, the church was a focus for pilgrimage and political theatre. It was a place of coronation and burial for kings, and submission for political rivals.[CITATION-58] Therefore the archbishop frequently communicated his privileged relationship with the site and his patron by celebrating mass before Ambrose\u2019s remains. A number of major episcopal processions to the basilica made a further, public display of the bond between archbishop and saint.[CITATION-59] Other parades connected the city\u2019s political and commercial centre with populous neighbourhoods and ancient monuments, such as the procession for the vigil of the translation of San Nazaro, which ended at the great cruciform church dedicated to that saint to the south, by the Roman-era triumphal arch.[CITATION-60] But the processions which most powerfully sought to express the cohesion of the city were the Three Day Litanies. In Milan this festival took place in the week after Ascension in early summer\u2014elsewhere, it was usually celebrated before Ascension.[CITATION-61] Over three days, penitential processions of clergy and people perambulated the walls of the city, stopping at an astonishing thirty-three stations and chanting for the expiation of sin. The populace passed every neighbourhood and suburb, beginning and ending each day at the cathedral. The itinerary and prayers for saints celebrated at each station are revealed in the Ambrosian Manual, as well as earlier liturgical books.[CITATION-62] In an explicit expression of shared civic identity as they passed the city gates, the petitioners prayed for the defence of their walls, the structure which so often symbolised urban communities in the early Middle Ages.[CITATION-63] After three exhausting days, the entire civic body\u2014laity, clergy, archbishop\u2014had traced and experienced a sacred topography which wove the whole city together. This was a liturgical mobilisation on an extraordinary scale, almost unique in eleventh-century Europe. Although the Litanies became associated centuries later in certain northern European communities with rituals of \u2018beating the bounds\u2019, in the early Middle Ages there are no other records of the festival\u2019s processions enclosing an entire city, or exceeding a small number of daily stations.[CITATION-64] At a time of urban expansion, the radical ambition of Milan\u2019s procession to bind its citizenry to an urban space and its monuments appears in sharp relief. Outside of Rome, we do not hear of a comparably expansive itinerary until mid-twelfth-century records of Venice\u2019s Purification boat procession, which rowed far across the city\u2019s canals.[CITATION-65] The archbishop and clergy still had to put the work in to summon a crowd and make liturgy into a popular spectacle. As well as achieving this by routing processions through market spaces and populous neighbourhoods, when attendance was especially important bells were rung and messengers sent to rouse the community.[CITATION-66] While we cannot know how consistently successful the church was in raising crowds, provisions were in place which assumed it often was. On a number of major festivals, for example, clerical wardens () or military officials and their attendants were charged with whips and staves to clear the way ahead.[CITATION-67] Other factors could also draw people to the streets. Spectacular elements displaying symbolic meaning competed to arrest their attention. Clerics wore bright vestments according to the season and hour.[CITATION-68] In a world where artificial light was spare and costly, tall candles and lamps glinted.[CITATION-69] Ceremonial crosses of gold, silver and crystal preceded important figures and groups.[CITATION-70] On Purification, there was the extraordinary sight of a holy icon of Mary and her child, borne on a litter before the archbishop.[CITATION-71] Other senses were triggered too. Incense filled the open air.[CITATION-72] As well as the singing of psalms and antiphons, festivals were announced by bells, wooden clappers, and trumpets. Instruments were also sometimes played during parades. These were crucial means of mass communication in a pre-modern metropolis.[CITATION-73] The multi-sensory impact was more powerful still when lay citizens were participants as well as witnesses in processions, performing control over public space for themselves. While Beroldo does not consistently note popular participation, he reveals a number of cases. The Palm Sunday procession intended a major role for ordinary citizens: a great crowd () was to surround the archbishop\u2019s train, acclaiming him with leaves of olive as he rode out on horseback form S. Lorenzo.[CITATION-74] It was, again, the Three Day Litanies which saw the most extensive popular mobilisation. All the laymen and women of the city were enjoined to process alongside the whole clergy. On their heads they wore penitential crosses of ashes blessed by the archbishop, drawing visible bonds between prelate and citizens. The painting with ashes recalled the Biblical penance at Nineveh, which the Litanies evoked, but this specific practice seems to have been distinctive to Milan. The people also fasted. This marked out and intensified the already arduous physical experience of these collective acts. Everyone, from archbishop to servants, submitted to the same rites of humility.[CITATION-75] In another example, when the Patarines disrupted the festival of Nazaro in 1057, a contemporary chronicle stated that they subverted a great procession of \u2018all citizens of both sexes\u2019 bearing lights.[CITATION-76] The explicit emphasis that contemporaries put on the participation of women underlines that these were extraordinary moments in the life of the city, where social pressures restricting women\u2019s access to public space were suspended.[CITATION-77] The summoning of an audience was not the sole aim of church elites; they also hoped to convey ideas to the crowd. Processions re-animated episodes from Biblical and civic history.[CITATION-78] They worked to embody experiences of consensus, but equally sought to convey and reify hierarchies. They ostentatiously displayed group distinctions between the church\u2019s office-holders, divided in Milan into ten classes or \u2018orders\u2019 (). Beroldo and an eleventh-century historian, Landolfo Seniore, describe in detail the order in which these groups processed, from the cardinal priests of the cathedral church onwards. Each group was preceded by a prior, who wielded a staff () as an emblem of his authority, and by portables such as crosses, books, and censers.[CITATION-79] The ten orders comprised the seven grades of the cathedral clergy; the association of the priests of the city\u2019s other major basilicas, the, who were responsible for the pastoral care of the city and were led by their influential prior, the; and the elder men and women of the confraternity of St Ambrose.[CITATION-80] The final grade was the laity, represented ceremonially by the Viscount, whose liturgical role was also celebrated by Landolfo Seniore. The Viscount sometimes walked before the archbishop, clearing his path on processions at Christmas, Easter, and on the feasts of St Stephen and St John. This made him highly visible, holding before the crowds the staff with which he was formally invested by the archbishop twice a year (again, at Christmas and Easter).[CITATION-81] These moments communicated the symbolic dependency of the aristocracy on the figure of the archbishop, and underlined Milan\u2019s unusual definition of the laity as a distinct liturgical order, led by the urban militia. The processions celebrated the dignity of the city\u2019s aristocratic elite\u2014the\u2014as military officers as well as cathedral men.Above all, and unsurprisingly, the processions dramatised the role of the archbishop as the sacral ruler of the city, especially before mass audiences. When crowds acclaimed the archbishop with fronds in hand on Palm Sunday, they acknowledged him in an act of Christomimetic rulership, re-enacting Christ\u2019s triumphal entrance into Jerusalem.[CITATION-82] At the same time, the archbishop drew on semiotics of secular rulership. He rode not a donkey but a white horse, dressed in ceremonial cloth ()\u2014once distinctive emblems of Roman imperial victory celebrations, and also adopted by the popes in Rome.[CITATION-83] On Easter Saturday, the most important day of the liturgical year, and on Pentecost, the archbishop celebrated his power to create Christian community as he processed to perform baptism. Standing before the cathedral baptistery, he removed his vestments, except his mitre, and put on what resembled a royal or imperial cloak (), and a special belt with a knotted cloth. He also knotted his sandals. These knots were said to imitate sword and spurs. He did this\u2014Beroldo says\u2014\u2018to demonstrate that he is both a king and a bishop\u2019, an audacious assertion of joint civic and sacral rulership.[CITATION-84] Finally, processions and liturgy effected the flow of material, as well as symbolic, exchanges. As in other cities, the rhythms of the sacred year established a pattern for the circulation of coin and resources among church officers.[CITATION-85] Beroldo, as we have seen, details with great attention the division of altar donations and gifts on the major feasts of the year, dedicating a whole section of his work to this matter alone. Alongside money, the liturgical economy distributed bread, fruit and cuts of meat, and the material resources necessary for divine office\u2014wine, holy oil, and candles to light holy spaces. Those who carried processional crosses and other portables won more for their purses and larders.This division of things was sacralised and often ostentatious. The night before the Marian feast of Purification\u2014or Candlemas, the Christianised festival of light\u2014the archbishop blessed a great many candles and handed them out to all the different orders of the church. On the feast itself he blessed and censed them before the assembled clergy.[CITATION-86] On Pentecost Saturday, forty-one wax tablets were bound in the shape of a cross and placed on the baptismal font, before being distributed among the cardinal clergy and the city\u2019s male and female monasteries.[CITATION-87] Cutting across local cults and communities, the semiotics of processions centred the sacral and civic rulership of the archbishop, reified the clerical hierarchy, and solemnised the status of the military aristocracy. But the language and audiences mobilised by liturgy were never static. Church elites innovated, with the new procession in 1100 for the Holy Sepulchre and the leper\u2019s bath at the start of Holy Week being just two conspicuous examples. At the same time, the public forum that liturgy created could be subverted\u2014as happened spectacularly during the years of the Pataria, to which we now turn.The most important indication that the ritual culture of the Milanese church mattered, that it played a real role in reproducing the authority of the archbishop and his aristocratic clients, is that opponents chose to attack it. As the religious scholar Kathryn McClymond has written, disrupted rituals throw into relief \u2018what is at stake\u2019 between competing parties.[CITATION-88] The Patarines\u2019 decision to disrupt urban liturgy, and the inten-sely high stakes of the conflicts which followed, needs to be understood as a challenge to the ways in which cosmology undergirded elite power. It targeted the associations just described, which bound the mysteries of Christian liturgy to the legitimacy of aristocratic government.The environment mattered. In an ever more dense and populous cityscape, Patarine opposition drove confrontation between two kinds of collectives in the street: the regular repetition of liturgical assembly, and the autonomous action of the crowd. Milan\u2019s liturgy promised to promote religious and social community, but it also risked summoning and crystallising the agency of political collectives outside elite control. Alongside the growing problems of crowd control, the semiotics of church liturgy were left open to appropriation. They provided the Patarines with a ritual grammar of resistance.The revolt which became known as the Pataria first emerged in the countryside, but entered the city in 1057, during the office of Archbishop Guido da Velate (1045\u2013.1070), a scion of the region\u2019s castle-holding aristocracy.[CITATION-89] In its two-decades-long struggle against clerical marriage and simony, the movement took up a diversity of tactics. As a popular movement, it frequently turned to riot, and it imposed mass boycotts of church services conducted by priests who were believed to be ritually impure. Its clerical leaders were also skilled preachers; Arialdo, a deacon and the movement\u2019s figurehead until his murder in 1066, \u2018knew the way of the crowd\u2019, in the words of one contemporary establishment chronicler.[CITATION-90] Their sermons denounced married and simonist priests as heretics, whose sacraments were no longer life-giving but worthless and polluted\u2014\u2018dog excrement\u2019 even, matter out of place.[CITATION-91] The Patarines made alliances with other radical proponents of religious reform, including the papacy in Rome, and set up rival institutional centres. The most important of these were at S. Maria alla Porta Nuova, a chapterhouse where clerics lived an experimental life together, celibate and holding property in common; and the monastery of S. Celso. Alongside all these actions, until the movement\u2019s defeat and the violent death of its aristocratic leader, Erlembaldo, in 1075, Patarine campaigns disrupted the liturgy.The shock of the events of these years has left us with several near-contemporary accounts which describe disruptions of liturgies, representing partisans of both the Milanese establishment and the reformers. Arnolfo, a figure close to the episcopal court and hostile to the Patarines, wrote three volumes of a chronicle of Milanese high politics before 1072 and a further two by 1077.[CITATION-92] Another history, conventionally attributed to Landolfo Seniore and probably written soon after 1075, is a scathing philippic against the Patarines and a vigorous defence of clerical marriage and the culture of the archbishop\u2019s court.[CITATION-93] At the same time, we have a hagiography of the Patarine leader Arialdo, written in 1076 by a monk and partisan, Andrea da Strumi, who held Arialdo\u2019s life to be a saintly example of reform activism.[CITATION-94] A sceptical reader might reasonably ask whether accounts of disrupted rituals were rhetorical strategies by hostile observers, seeking to portray the Patarines as guilty of shocking acts of sacrilege.[CITATION-95] Yet many of the events discussed here are corroborated by both pro- and anti-Patarine sources, and indeed the supporters of reform acknowledged their anti-clerical violence. \u2018For the unbelieving and the perverted\u2019, one Patarine priest unapologetically wrote, \u2018the words and deeds of Arialdo, and indeed also of Christ,full of scandal\u2019. This writer took pleasure in recounting how Arialdo beat and stripped the vestments off an \u2018adulterous and simonist\u2019 priest, whipping up the market crowds outside the church.[CITATION-96] In what follows we will examine the most significant examples of the Patarines\u2019 engagement with liturgy and processions, including their most outrageous \u2018scandals\u2019. As we do so, we will draw on our knowledge of the city\u2019s ritual culture to reconstruct the meaning and significance of these disruptions.We have seen that the Patarine campaign was born through the disruption of the 1057 popular procession marking the translation of the holy martyr Nazaro. According to Landolfo Seniore, Arialdo and the Patarine cleric also named Landolfo arrived at S. Celso, the starting point of the procession, to denounce and heckle the assembled priesthood for being married. They disrupted a mass procession, which consisted of crowds of laymen, women, and clergy.[CITATION-97] These events betray the instability of popular religious assemblies, which in a rapidly growing city risked summoning crowds that would tip into riot.The Patarines must have recognised this and seized an opportunity to launch a spectacular outrage before a large, diverse audience of women and men. They disrupted the church\u2019s control of urban space as well as a collective celebration of an honoured moment in episcopal history. The procession from S. Celso to S. Nazaro repeated the fourth-century itinerary taken by the archbishop\u2019s predecessor, Ambrose, when he discovered Nazaro\u2019s relics and moved them to a new tomb in the basilica which later took his name. Aware of this, Landolfo Seniore decried the contrast between the discipline of the cortege under Ambrose and the violent clamour of the \u2018puffed-up marsh frogs\u2019 of the Pataria.[CITATION-98] At around this same time, reformers including Peter Damian in 1059 were drawing attention to the legend that Nazaro, although a local hero, had been sent from Rome to Milan by Pope Linus. In contrast to the Barnabas legend later championed by supporters of the archbishop, the story evoked the city\u2019s dependency on Rome and St Peter. It is possible that the May riot sought to unmoor the cult of Nazaro, one of the most revered in the city, from its context in Ambrosian tradition and move it towards one rooted in pro-Roman narratives of religious reform. When Arialdo was later buried, his supporters deliberately laid him to rest close to the spot where Nazaro\u2019s body had originally been found, in the monastery of S. Celso.[CITATION-99] The gamble paid off. In the hot unrest of early summer in 1057, the Patarines won mass support. Their leaders began to preach openly in the cathedral square. Lay mobs were emboldened to attack the city\u2019s clergy, and to separate them from their wives by force\u2014\u2018with swords and staves\u2019.[CITATION-100] Strikingly, the movement built on its success not only by rooting itself in institutions such as S. Maria alla Porta Nuova, but also by constructing its own processional culture in the city. According to both his biographer and another contemporary ally, the priest Siro, Arialdo led regular solemn processions, barefoot and in ceaseless psalmody, across the city to visit the sanctuaries of the saints, surrounded by his religious brothers. Unfortunately, we do not know what itineraries Arialdo took as he sought the patronage () of the saints. But they began \u2018from home\u2019, the chapterhouse of S. Maria where he now led the common life of the clergy, displacing the topographical centrality of the cathedral church. Arialdo\u2019s biographer also underlines that there was typically more than one station in each procession, which suggests an ambitious attempt to make a broad impression across city space.[CITATION-101] These processions were inherently subversive, rivalling the symbolic communication and claims over public space made by the episcopal liturgy. Indeed, early medieval north Italian canon law collections forbade not just disruptions of processions but also processions without episcopal licence.[CITATION-102] In Arialdo\u2019s counter-processions we see a sustained example of what Shane Bobrycki has identified as \u2018slantwise\u2019 opposition to elite powers.[CITATION-103] That is, alongside direct and violent confrontation, Patarine gatherings worked to redirect the legitimising and redistributive effects of liturgical assemblies.The movement\u2019s audacity grew as it became more rooted in the religious culture of the city. With the passage of years its opposition to the traditional processional culture turned more radical, and more divisive. In speeches which cited Ambrose and other church fathers, Arialdo fiercely condemned the penitential fast upheld during the Three Day Litanies. This interrupted, he argued, the fifty-day liturgical season of joy and feast between Easter and Pentecost. The Litanies fast was often controversial for this reason, although it was far from unique to Milan; indeed, the festival had its origins in a penitential procession and fast ordered in fifth-century Gaul. Nevertheless, for both opponents and supporters, it became intrinsically linked with Milan\u2019s episcopal traditions.[CITATION-104] All the sources, pro- and anti-Patarine alike, report that Arialdo\u2019s moves to disrupt the local celebration of the Litanies erupted in violence. According to Andrea da Strumi, in 1066 partisans heard Arialdo denounce the fasting and rushed to the cathedral square, where the whole city was assembling to begin the arduous procession around the city. In a further provocation, Arialdo himself refused to join the procession at all. He separated himself from the wider community of the city, and instead went to pray at Sant\u2019Ambrogio\u2014one of the stations visited on the first day. Disruption caused by his followers sparked fierce clashes. Both Andrea and Bonizo report that furious crowds sacked the Patarines\u2019 chapterhouse at S. Maria alla Porta Nuova.[CITATION-105] The intensity and violence of the popular response underlines how integral the Three Day Litanies processions had become to the formation of an urban community. As we have seen, this act of binding a people to the space of the city was distinctive in Milan, and especially powerful. The experience was marked out and embodied through visceral, shared sensations: of hunger, repetitive chant, and physical exertion. It is the social power of the festival in its local context, rather than any subtle dispute among intellectuals over its legitimacy, which best explains the strength of Patarine opposition. Opposition to the fast was certainly not an integral part of broader religious reform ideology\u2014Peter Damian even wrote to vindicate the Litanies fast.[CITATION-106] At the same time, it explains why, despite Patarine successes, the disruption turned so many citizens fiercely against Arialdo.With the shock of the Litanies outrage still resounding, the Patarine leaders rapidly stretched their support base to breaking point: they subverted the celebration of Pentecost Sunday, which in Milan took place at the end of that same week, on 4 June, 1066. Both Andrea da Strumi and Arnolfo tell the story. Erlembaldo, the movement\u2019s lay figurehead, had earlier secured a letter of excommunication from Rome against Archbishop Guido da Velate, and Arialdo and Erlembaldo chose to confront him before the packed congregation during the major Pentecost service in the winter cathedral. The disturbance was intended to mobilise the liturgical assembly against the archbishop, and would have caused the suspension of a procession which dramatised episcopal leadership. Following Pentecost mass, the archbishop was to move from the winter to the summer cathedral, to sit on the archbishop\u2019s throne and light two ceremonial candles.[CITATION-107] However, Guido also worked to summon crowds to the celebration. According to Andrea da Strumi (or at least his abbreviator; the original text has a lacuna here), the archbishop had sent out messengers across \u2018the whole city\u2019 the day before to raise an audience hostile to the Patarines. When the confrontation erupted in the cathedral, Guido held the papal bull of excommunication before the congregation. He denounced the Patarines for supporting a decree which violated the autonomy of the Ambrosian church.Interrupting Guido\u2019s sermon, Arialdo and Erlembaldo stood up in full view of the assembly and provoked violent clashes inside the cathedral. Patarine militants then looted the episcopal palace, and stripped and nearly captured Guido, while Arialdo was left seriously injured by the mel\u00e9e. He sheltered with his followers in the atrium of the forum church of S. Trinit\u00e0. However, popular support for Arialdo collapsed over the following days, as even his hagiographer admits, and he soon fled the city. While seeking refuge in the countryside, he was captured and handed over to relatives of Archbishop Guido in their family heartlands by the shores of Lake Maggiore. They mutilated his body horrifically, murdered him, and threw his corpse into the waters.[CITATION-108] His transgressions against the liturgies and processions which so many citizens understood as sustaining urban community\u2014Pentecost, but especially the Three Day Litanies\u2014fractured his coalition and cost him his life.After Arialdo\u2019s death in 1066, the Pataria\u2019s lay figurehead, Erlembaldo, assumed the movement\u2019s leadership. He swiftly rebuilt the party\u2019s strength. A year later popular opinion shifted enough to allow the Patarines to retrieve Arialdo\u2019s corpse (as it was believed) and acclaim him as a martyr. Erlembaldo recognised the power of liturgical time. He chose Ascension Day to display the corpse before S. Ambrogio for ten days. During this time, the Litanies marchers, as well as pilgrims, would have processed past his body. Then on Pentecost, one year after the confrontation in the cathedral, Erlembaldo orchestrated a triumphal procession to translate his comrade\u2019s body to the allied house of S. Celso.[CITATION-109] The Patarine revival continued. Exhausted, around 1070 Guido resigned in favour of the cathedral subdeacon, Goffredo da Castiglione. But Erlembaldo\u2019s supporters banished Goffredo to his family stronghold in the hills north of the city. Guido then tried to resume office, only to be imprisoned by the Patarines in S. Celso.[CITATION-110] However, the reform party too failed to install its own candidate, Atto. On Epiphany 1072, following Atto\u2019s election in the cathedral, an anti-Patarine riot overturned his inauguration feast in the palace and expelled him from the city.[CITATION-111] Milan quickly became a flashpoint in the wider, broiling conflicts between pope and emperor. The Crown pledged its support for Goffredo, consecrated archbishop in 1071 by his suffragan bishops in Novara; the newly elected Pope Gregory VII, a radical proponent of reform, bullishly allied himself with the layman Erlembaldo\u2019s campaign against the clerical establishment, and maintained the legitimacy of Atto\u2019s election.[CITATION-112] Amid this crisis, and with no one able to take up the archbishop\u2019s seat, the Patarines continued to contest the liturgy. Over three years, Erlembaldo disrupted and remade the processions and rites for Easter and Pentecost baptism. First, on Pentecost Saturday, 18 May 1073, he forbade the celebration of baptism and its complex ceremonial.[CITATION-113] This would have disrupted the liturgical economy as well: without Pentecost baptism, there would have been no font-side distribution of the wax tablets which lit church spaces across the city.[CITATION-114] A year later the stakes were raised further. On Easter Saturday, 20 April 1074, following the blessing of the Easter candle, the cathedral clergy processed to the baptistery to consecrate the font with holy oil. The chrism had been sanctified and made fragrant with balsam two days earlier, on the feast of the Lord\u2019s Supper, by one of Milan\u2019s suffragan bishops. Arnolfo and Landolfo Seniore narrate the shock of what happened next. Erlembaldo and his followers appeared armed with clubs, beat the priesthood, and seized the vials of chrism from their hands. Facing the crowds gathered in the cathedral square for baptism, Erlembaldo poured out the holy oil onto the ground and trod it in with his feet.\u2018And so it happened\u2019, lamented Arnolfo, \u2018that the Easter joy did not know its bath\u2019. Provoking his audience further, Erlembaldo produced his own jar of chrism, free from what he and the most radical reformers believed was the fatal ritual contagion transmitted by the province\u2019s impure bishops. By disrupting the Easter liturgies, the Patarines suspended the circulation of ritual commodities critical for renewing episcopal authority. (The same tactic would be used in Rome in 1116: opponents of Pope Paschal II smashed the newly consecrated chrism intended for baptism on the Thursday of Holy Week.) In one more scandal for conservatives, the Patarines organised an alternative baptism for the following Friday, disordering the sacred harmony between rite and calendar, and usurping the self-proclaimed rightful gatekeepers of religious community.[CITATION-115] Such liturgical terrorism was an undoubted outrage. Bonizo of Sutri, fervent ally of the Patarines, passes over the moment in silence, while the shockwaves reached as far as northern Francia. A contemporary polemic in Trier decried Erlembaldo as the \u2018son of death\u2019, who had \u2018the reverend sacraments after their consecration not only poured, not only hurled, but crushed underfoot\u2019.[CITATION-116] To recognise the radicalism of Erlembaldo\u2019s actions, it serves to review the ritual theatre which he disrupted and its wider social significance.[CITATION-117] The Patarines violently overturned the procession from S. Tecla to the baptistery which preceded the consecration of the font. It was during this parade through the cathedral square that the archbishop, when present, put on special vestments to imitate before the citizenry the garb of a king. He was preceded by singing choirboys, bright candles, and the Viscount, making a clear display of the close collaboration between military and ecclesiastical elites at the moment of Christian initiation.Inside, the prelate or his substitute blew on the waters and blessed the font. With a turn of his hand he poured the chrism from a silver spoon into the font three times, tracing the image of the cross. The rite of baptism then followed, beginning with three boys, who were chosen because their names were Peter, Paul, and John. They were theatrically interrogated by the prelate about their Christian belief, and immersed in the waters of the font three times. The archbishop knelt towards the East, anointed the three boys with a cross of oil, and washed their feet. All the bells were rung, and, after his role in baptism was over, the bishop-king mounted a horse and proceeded to S. Ambrogio. Here he celebrated mass with the city\u2019s patron, who had died on the vigil of Easter in 397. The Easter Saturday liturgy displayed the bonds which tied together people, bishop-ruler, and saintly patron.The enormous social importance of this moment had accumulated steeply over centuries, as elites strove to associate the power of baptism\u2019s cosmological significance with the shape of the polity. Since late Antiquity, Christian initiation rites focused the bishop\u2019s power to order and define Christian community. Ambrose had argued that it was through the death-and-resurrection symbolism of baptism that the bishop dissolved relationships of blood and created new bonds of spiritual kinship. The bishop became a parent in this watery rebirth.[CITATION-118] This understanding persisted in the age of the Pataria, when Peter Damian in an address to bishops argued that all those \u2018who are reborn... by the sacrament of baptism must be ascribed to you as your children\u2019.[CITATION-119] Early medieval governments, imperial and urban, pressed these concepts into association with novel understandings of polity. Carolingian intellectuals and legislators argued that baptism integrated political and religious belonging, representing an individual\u2019s oath\u2014the meaning of\u2014which bound them simultaneously to the imperial polity and the mysterious body of Christ. In the Carolingian kingdom of Italy baptism also established economic obligations; legislation, which continued to be copied into eleventh-century law books, expected individuals to pay tithes to the church in which they were baptised.[CITATION-120] As cities grew more populous and fractious in Italy after 1000, the social significance of the initiation rite as a marker of political identity intensified. Noting its importance as a site of conflict resolution in Italy, Peter Cramer has called the baptistery \u2018the place in which the city in its conflicting parts was resolved into one\u2019.[CITATION-121] In Milan as in other Italian cities (Rome apart), the cathedral baptistery was the sole site in the city where the rite could take place.[CITATION-122] The bishop or his representative became the exclusive gatekeeper of urban community, and city leaders exploited the notion that the font was the portal, not only into Christian society, but also into the civic body. When later city communes assumed governmental autonomy, secular elites also appropriated the symbolism of baptism.[CITATION-123] Furthermore, in Italy there were then only two days a year when baptism could take place: Easter and Pentecost Saturdays. Baptism days therefore became immense popular assemblies, when men, women and children from across the city crowded the cathedral square. At the centre was the archbishop, dressed as ruler. In a society in which politics and rule depended on face-to-face interaction, it was only assemblies where, as Timothy Reuter wrote, \u2018the ruler could represent himself as a ruler\u2019, and \u2018the polity could represent itself to itself\u2019.[CITATION-124] This history explains the heady scandal triggered by some spilt oil. Not only were the Patarines seen as profaning the sacraments, but they also overturned the processions and distributions which reproduced the bishop\u2019s role as spiritual kin-maker and gatekeeper to civic community. Landolfo Seniore condemned Erlembaldo\u2019s act as both a sacrilege and \u2018awithout truth\u2019, using the contemporary name for public courts and assemblies which represented legitimate government in the presence of royal representatives.[CITATION-125] And yet, at first, the Pataria survived the outrage. Their mistake came a year later, after a catastrophic fire on the Monday of Holy Week, 1075. Flames raged across the entire city, devastating many of the most important basilicas and the cathedrals. Chroniclers on both sides reported that many perceived the fire to be a providential judgment against the Patarines.[CITATION-126] Instead of seeking consensus after this trauma, Erlembaldo continued to polarise the city by contesting Easter baptism. Just days after the fire, on Saturday, 4 April, he again brought his \u2018unknown\u2019 (so Arnolfo says) chrism to consecrate the font. But the cathedral clergy refused to carry out such a rite, which was \u2018against custom\u2019. Amid the ashes of the city, Erlembaldo enlisted a Patarine priest named Liprando to baptise Milan\u2019s infants. For conservatives, this was a blatant usurpation of the episcopal church\u2019s office to perform the Easter initiation ceremony. In the wake of the great fire, for many this was a sacrilege too far. Days later, the, the knights who were the brothers of the humiliated cathedral clergy, murdered Erlembaldo on the open street. Arnaldo da Rho, a twelfth-century historian claims, dealt the lethal blow.[CITATION-127] Erlembaldo\u2019s corpse was denied burial rites and forced to lie stripped and beaten on the ground. Liprando too was captured. His nose and ears were sliced off as a punishment for his usurpation of baptismal office\u2014canon law barred the mutilated from clerical ministry.[CITATION-128] The elite immediately organised a triumphal procession to celebrate Erlembaldo\u2019s murder and assert consensus after the dislocation of the past years. Twice in two days, the citizenry (), armed militia, and clergy paraded across the city\u2019s sacred way to S. Ambrogio; on the second day, the clergy administered absolution to the assembled populace in their patron\u2019s basilica.[CITATION-129] Joining a rite of reconciliation with a military parade, which aggressively displayed the restoration of aristocratic leadership, would have left obstinate rebels who refused to participate isolated from their fellow citizens. The Patarines scattered, or melted back into their communities.As the preceding discussion shows, urban liturgy provided a powerful stage and medium for the expression of politics and ideology. This was not, however, a stable space. By summoning the crowd which gave the episcopal court its legitimacy, the church invited open challenges to the very hierarchies and performances of power which it worked to celebrate. This tension was especially fraught in Milan, which had a rapidly growing and socially dislocated populace and where radical reform ideas drove so many to resist (aristocratic) clerical wealth and family. But equally, Patarine rites of resistance which appropriated liturgical language were far from risk-free. Arialdo in 1066 and Erlembaldo in 1075 both broke unwritten rules of the game.[CITATION-130] They went too far, not only rejecting the intersection of family power and religious mysteries but also violating performances of civic and religious community, the regular repetition of which\u2014only too evidently\u2014had real power for ordinary men and women. They discovered, as Andrea da Strumi wrote, that \u2018the crowd is quick to change and favour opposing sides\u2019.[CITATION-131] Because they reveal in detail the ways in which processions gained symbolic weight through their relationships with concrete urban spaces and groups, Beroldo and other Milanese liturgists allow us to see this plainly.An interrupted parade for the martyr Nazaro mobilised counter-narratives of holy history, and Arialdo\u2019s processions (dead and alive) rivalled the topography ordered by the archbishop. Radicals overturned the litanies by which citizens took possession of their whole city, and halted knightly parades. Finally, and fatefully, a common priest dared to impersonate the bishop-king as he processed to the baptistery to redraw the boundaries of Christian community. The din of procession attended the birth of eleventh-century Europe\u2019s greatest social movement, and its end. Militants suspended material distributions too, and not just of the oils blessed by bishops\u2019 hands\u2014the ritual matter of salvation. The disruption of ceremonies blocked, and perhaps diverted, the flow of money, wine and lighting materials which circulated to fill the pockets of noble clerics and make liturgy work.The Pataria was defeated in 1075, but the new world of popular politics continued to collide with urban ceremony, if in changing ways. The social significance of the Three Day Litanies, for example, remained. In 1077, rival supporters of the pope and the archbishop chose the festival to rally preachers and crowds, who clashed violently.[CITATION-132] Meanwhile, new episcopal liturgies emerged to celebrate clerical and lay elites in novel ways. From 1100, the archbishop processed to S. Sepolcro, a simulacrum of Jerusalem\u2019s Holy Sepulchre in the forum, while sometime after the Pataria a knight of the da Rho family had assumed the highly visible ceremonial role of groom to the archbishop\u2019s horse on Palm Sunday.[CITATION-133] It is hard not to wonder whether Arnaldo\u2019s murder of Erlembaldo earned the family this honour.It was also around 1100 that new, secular assemblies led by men from beyond the ranks of thebegan to shape city politics. These, too, often followed popular festivals which gathered large audiences, such as Palm Sunday.[CITATION-134] The improvised gatherings would soon assist the birth of a new politics, as they shaped the formation of the commune in the following years. The aristocracy lost its grip on episcopal office in the same period, not least as a result of the pressure of new popular movements, including anti-clerical riots in 1096/7. Meanwhile, the consuls of the incipient commune competed with the archbishop as it looked to invest in public architecture and ceremony which rivalled the archbishop\u2019s. The church still remained at the heart of civic identity, and the bishop\u2019s time still made sacred the squares and streets of the city. But we may imagine some agitation as Beroldo sat down to try to preserve the liturgical theatre and sacred economy which depended on this living calendar. Not only did memories of popular violence mist over his visions of order; he was entering a new world in which time and civic space had more than one master."

    "text": "This article builds on the work of Walter Rodney, Thomas Holt, Gad Heuman, Diana Paton, and others who have investigated the complexities of post-slavery societies in the Caribbean. It addresses the dynamics of resistance and the re-working of legal and cultural processes that took place in the half-century following emancipation. Whereas indenture plays a tertiary role in these previous analyses, it is the central concern of this article. Through a close examination of the 1872 killing of five indentured Indian workers on the Devonshire Castle plantation, I analyse how the institution of indenture restructured the interrelation of the colonial state, labour control and violence in British Guiana. I consider the killings not only in the context typically employed by Caribbean historians to examine race, labour and violence\u2014that of slave rebellions and African-Caribbean revolts in the post-emancipation era\u2014but also in relation to the 1857 Indian Rebellion and in the context of an Empire-wide narrative that justified violent state repression against colonised peoples. Although this is largely a microhistorical account, I hope to provide some useful avenues of analysis by which indenture (primarily approached until now through the lens of social history) can be more broadly engaged as an institution that catalysed a new relationship between the state and labour management, that fostered new (or, at least, revised) discourses of the role of violence in colonialism, and that generated new patterns of response and resistance among subalterns.Atlantic World slavery and its many legacies have become a central preoccupation not just of historians but of a wide public audience interested in the dynamics of race, rights, violence and power in the modern era. This article builds on the work of Walter Rodney, Thomas Holt, Gad Heuman and others who have investigated the complexities of post-slavery societies in the Caribbean. I share with these authors a curiosity about the character of resistance and the reworking of legal and cultural processes that took place in the half-century following emancipation in 1834.[CITATION-1] Where I differ from them is that, rather than relegating indenture to a tertiary role, I place it centrally in my article. Through a close examination of the 1872 killing of five indentured Indian workers on the Devonshire Castle plantation, I assess how the institution of indenture reworked the interrelation between the colonial state, labour control and violence in British Guiana. Maxidally, Kaulica, Baldeo, Beccaroo and Auckloo were shot and killed during a confrontation between local constables and the plantation\u2019s Indian workforce, who had blockaded the entry to Devonshire Castle in protest both over their treatment by the manager and overseers and over how the local magistrate had handled their grievances. I consider the Devonshire Castle killings not only in the context typically employed by Caribbean historians to examine race, labour and violence\u2014that of slave rebellions and African-Caribbean revolts in the post-emancipation era\u2014but in relation to the 1857 Indian Rebellion and an Empire-wide narrative that justified violent state repression against colonised peoples.[CITATION-2] I examine how a labour conflict in British Guiana escalated into fatal violence, how that violence was subsequently rewritten as orderly rule, and how both processes emerged from the distinct historical dynamics of Indian indenture in the Caribbean. Although this is essentially a microhistorical account, I hope to provide some useful avenues of analysis through which indenture, primarily approached by earlier scholars via the lens of social history, can be more broadly understood as an institution.Of particular importance here is how indenture modified the historical relationship between the colonial state and the practices of plantation labour management, prompted novel (or, at least, revised) discourses of the role of violence in colonialism, and fostered new patterns of response and resistance among subalterns. I am also interested in the impact of popular resistance and workers\u2019 agency in the worldwide development of indenture as an institution. The implications of such resistance, how it was articulated by labourers and how it was interpreted by colonial officials, journalists and critics of indenture extend beyond the Caribbean and to the Empire more broadly. This is particularly true of the public debate over workers\u2019 responses to indenture, since the Indian Rebellion of 1857 served as a crucial reference point for interpreting Indian resistance, no matter where it occurred.[CITATION-3] Through my examination of the Devonshire Castle killings in these contexts, indenture emerges as a quintessentially imperial institution, linking India to the Caribbean through formal ties of law, migration and labour organisation, as well as through more informal, but equally powerful, webs of social hierarchy, concepts of race and competing visions of rights and justice.Within this analytical framework, I make two interrelated arguments. The first is that, in the post-emancipation era, indenture shaped the role both of the colonial state and of the character of contests between state officials and the plantation workforce. The position of judicial officers with regards to indentured labourers\u2014as had also been the case in their approach to freed slaves\u2014was highly ambiguous. On the one hand, they were the agents of the principal mechanism for coercion within the plantation system. On the other hand, it was to these officers that workers had to turn as their only recourse to redress their grievances against their exploitative employers.[CITATION-4] In the state\u2019s new role as supervisor of a labour system that was coercive in practice, but technically free and contractual in law and principle, any violence committed against indentured workers required reconciliation with the discourses of liberalism, moral colonisation and orderly rule in a manner that the violent suppression of enslaved Africans had not.[CITATION-5] At the same time, the fusion of the colonial state and the plantation, and of allegedly moral rule with the suppression of legal rights, provided magistrates, governors and other colonial authorities with a powerful rhetorical tool for such reconciliation.[CITATION-6] Since local institutions offered avenues for formal grievances by workers, complaints to colonial magistrates foremost among them, agents of the colonial state could readily portray remonstrance pursued beyond these boundaries as a dire hazard to the entire edifice of colonial law and governance. In the case of the Devonshire Castle riot, magistrates and colonial administrators were able to define the collective protest of plantation workers as violent sedition and an antecedent to a bloody, colony-wide rebellion, even though such protests rarely went beyond anything more serious than the issuing of threats or a public demonstration. The colonial administrators and the press framed murderous violence against workers committed by colonial authorities, in contrast, as a just, moral and proportionate response that had been necessary to preserve order and protect the lives (and virtue) of white residents.[CITATION-7] Over time, this portrayal, constituted across a range of government correspondence and newspaper stories, became the official account of events. In this version, the state rewrote its own narrative of just colonial rule, using the inquiry into the Devonshire Castle killings to perform a powerful ideological function, and employing the Indian Rebellion of 1857 as a compelling historical touchstone.[CITATION-8] A second argument follows from the first and concerns the distinct position of indenture in relation to the state, the latter\u2019s enhanced role in labour organisation in post-emancipation plantation colonies, and the historical significance of Indian workers\u2019 responses to state intervention. The focus of those who criticised or resisted colonial rule\u2014from indentured workers to anti-slavery activists to oppositional elements within the colonial administration\u2014was often on their interpretations of justice and their relationship to local agents and institutions of governance. Local magistrates, in particular, were frequently the linchpins of labour contests, not just in British Guiana but throughout the British Caribbean and across the Empire.[CITATION-9] Magistrates combined the responsibilities of mediation, adjudication and enforcement; they carried authority with the workforce, plantation operators and the colonial administration; they were keystones in administrative post-mortems when labour contests had spiralled into more extreme conflicts; and they commanded a wide public and official audience for their interpretation of events, particularly on the causes and consequences of labour disputes and the justness or injustice of their violent suppression.[CITATION-10] While the authority of the magistrates represented a continuity with the period of slavery, incidents such as the Devonshire Castle killings were indicative of a new phase in the relationship between labour, law, race and governance in the half-century following 1834, when indenture and its attendant legal architecture became a defining feature of a global plantation complex that stretched from Guyana to Fiji. The place of the colonial legal apparatusindentured labourers was very different from its function in the lives of African-Caribbean freedmen and their descendants in the same period. As Diana Paton has demonstrated, African-Caribbeans had a long history of informal engagement with the law which dated back to the slavery period; in the post-emancipation decades, magistrates and their courts had become increasingly integrated into African-Caribbean practices of community conflict and redress.[CITATION-11] In comparison, indentured labourers\u2019 involvement with legal institutions and their agents was confined almost exclusively to the realm of labour relations on the sugar plantations. Because of this narrow engagement, from the perspective of both judicial officials and plantation workers, concepts of law and justice were invariably entangled with practices of plantation labour control.This integration of the state, labour control mechanisms and workers\u2019 responses to them allows us to challenge the tendency of social historians to view protests by indentured workers as apolitical and historically inconsequential.[CITATION-12] Indian protesters engaged with institutions of the state and articulated their own visions of rights and justice. Their contests were subsequently incorporated into the public discourse of both proponents and critics of indenture (and its fusion with colonial law and governance). The ubiquitous references to workers\u2019 deeds and words by government officials, journalists and other public figures accorded these protests political meaning, even if they lacked a cohesive and explicit political ideology. Whether defined as strikes, demonstrations or riots, such events must also be accorded considerable historical significance. Cumulatively, they were integral to the long-running public debate over indenture and its eventual abolition in the early twentieth century. More immediately, they prompted tangible change in the structure and practices of indenture and colonial rule by forcing colonial officials to justify their actions publicly and, often at the insistence of local plantation owners, to reallocate police and military resources in order to deter further disruption. Such responses, in turn, served as grist to the mill of critics who portrayed indenture as exploitative and contrary to the principles of Liberalism and just governance. Therefore, the challenges to indenture, rather than being relegated to the margins in either the historical development of the system or its historiography, deserve a central place in both.[CITATION-13] Before delving into the violent climax of the Devonshire Castle confrontation and how it was subsequently interpreted as an averted rebellion, we must place this incident and its aftermath in a broader historical context. The events of 1872 took place against a backdrop of violent suppression that had been part and parcel of racialised labour control in British Guiana for centuries previously. The Devonshire Castle killings were far from the bloodiest moment in this history. European colonisation of the region dated to the Dutch establishment of a trading post upstream from the mouth of the Essequibo (or \u2018Essequebo\u2019) River in 1616. African chattel slavery was introduced shortly thereafter, primarily to work on tobacco plantations established under the auspices of the Dutch West India Company. English immigrants established themselves in the region in the mid-seventeenth century, lured by the promise of land and better conditions than were to be found in the Lesser Antilles, which was the nearest area of English colonisation at the time. By the 1780s, the British had established themselves as the most numerous European group in Essequibo and the two adjacent regions, Berbice and Demerara (). Thereafter, these three areas would alternate between Dutch, French and British control before finally coming decisively under the latter towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1814.[CITATION-14] British Guiana,.1870 (courtesy of Matilde Grimaldi).Violent conflict between the subordinated plantation workforce and their putative masters had been common across this period. The most serious incidents were the 1763 Berbice Slave Uprising\u2014when a group of several thousand escaped African slaves briefly seized control of the region before being defeated by a combined force of Dutch, French and British troops\u2014and the 1823 rebellion, in which hundreds of slaves perished. After the repression of the rebellion, the death in prison of the British parson John Smith, while awaiting execution for incitement, had helped galvanise the British anti-slavery movement.[CITATION-15] Emancipation in the British Empire a decade later deprived the powerful sugar-planter oligarchy of their primary labour supply.[CITATION-16] The freed African population either preferred to cultivate their own land or demanded wages that made their widespread plantation employment impractical from the planters\u2019 perspective.[CITATION-17] To address plantation owners\u2019 desire for a cheap, thoroughly subordinated workforce, the first cohort of Indian indentured labourers were brought to British Guiana in 1838. They were followed by a quarter of a million more before the British indenture system was terminated in 1917.[CITATION-18] This represented, by far, the largest contingent of long-term indentured labourers in the Americas, and was second worldwide only to Mauritius, which witnessed the arrival of over 450,000 Indian workers in the same period.[CITATION-19] Indenture, which had been introduced to the Americas by English colonists in the seventeenth century as a means of insuring that immigrants were bound to work off the cost of their Atlantic passage, locked workers into long-term, unbreakable contracts that were enforced with penal statutes: by 1870, five years had become the standard in British Guiana.[CITATION-20] It also forbade them from changing employers without permission, and restricted their overall mobility through pass and vagrancy laws adapted from the slavery period.[CITATION-21] Even minor labour infractions were criminalised: the colonial authorities made them punishable by imprisonment, flogging or penal servitude, and also added additional days, weeks or even months to their contracts in order to compensate employers for lost work.[CITATION-22] Those opposing the indenture system initially condemned it, not without reason, as a new form of slavery.[CITATION-23] Indian workers were to occupy the same roles, and even the same living quarters, as former slaves had. Yet the legal aspects of nineteenth-century indenture shared at least as much with the framework of master and servant laws as they did with slavery.[CITATION-24] Regardless of its coercive and exploitative aspects, indenture remained, in principle, a voluntary contract between employer and labourer rather than a relationship of owner and chattel. Anti-slavery interests were largely held in abeyance by the belief that, whatever its flaws, indentured labour was still \u2018free labour\u2019, and that its success might prove the superiority of the latter over the former in economic as well as moral dimensions.[CITATION-25] By the 1860s, both the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (BFAS) (whose origins were closely tied to the initial outcry against indentured labour in the 1830s) and the Aborigines Protection Society (APS) had once again begun to ring the tocsin against indenture in the British Caribbean.[CITATION-26] Much as had been the case with slavery before it, indenture had its fair share of detractors, but it enjoyed powerful supporters in Parliament as well, and no one could deny that the sugar plantations of British Guiana, where indentured workers had replaced slaves, continued to generate vast wealth.[CITATION-27] While the debate over indenture continued, the 1857 Indian Rebellion and 1865 Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica took place. These episodes brought political and economic tensions in the Caribbean colonies into high relief. At the core of discussions in the press and political circles were three connected issues: what were the comparative benefits and liabilities\u2014economic, social and moral\u2014of Indian labourers versus African-Caribbean workers? Where did the balance lie between protecting the rights of Crown subjects, a status both cohorts possessed, and ensuring public order in the colonies? And what level of force was the state justified in employing to preserve the latter?[CITATION-28] The scope and violence of the 1857 Indian Rebellion had exceeded Morant Bay by many orders of magnitude, encompassing resistance across the subcontinent, pitched battles, atrocities on both sides and savage repression by the British authorities with as many as 800,000 Indians killed.[CITATION-29] Nonetheless, the long history of slave rebellions, an entrenched anti-black racial discourse, and the growing assertiveness of free black labour in the Caribbean prompted most British observers to assert that Indians remained more amenable than African-Caribbeans were to smooth incorporation within the schema of imperial labour. Widespread apprehension that replacing the plantation economy with a peasant democracy of black smallholders would be a political and economic catastrophe had, after all, been a primary motivation for importing Indian workers to begin with.[CITATION-30] These concerns over the African-Caribbean population notwithstanding, the events of 1857 had profoundly shaken the confidence of British observers in the tractability of their Indian subjects. The difficulty of reconciling Indians\u2019 alleged docility with widespread labour agitation on the sugar estates would be a prominent issue in public and official discourse following the Devonshire Castle incident.The perceived injustices of colonial administration and the discontent it might foment among Indian workers were taken up directly in the first sustained government critique of indenture to appear subsequent to the events of 1857 and 1865. It was indentured workers themselves who prompted this investigation by staging a wave of protests across British Guiana in late 1869 and early 1870. In so doing, they demonstrated the centrality of the labourers\u2019 own public resistance to the anti-indenture campaign. In the late 1860s, planters\u2019 attempts to drive down wages by importing a surplus of immigrant labour had brought tensions to a boiling point.[CITATION-31] A serious confrontation between workers and police at Leonora plantation in August 1869 had been preceded, much as the Devonshire Castle incident would be, by months of workers\u2019 grievances and discontent over the arbitrary cutting of wages, contract violation, overwork and other mistreatment.[CITATION-32] The Leonora clash, between 300 workers and local constables, had been followed by a series of labour disturbances at more than half a dozen other plantations across the colony in the following months.[CITATION-33] In this period, elements within the Guyanese judiciary also began to criticise the system vociferously.In response to the obvious dissatisfaction among both workers and those tasked with enforcing labour policy, a Parliamentary Commission was convened in 1871 to investigate the situation. As indenture in the colony came under increasing scrutiny, some critical observers blamed the planters and managers for destabilising labour relations on the estates. By antagonising their workers with wage cuts and arbitrary deductions, those in authority had prompted labourers to respond through grievances, wage demands, work stoppages and full-scale walkouts.[CITATION-34] These reproaches fell on deaf ears, and the main Guyanese newspaper,, instead broadcast a sinister picture of the indentured workforce by linking it explicitly with the Indian Rebellion, asserting that participants in the most brutal episodes of 1857 were to be found on local estates. The paper reported that plantations were full of \u2018Sepoys who bore parts in the memorable tragedies of Cawnpore and Delhi\u2019, and the danger of their collusion in a full-scale uprising put all white residents in mortal peril.[CITATION-35] The governor of British Guiana, Sir John Scott, in his communications with the Colonial Secretary, eschewed such hyperbole. But he expressed considerable anxiety about the many agitators on the plantations and the serious danger that \u2018a combination among the whole of the coolies would be formed\u2019.[CITATION-36] The Colonial Office, responding to these alarming reports, agreed to reassign the Second West India Regiment to British Guiana.[CITATION-37] Despite this strong measure and the ominous rumblings on the plantations, the 1871 Commission concluded that indenture, although not without its flaws, had a civilising effect on both Indian and Chinese indentured workers (who were also arriving in the colony in increasing numbers).[CITATION-38] The illusion of a labour system that benefited those in its thrall, despite the constant grievances and work disruptions, and of an Indian population that remained largely docile and tractable, aside from a few malcontents, had been preserved. Lacking any clear direction from either the local government or Whitehall, estate owners made no concerted effort to address the rampant dissatisfaction among the indentured workforce, and any impetus towards reform by the Colonial Office evaporated. Following the Leonora plantation incident, in the public debate over whether indenture in British Guiana was immoral and abusive, prompting widespread discontent, or whether it was just and orderly, with the only trouble being attributable to seditious malcontents, the latter view had won out. This had been accomplished primarily through the success of colonial officials and the local press\u2014both of which groups were entangled with the planter class and invested in the colony\u2019s continued profitability through indenture\u2014in redefining the temporal and geographical context of workers\u2019 demonstrations from the realm of labour relations to that of violent rebellion and in recasting unhappy workers as conspiring mutineers. In doing so, they had neatly reconciled the violent suppression of indentured labourers with the principles of Liberalism and moral rule. This set the precedent for how official discourse and public recounting subsequently constructed the Devonshire Castle incident. In the latter case, the challenge of squaring a violent state response with just rule was even greater, given that there were five dead workers to account for, and therefore required an even stronger association to be made between the demonstrators and the 1857 Indian Rebellion.In the days preceding the violence at Devonshire Castle, the consequences of maintaining theon the sugar estates while giving only a cursory nod towards workers\u2019 complaints became clear. The work of the 1871 Commission had raised expectations among the indentured labourers, who had sought out the Parliamentary investigators and bombarded them with their grievances.[CITATION-39] The failure of reform had only amplified workers\u2019 widespread discontent with both affairs on the estates and a judicial system that was, in their eyes, fully subordinated to planter interests.[CITATION-40] Far from being a spontaneous outbreak of violence, the final conflict between workers and police was the culmination of several months of rising tension at Devonshire Castle, tension that emerged from the same concerns that had prompted workers\u2019 grievances prior to the 1871 Commission. As several witnesses testified during the course of the coroners\u2019 inquest that followed the killings, the main complaints of the indentured Indian labourers concerned the labour conditions (pay especially) on one hand and their belief that they were being denied justice and the rights to which they were entitled on the other. Such complaints were endemic to the indenture system, as they had been in the \u2018apprenticeship\u2019 system that had kept former slaves in thrall to their former masters for years after emancipation.[CITATION-41] And even if the details of colonial governance were often beyond their knowledge, labourers were generally familiar with key government personnel. The right to petition the local magistrate in contract grievances and to approach the local Immigration Agent with such complaints, in particular, were familiar to the indentured workforce.[CITATION-42] Most workers were also sceptical that their grievances would ever be taken seriously, given the close relationship between magistrates and plantation managers.[CITATION-43] However, from the published account of the Devonshire Castle inquiry, the correspondence between local officials and higher administrators, and the manner in which the incident was subsequently reported to the public in both British Guiana and Britain, one would hardly have known that workers had any understanding of the indenture system, or any intention to resolve their complaints peacefully. The dismissal of such complaints, and the categorical rejection of alternative ideas of justice, had been commonplace in colonial authorities\u2019 treatment of former slaves and immigrant workers for many decades.[CITATION-44] In contextualising the resistance of the Devonshire Castle workers to plantation discipline and the subsequent response of local authorities, the long history of racialised violence in Britain\u2019s Caribbean colonies must also be taken into careful account. But socially, legally, and culturally, indentured labourers in the 1870s British Caribbean occupied an historical space distinct both from that of enslaved Africans in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and from the free African-Caribbean population of later decades. Their situation was most closely analogous to that of formerly enslaved African-Caribbean \u2018apprentices\u2019 in the immediate post-emancipation era. And it was apprenticeship, as much as (if not more so than) slavery, that served as a blueprint for indenture in British Guiana and across the Caribbean.Indenture, much like apprenticeship, constrained the mobility and agency of its subjects, but offered avenues for grievances and resistance that had been denied to slaves. Structurally, individual and collective methods of contestation and protest, from complaints to absenteeism and work stoppage, were also similar between indenture and apprenticeship. Under slavery, such tensions were resolved through informal negotiations and the establishment of customary rights.[CITATION-45] In contrast, the two successor systems to slavery, apprenticeship and indenture, erected a scaffolding of laws, rights and formal procedures that established the colonial state, its legal institutions and the agents of law, policing and inspection as the primary mediators between workers and employers.[CITATION-46] These structural differences had a cultural corollary. Former slaves and their descendants often employed slavery as the cultural (or, in the 1830s and 1840s, experiential) touchstone for their understanding of freedom and their protests against being denied their vision of its benefits; indentured labourers more commonly expressed their ideas in relation to this subsequent matrix of law, justice and rights.[CITATION-47] Indentured workers\u2019 encounters with the evolving practices of post-emancipation plantation labour organisation, encounters that began with their recruitment in India and continued throughout their sojourn in British Guiana, helped propagate a self-awareness of rights that, along with a familiarity with their legal rights. This familiarity, along with their awareness of their status as British subjects and contractual individuals, shaped their responses to both employers and state agents.[CITATION-48] The reactions of the Devonshire Castle workers and their confr\u00e8res on other plantations to perceived injustices were in line with this contractual identity. Indentured workers had a concrete and specific conception of what their rights were in these circumstances, and they were determined to exercise them, as later events would demonstrate. Many of their actions evinced a desire to engage with state agents and institutions of rule, albeit on the workers\u2019 terms and in line with their own expectations of justice, rather than to defy them or to deny their authority.Much of the discursive reconfiguration of the labour contest on the Devonshire Castle plantation that interpreted the event as an incipient rebellion was carried out via the system of colonial justice that was itself both a vehicle for and a key focus of workers\u2019 grievances.[CITATION-49] In this process, managers and overseers not only enjoyed a privileged voice in legal venues, but occupied many of its most influential roles.[CITATION-50] The first stage of this rewriting of a protest into a rebellion was the Coroner\u2019s Court inquest that followed the killing of five indentured workers during a confrontation with a local magistrate and a squad of armed constables on the road to the plantation. A Coroner\u2019s Court was a temporary judicial body convened to conduct an inquiry into any deaths deemed out of the ordinary. The witness testimony offered there (and published in, the main press organ of British Guiana) was the constant point of reference for all subsequent discussions of what had happened at Devonshire Castle and in the surrounding district (Essequibo) in the days leading up to the fatal encounter on the plantation road. Far from being independent entities, Coroner\u2019s Courts were dominated by those with a vested interest in the plantation system. They were assembled by local Justices of the Peace, and at the time of the Devonshire Castle killings one-third of all JPs in British Guiana were resident managers on sugar estates.[CITATION-51] The four-person jury for such proceedings was drawn from the other employees of the estate, often with the manager of a neighbouring plantation serving as the presiding coroner.As the inquest recast the protests of Indian labourers as sedition and the precursor to a colony-wide rampage, the fusion of state and plantation interests became starkly visible. As a result of both his rank and his key role in the incident, the figure wielding the greatest power in the proceedings was Henry Loughran, a local stipendiary magistrate. Loughran had been in command of the force of constables that had confronted the workers of Devonshire Castle in the incident that left five of the latter dead from gunshot wounds. His version of events, more so than any other, shaped both the official and public recounts that followed. As was made clear by a discussion over procedure at the beginning of the inquest, he was the true authority in the court, effectively managing the conduct of an inquiry into his own actions and those of his constables.[CITATION-52] Other central figures who offered substantial testimony included Loughran\u2019s clerk, John Blake, and the manager of the Devonshire Castle plantation, Peter Abel. All three concurred that events were set in motion not by ongoing tensions between managers and the plantation workers, but rather by the violent predilections of agitators among the latter.Loughran was the last witness questioned. He spoke with the advantage not only of his official role and his familiarity with court protocols, but also in full awareness of the testimony that had preceded his own. He commenced by recounting his first involvement in the incident. On the morning of 27 September 1872, Loughran and Blake were approached by Peter Abel, who wished Loughran to write warrants for the arrest of two of his labourers, claiming that they had refused to work and had made threats of violence against him.[CITATION-53] The magistrate proceeded to the plantation to speak with the local immigration agent while his clerk, Blake, returned to the local police station. There, Blake encountered a group of between 250 and 300 labourers from Devonshire Castle, walking up the road and led by a man named Paraag.[CITATION-54] The clerk was able to detain Paraag temporarily, but Blake reported that, when the other workers threatened to wreck the police station if he was not released, the clerk returned him to his comrades. Their leader restored, the crowd continued their march. Soon afterwards, Loughran himself arrived at the police station and, after speaking with Blake, set out to intercept the labourers. Overtaking them in his wagon, the magistrate inquired about their purpose. Paraag and another spokesman told Loughran that they were going to the capital, Georgetown, to bring their grievances before the colonial governor, the main issues at hand being unfair wages and an alleged assault on Paraag by a plantation overseer.[CITATION-55] Loughran testified that his response to what was clearly a tense situation was sympathetic but firm. He asked them to cease their march to the governor, and promised that he would come to Devonshire Castle plantation in person the following morning and \u2018hold an inquiry on the spot\u2019. \u2018After much loud and angry talk among themselves\u2019, the magistrate reported, the workers complied.Loughran couched events in the broader context of imperial disorder. He testified that his approach was guided by his earlier experiences of fatal unrest in Ireland, where he had \u2018been engaged in quelling the Belfast Riots in 1864, in which 30 people were killed\u2019.[CITATION-56] However, at the time of his first encounter with the Devonshire Castle workers, they had committed no violent acts to his knowledge. The explicit conflation of events in Essequibo with other, more ferocious incidents of mass unrest in the Empire became a running theme throughout the accounts of those involved. Such references allowed the magistrate and other witnesses to disguise the specific causes of the workers\u2019 dissatisfaction with labour conditions. Instead, witness testimony defined them as potentially violent rebels from their very first encounter with colonial authorities. These accounts were infused with explicit and implicit references to violent slave rebellions and to the more recent 1857 Indian Rebellion. These dual historical contexts, in the face of otherwise ambiguous evidence, set the tone for subsequent interpretations by both administrators and the reading public.Equating a non-violent demonstration by workers to violent unrest and incipient rebellion also provided a justification for Loughran\u2019s rapid decision to prepare an armed response. Following his initial meeting with the demonstrating workers, Loughran called for immediate reinforcements from police forces in neighbouring towns.[CITATION-57] This escalation was vindicated, the magistrate told the jury, by his encounter with a second group of angry labourers, from the Anna Regina plantation (). They surrounded his wagon and \u2018demanded vengeance on their manager, Mr. Shaw, who they stated had threatened to shoot some of their body a few hours previously\u2019.[CITATION-58] Loughran mollified them with promises of free court summonses. The following morning, he met with Shaw, who showed evidence of minor assault by the workers, whom he had dispersed by brandishing his pistol at them. The magistrate then led his newly assembled force of around two dozen armed constables to Anna Regina in order to arrest the man identified as the ringleader in the assault. He was instead confronted by an inebriated worker, whom Loughran asserted was a provocateur hoping to incite fatal mayhem. \u2018If we had arrested this man I am perfectly assured the coolies would have rushed out and murdered every one of us\u2019, he told the court.[CITATION-59] The tale of the Anna Regina confrontation, from the perspective of a juror, should have had no direct bearing on subsequent events at Devonshire Castle. These were, after all, two completely separate groups of workers, working nearly 10 km apart, and the cohort from Anna Regina had no involvement in the subsequent, fatal clash with the constables. In the context of Loughran\u2019s broader testimony, however, it gave weight to his portrayal of Essequibo as a district teetering on the precipice of a full-blown rebellion by drunken, savage coolies, howling for bloody vengeance against their masters.Essequibo district and environs,.1870 (courtesy of Matilde Grimaldi).Returning to the events of 1872 and the character of the subsequent inquiry with these considerations in mind, we can see that Loughran\u2019s assertions were made credible primarily by the focus of most witness accounts on the days immediately preceding the shootings. Claims that the workers of Devonshire Castle had no genuine interest in resolving their complaints peacefully and that their actions should be seen only in the light of Indians\u2019 innate propensity for violent sedition are not consonant with their longer-term antecedents or with the labourers\u2019 behaviour in the preceding weeks and months. Loughran\u2019s narrative of events, full of references to 1857 and threats of violent rebellion, permitted him to shape the public interpretation of the workers\u2019 actions. Details from the testimony by the manager of the plantation (Abel), in contrast, revealed that the labourers had been expressing dissatisfaction with their pay for nearly a year. The specific catalysts for the demonstration encountered by Loughran and Blake had a much more protracted history as well, and had been slowly escalating for a month before the killings happened. The workers\u2019 actions in this period had included a collective demand for wage increases, seeking the magistrate\u2019s intervention, work stoppages in protest of perceived contract violations, and making complaints to the Immigration Agent, Mr King.[CITATION-60] In the months leading up to the killings, the Devonshire Castle workers had been neither violent nor destructive. As King emphasised, they had not been entirely unjustified either. The narrative of a riot\u2014a spontaneous, violent confrontation prompted by the groundless anger of a few malcontents\u2014was only plausible if the events of late September were detached from the longer context of strained labour relations at the Devonshire Castle plantation and in the colony as whole. The decoupling, in both the enquiry and the subsequent public accounts, of the Devonshire Castle confrontation from the previous months of tension, the workers\u2019 persistent assertions of their rights as Crown subjects, and their determined engagement with state agents via accepted protocols was therefore a necessary corollary to the reframing of the incident in the context of the 1857 Indian Rebellion.Even the initial attempt to arrest Paraag, one the alleged ringleaders of the dissatisfied workers, was merely an extension of the long, drawn-out contest over labour control on the plantation. It was Paraag\u2019s disruption of work in the sugar-production buildings and his disrespect and threats towards the manager that had prompted the latter to take action. The arresting officer, Pompey Reid, was himself part and parcel of the plantation\u2019s labour management regime, and only a constable on occasion. His primary employment was as the driver of a \u2018coolie gang\u2019 (i.e. an Indian work-party) at Devonshire Castle. Following this initial arrest attempt, which had been unsuccessful, Loughran, as he had promised, visited Devonshire Castle the next day (Saturday) to hear the grievances of Paraag and another worker under oath. Loughran granted the aggrieved workers free court summonses against their alleged attackers, and made the latter promise, before the assembled workforce, that they would appear to answer these charges two days hence in Daniel\u2019s Town (i.e. Monday, 30 September). Neither Saturday nor Sunday saw any further incidents. According to the magistrate\u2019s testimony, when he arrived at the Daniel\u2019s Town courtroom on Monday, \u2018the road was filled as far as I could see with coolies armed with hackia sticks [i.e. staves]\u2019.[CITATION-61] When the case was declared open, in English and Hindi, the complainants did not appear. Loughran told the court that the only response of the assembled crowd was to shout and bang their staves together, after which they all left.According to this narrative, the magistrate had once again made every attempt to accommodate the workers\u2019 grievances, and it was only their wilful and capricious behaviour that had derailed their case. Other witnesses offered a very different picture of the events, one in which the workers had made a sincere effort to engage the court, but had been discouraged by the magistrate\u2019s show of force. Madaree, another indentured labourer from a different plantation, who had been serving as an interpreter for the court at the behest of his plantation manager, was quite specific in his explanation of the complainants\u2019 behaviour and motivations.[CITATION-62] Paraag and the other workers with grievances had indeed been present, he told the jury, but had walked out of the Daniel\u2019s Town courtroom as soon as the case was called. When Madaree, following Loughran\u2019s instructions, went out to bring them back, \u2018they said, they would not try the case there because the magistrate would not give them justice, but would favour the overseer and manager\u2019. For Paraag and others, their lack of faith in Loughran\u2019s commitment to a fair hearing was based on evidence they could see with their own eyes, as the magistrate\u2019s clerk himself testified subsequently. Loughran had brought his rifle-wielding constables into the courtroom, and the plaintiffs took the presence of so many armed men as a sign that the magistrate had already decided against them.[CITATION-63] It was only after having received, to their mind, a clear indication that they would not find justice at the Daniel\u2019s Town courtroom, that the protesting workers took more direct action. Yet they continued to couch their aims in the language of rights and justice, expressing the hope that, if not in the local court, they would receive their rightful due elsewhere. Before quitting the town, they announced their intention to Madaree, the interpreter. \u2018They said they would go home and wait on the road for the overseers, the manager and the magistrate; and they (the coolies) would not allow them to go into the estate and would not allow any one to go into the estate until they got their rights\u2019.[CITATION-64] These rights were specifically what they demanded when Loughran later arrived at Devonshire Castle, along with his clerk, a police inspector and two dozen armed constables, some of whom were also Indian immigrants.[CITATION-65] There, he found the plantation workers, in Loughran\u2019s words, \u2018drawn up across the entrance to the estate in battle array\u2019.[CITATION-66] According to Madaree, when the magistrate\u2019s contingent arrived, the exact words of the spokesman for the workers were \u2018\u201cthe magistrate must keep court here and give us our rights\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-67] Rather than defying Loughran\u2019s authority outright, the labourers had relocated the site of adjudication from the courtroom to the plantation, asserting both their entitlement to justice on their own terms and their right to block access and cease all work until their grievances were addressed.Throughout the confrontation, the workers evinced a willingness to engage directly the institutions of the state, its representatives and its processes, from marching to the governor to bringing grievances before the magistrate to demanding the rights to which they believed they were entitled as subjects of the Crown. Their public statements also made it clear that they held the state at fault for their treatment as much as, if not more than, they did the plantation managers and overseers. The latter may have been more direct in their exploitation, but the magistrate, they asserted, was abetting this abuse and denying them justice. Though resolute in their demands for a fair hearing, the demonstrators of Devonshire Castle had stopped short of violence. They had made threats, but had harmed neither persons nor property. Witness testimony, in contrast, divorced the actions of workers from the long-running, non-violent dispute over conditions at Devonshire Castle. Instead, those who testified placed the conflict in a context that fitted far better with the overall description of a nascent rebellion, that of the 1857 Indian Rebellion. Abel, the plantation manager, and Lutchman, an Indian constable, both claimed that there were \u2018Sepoys\u2019 among the plantation workers. Abel hinted darkly at the havoc they might have wreaked if they had located the guns he kept on the estate. The magistrate himself gave the starkest warning of the workers\u2019 potential for violence. Loughran described them as abusive, enraged, unreasoning and bent on slaughter, \u2018all determined in my opinion to ruthlessly murder all who were opposed to them\u2019.[CITATION-68] \u2018There [] conduct was such that no person not accustomed to seeing excited Hindoos could imagine it\u2019, he told the jury. \u2018The men were actually foaming with rage and the women assumed the appearance of regular demons. I saw that parleying any further was useless\u2019.[CITATION-69] The magistrate then read the Riot Act, which was translated for the benefit of the assembled crowd. After another hour and a half of back and forth between the two parties, the magistrate instructed the constables to load their rifles and fix bayonets, but not to fire unless he specifically gave the order. And then, in the final point on which all witnesses agreed, he gave the order for his constables to advance and arrest Paraag and the other alleged ringleaders in the crowd. As the two groups collided, one of the rifles went off, followed by nine more shots in quick succession. The workers immediately scattered. Five of their number were dead or dying; another half-dozen were wounded. One constable had been injured badly enough to require treatment in hospital, but that was the extent of police casualties.In concluding his testimony at the coroner\u2019s inquest, Loughran was effusive in his descriptions of the constables\u2019 conduct, declaring that \u2018great praise is due to each and every one of those gentlemen for their manly and courageous conduct in assisting to suppress the riot\u2019.[CITATION-70] Although he was \u2018deeply grieved\u2019 at the death of the five \u2018misguided and unfortunate coolies\u2019, the magistrate was adamant that the residents of the entire district owed their continued existence, and the women their virtue, to the policemen\u2019s heroic acts. \u2018I believed then as I do now that the firing of the rifles saved the lives of not only the few supporters of law and order that were present from immediate destruction. I further believed that if the coolies had overcome the police the county of Essequebo would have become a scene of murder, rapine, and pillage\u2019.[CITATION-71] The jurors were fully in accord, returning a verdict of \u2018justifiable homicide\u2019 and adding that, in their opinion, \u2018but for the discharge of the rifles \u2026 the riot would have extended over the whole district\u2019.[CITATION-72] The Coroner\u2019s Court thus exonerated Loughran and his constables. Disseminated through the account of the inquiry reprinted verbatim in the pages of, the narrative of a barely averted rebellion would subsequently become entrenched in public discourse. To sustain its plausibility, this narrative required the shearing of the incident away from the persistent tensions between indentured labourers and plantation managers in the preceding years and from the workers\u2019 escalating demands for amelioration and official intervention in the preceding weeks. But was there any concrete connection between Indian migration to the Caribbean and the 1857 Rebellion, or was the assertion that violent \u2018sepoys\u2019 who had participated in that rebellion lurked among the crowd on the plantation road completely fabricated? Such links did exist, but they were not of the kind proposed by witnesses during the inquiry. West Indian sugar planters had taken full advantage of the post-1857 exodus from India to recruit heavily from the areas of the subcontinent most affected by the conflict and the famines and epidemics that followed in its wake.[CITATION-73] But the numbers of those actively involved in the uprising who were recruited to work in Caribbean plantations was minimal, and the odds that there were \u20186 or 7\u2019 sepoys among the Devonshire Castle workers, as Lutchman had claimed, were vanishingly small.[CITATION-74] It was far more probable that Loughran was confronting some of those who had suffered in the aftermath of 1857 than he was its participants.In contrast to the tenuous connection between the Devonshire Castle workers and the 1857 Rebellion, the colonial state\u2019s response to labourers\u2019 protests drew directly on strategies adopted to quell civil disorder in India and elsewhere in the Empire. This response was also shaped by widespread anxiety over potential rebellion among African-Caribbeans, an apprehension greatly exacerbated by the Morant Bay Rebellion of 1865 and which had its long-term roots in the pervasive fears of slave uprising prior to 1834. In the wake of Morant Bay, police forces across the Caribbean had been restructured, and military presence reinforced, in order to deal with the perceived threat of further rebellions. Although governors stopped short of creating an armed white militia, as some planters had demanded, police forces saw local members replaced with recruits from other islands in the region.[CITATION-75] Paralleling Loughran\u2019s evocation of the Belfast Riots in his testimony, the efforts to suppress dissent in Ireland had served as one of the primary blueprints for this reform. As administrators had recruited and armed their local police, they had looked to the Royal Irish Constabulary for their models.[CITATION-76] This distinctly colonial response, which relied on the enhanced authority of local magistrates over an armed constabulary, backed by the ready availability of regular army forces, bore little resemblance to measures taken against labour unrest in the metropole. Britain itself, in contrast, had seen the systematic rationalisation and professionalisation of police forces, and their explicit segregation from both the magistracy and the army.[CITATION-77] By the end of the nineteenth century, the former had been stripped of its supervisory role over the latter in favour of a purely judicial role.[CITATION-78] Thus, just as indenture itself was a distinctly colonial formation, the state response to fractious indentured workers was similarly racialised and embedded in the precedents of colonial governance both in its structural (the reorganisation of police and military forces) and cultural (the pervasive fear of slave rebellion or Indian uprising) dimensions. By the same token, workers\u2019 responses to their circumstances also emerged from the distinct relationship between plantation, state and labour generated by the indenture system. Their actions in some instances drew on practices that had been common in the period of slavery (for example, informal negotiation), while in others they more closely resembled the tactics of freedmen in the apprenticeship period (for instance, appeals to magistrates), and at other times represented novel adaptions to the specific conditions of indenture (such as assertions of contract violation, petitioning immigration agents and parliamentary investigators).From the perspective of Loughran and others embedded in the collaboration of state and plantation, workers\u2019 systematic adaptation to and engagement with legal processes and language were mere window-dressing for their fundamentally violent and rebellious natures. In their testimony, where the facts of the episode did not fit this interpretation, they were simply elided or dismissed as aberrations. The coroner\u2019s inquest was only the first part of the story. In subsequent events, the ways in which indenture had reconfigured the relationship between the state, the plantation system and those who lived under their authority would become even more clear. The aftermath of the killings would also reveal the event\u2019s broader historical significance as it resonated not only throughout the colony, but across the broader context of imperial governance and the public debates over race, labour and justice in the Empire. Another judicial venue would provide the stage for the next chapter in this ongoing drama. At the time of the coroner\u2019s inquiry, the alleged ringleaders of the Devonshire Castle workers had yet to face trial. The direct involvement of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley, in the affair raised both the prominence of the incident and the stakes for all of those involved. In the correspondence between high colonial administrators, the indenture system and the violent suppression of workers\u2019 demonstrations were reconciled with the principles of Liberal individualism and just governance. The testimony of Loughran in the trial and the accounts of other middle-men\u2014magistrates and managers in particular\u2014played a key role in this process. Initially, Kimberley had doubted that the Devonshire Castle labourers had gone to such extreme measures as Loughran had asserted (that is, fomenting rebellion) with no substantive cause. In his view, and contrary to the assertions of the earlier Parliamentary commission on labour in British Guiana, their grievances concerning work hours, underpayment and contract violation were justifiable and deserved a \u2018strict and searching investigation\u2019.[CITATION-79] The pre-trial response of the governor of the colony, Sir John Scott, to Kimberley\u2019s inquiry was a staunch defence of both the system of colonial governance and the intervention of the police authority. He also condemned Indian immorality and would-be rabble-rousers in very strong terms. Scott\u2019s comments reflected his support for what was, by this time, a standard response by most colonial officials to any deliberate disruption of estate labour. He insisted that the fault lay not with the actions of Loughran and his local officers, nor with any abuses of the indenture system either specific or general, but rather with the immorality of a few malcontents and the general excitability and pliable will of the Indian population.[CITATION-80] As with the testimony at the coroner\u2019s inquest, this official narrative required a very selective retelling of recent events in British Guiana. In the 1869\u201370 disturbances that served as Scott\u2019s implicit point of reference, although the confrontations between indentured workers, constables and plantation managers had involved missile-throwing and threats, only one serious injury had resulted.[CITATION-81] There was evidence neither in the conduct of workers nor from the thorough investigation by the 1871 Commission to support Scott\u2019s assertion that \u2018men of energy and turbulent spirit\u2019 had the potential to become violent rebels with the power to recruit others into their sedition.[CITATION-82] As with so much of the discussion surrounding the incident, this explanation only seemed plausible in the context of the 1857 Rebellion and what, to many British observers, it implied about the power of agitators to rile an otherwise peaceful and deferential Indian majority. Nonetheless, in the wake of the Devonshire Castle killings, reconciling an official record that contained little concrete evidence of violence on the part of Indian indentured workers with the descriptions of them by magistrates, police, managers and other agents \u2018on the ground\u2019 as being violent, and even as potentially seditious, proved problematic. Although Scott placed great faith in the accuracy of the magistrates\u2019 account, he stopped short of validating one of Loughran\u2019s most crucial claims, which was that the Devonshire Castle and Anna Regina workers had been colluding in the first stages of a colony-wide revolt.[CITATION-83] The pressing need for officials at all levels to present the appearance of just and moral colonial rule proved to be a double-edged sword. In any trial for a crime too serious to fall under a magistrate\u2019s power of summary adjudication (that is, without a jury), the colonial court system, much like the system in Britain itself, depended on the collusion of a diverse and sometimes unco-operative populace who entertained their own ideas about justice.[CITATION-84] The vulnerability of this system became clear when the alleged Indian ringleaders faced a jury trial in the higher court located in Georgetown, the capital. There, despite the overwhelming weight of evidence against the defendants, three jurors, all from the Portuguese petite bourgeoisie that harboured long-standing resentment against the planter class and their putative allies in the magistracy, refused to comply with the majority of the jury and find the prisoners guilty of violating the Riot Act.[CITATION-85] In the retrials that followed, a further succession of juries similarly failed to convict the defendants. Governor Scott expressed his exasperation to Lord Kimberley after the third of these unsuccessful proceedings. The defendants were all discharged, and most returned to the Devonshire Castle estate. The five alleged ringleaders received more severe treatment, despite the verdicts exonerating them. Scott employed his special powers under the Immigration Ordinance to disperse them among separate estates in a different part of the colony. He also directed the police in Essequibo to remain vigilant, lest the rumours circulating about the workers\u2019 secret night-time meetings, plots to murder Abel and efforts to purchase firearms should prove true.[CITATION-86] Ultimately, it was the responsibility of Lord Kimberley, the Colonial Secretary, to summarise the events at Devonshire Castle for the Prime Minister. This final, crucial communication would set the tone for how those with the greatest investment in the orderly governance of Britain\u2019s empire would interpret what had happened in Essequibo. It coincided both with a rising swell of criticism of indenture across British colonies from the Caribbean to India and with the expansion of the system into new regions of the British Empire.[CITATION-87] With an Empire-wide plantation-mining complex that was anchored in indenture and its ancillaries, and having already conducted a Parliamentary inquiry that had vindicated the system in British Guiana, both the colonial administration there and the Colonial Office in London were more heavily invested than ever in the indenture system. Defending the legality and morality of indenture, dismissing vehement resistance as the work of unscrupulous agitators, and justifying violent suppression of protests as necessary but unfortunate would, in the decades that followed, become all but second nature to the officials involved.[CITATION-88] Despite all absence of evidence and regardless of Scott\u2019s earlier refutation, Kimberley followed the assertion that Loughran had made in the coroner\u2019s inquest: the potential for a colony-wide revolt under the leadership of seditious \u2018ringleaders\u2019 had, indeed, loomed over the events at Devonshire Castle on that bloody day in September.[CITATION-89] Kimberley passed this interpretation of a nascent rebellion on to the India Office, which had direct responsibility for regulating the global system of Indian indenture at its source.From a district magistrate\u2019s testimony in a far-flung colonial courtroom to the centre of Britain\u2019s imperial edifice, a labour demonstration had been rewritten into a tale of averted rebellion and justifiable killing, the fault for which lay firmly with a few malcontents who had agitated an otherwise docile\u2014but nonethelessviolent\u2014indentured workforce. This explanation rested on judicial and administrative processes that severed the events at Devonshire Castle from the context of ongoing labour resistance and workers\u2019 ubiquitous grievances, linking them instead the 1857 Indian Rebellion, Morant Bay and the history of slave uprisings in the Caribbean. A crucial detail that Kimberley chose not to emphasise in his report was that the judicial test of this interpretation\u2014the trials of the ringleaders held responsible for this incipient revolt\u2014had dramatically failed to inflict the punishment that officials had sought. In an archival record as deep and detailed as that generated by the Devonshire Castle incident, such an elision was easily accomplished.Even as the last of the formal trials of the alleged rebels was concluding, the judgement of public opinion was being brought to bear on the actions of Loughran and his constables. Here, too, the events at Devonshire Castle would be interpreted only in relation to other colonial incidents, moving freely between the contexts of India and Jamaica, and eliciting the spectre of 1857 one moment and that of 1865 the next. John Edward Jenkins, a Liberal politician and author, brought the issue to the attention of metropolitan readers with a strident commentary published by the Londonin November 1872.[CITATION-90] Jenkins, the Mysore-born son of a Methodist minister, had represented the British Benevolent Society on the 1871 British Guiana Commission. In his letter to, he sharply criticised the major press organs of the colony for printing only the \u2018planter\u2019s side of the question\u2019.[CITATION-91] The acrimonious public commentary that followed included letters from the co-owner of the Devonshire Castle plantation (Gordon), the Secretary of the London-based West India Committee (J.H. Ohlson), a former British Guiana magistrate turned anti-slavery activist (Joseph Beaumont), another owner of West India plantations (Alexander Crum-Ewing), and\u2019s editorial staff itself. Each author placed the Devonshire Castle incident in a different historical context, and this choice profoundly shaped their moral interpretation of the indenture system and the violence that had occurred. For Jenkins, the appropriate context was Jamaican Governor Edward John Eyre\u2019s excessive and unjust response to racial discord during the Morant Bay Rebellion.[CITATION-92] For Gordon, the plantation-owner, the events at Devonshire Castle could only be understood as an incipient Indian rebellion with the attendant potential for mayhem.[CITATION-93] Beaumont, the former magistrate, insisted that the moral corrosiveness of an exploitative labour system and the inherent injustice of a society that lived by it were to blame\u2014they were the antithesis of Liberal principles.[CITATION-94] Theeditors, in a similar vein, offered a sharp condemnation of the plantation-indenture system, which they equated with \u2018tyranny and extortion\u2019, warning the planters that moral outrage in England could prompt precipitous abolition of the system and bring about their economic ruin.[CITATION-95] Despite such a clear denunciation, Jenkins himself, in the longest of\u2019s published commentaries, was able to reconcile the abuses of the indenture system with the principles of just governance. The real problem, he asserted, lay with the planters, who obstructed the Colonial Office\u2019s attempts at reform and refused to acknowledge the failings of indenture. Were these issues to be addressed with more interventionist regulation, as Downing Street had strongly advised in a dispatch to Governor Scott shortly before the Devonshire Castle killings, \u2018the immigration of coolies may be made fruitful of good\u2019.[CITATION-96] Such faith in the efficacy of reform would have been cold comfort to the relatives and friends of those shot dead on the road to Devonshire Castle. The killings and the trajectory of the inquest and court cases that followed were, nonetheless, small but perceptible blows to a system whose many tensions, over subsequent decades, would continue to prompt contest and discord. What was most revealing in this case is not the violence inherent in plantation indenture or in imperialism more generally, both of which are familiar to historians of the period.[CITATION-97] Rather, two elements stand out. The first is the long historical shadow cast by the 1857 Indian Rebellion.[CITATION-98] In the official mind and in public discourse, the events of 1857 set the most compelling context for interpreting subsequent discord involving Indian communities across the Empire.[CITATION-99] It dominated interpretations of Indian workers\u2019 collective demonstrations in the Caribbean, serving as a constant reference point for justifying their violent suppression for many decades afterwards.[CITATION-100] The context of 1857 guided not only rationalisations after the fact but, according to their testimony, the behaviour of magistrates, managers and constables during the events themselves.[CITATION-101] This knitting together of two chronologically and geographically disparate events was, however, as much an act of forgetting as it was of remembering. Both the official accounts and subsequent public narrative passed over the long-running labour conflict in the colony and the months of formal grievances, peaceable demonstration, work stoppages and requests for official intervention made by the workers of Devonshire Castle prior to that fatal day in September.The second element worthy of note is how the integration of state control (via magistrates, inspectors, Coroner\u2019s Courts, labour laws) and the management of the indentured plantation labour force helped perpetuate and expand an official narrative that justified a violent state response to incipient rebellion, even when the evidence for the latter was scant in official records. As was demonstrated by the aftermath of the Devonshire Castle killings, this narrative fused the historical contexts of slavery, the plantation complex, indenture and British colonialism in both the Caribbean and India to justify the continuation of a labour system that had prompted widespread abuses and fomented discontent across the population allegedly being uplifted by it.[CITATION-102] In this process, the state\u2019s collusion with planters and managers in the suppression of workers\u2019 rights and the state\u2019s violent response to workers\u2019 demonstrations appeared as an aberrant by-product of indenture, wholly accounted for by Indians\u2019 seditious tendencies, and consonant with Liberalism and moral colonial rule. Magistrates and managers played key roles in creating this official narrative, which operated reflexively by providing a compelling context for officials to draw on in justifying repressive measures against subsequent demonstrations. Indenture, by melding the power of the colonial state with systems of plantation labour management, had substantially increased the power of both entities.At the same time, the fusion of the colonial state and plantation labour management had opened up new avenues of resistance. Local officials were often either themselves part of the plantation system or closely aligned with its owners. The institutions they administered, local courts most predominantly, worked hand in glove to control plantation workers by law when possible and by force and violence when thought necessary. Ostensibly, such agents and institutions were also the mediators of labour relations and the guarantors of workers\u2019 rights. Workers\u2019 efforts to engage with this system on their own terms, asserting their own vision of justice, were rarely successful, and local officials were diligent in the dismissal and delegitimising of such claims. But as they were carried out through official channels and in public venues, in contrast to the more informal processes of conflict resolution that had predominated prior to 1834, labourers\u2019 encounters with the state became part of the official record and sometimes appeared in public accounts as well.To critics of indenture, as well as to the workers themselves, the fusion of law and labour management made the injustices of the system clearly visible and implicated colonial governance itself in the abuse of labourers\u2019 rights as Crown subjects. Therefore, the violent suppression of workers and the subsequent reconciliation of that violence with Liberal principles and a moral discourse of law and order\u2014 which was largely conducted by local officials or by higher administrators on the basis of the former\u2019s ground-level accounts\u2014helped undermine both indenture and the colonial state alike. The obvious collusion between state and plantation inadvertently created a focus for resistance by a broad array of cohorts in Guyanese society, including the Portuguese middling classes, humanitarian activists and reform-minded judges and administrators. Most visibly, the central role played by magistrates and their courts in these measures gave credence to repeated claims by indentured labourers that the entire colonial justice system was a tool of oppression. In a vicious cycle, magistrates\u2019 positions at the forefront of repressive measures discouraged labourers from addressing their grievances through the judiciary, making direct resistance through work stoppages and mass demonstrations more appealing and setting the stage for more violent clashes.[CITATION-103] The Devonshire Castle incident was merely one of a series of confrontations between indentured labourers and local police forces that would occur across the breadth of Britain\u2019s global indenture system, from the Caribbean to Mauritius to Malaysia, in the decades that followed. Each one would prompt its own trials and inquests. These incidents and their aftermath would provide, in official discourse, reflexive justification for the system\u2019s stern response to disorder.[CITATION-104] In the light of official and public scrutiny, they also revealed the abuses endemic to the system and fuelled the growing chorus of critics who would combine their condemnation of indenture with censure of the local, colonial and empire-wide systems of law and governance that facilitated it.[CITATION-105] For the post-emancipation empire, where racial equality before the law was constantly preached, if often not practiced, indenture and the state\u2019s involvement in the suppression of workers that accompanied it became one of the most blatant examples of the fundamental contradictions inherent in colonial governance. As Mohandas Gandhi wrote in 1916, during his long campaign for repeal of the system, the \u2018artificial state of indentured service\u2019 exaggerated the \u2018unnatural relationship\u2019 of inequality between Englishmen and Indians well beyond the way their relations in India itself did.[CITATION-106] The rampant iniquities of the system prompted a steady stream of public criticism and legal challenges from humanitarians, anti-slavery campaigners, judicial contrarians and Indian activists that grew in volume across the decades preceding the First World War. Their opposition often explicitly referenced the gnawing, low-level resistance on the part of workers themselves, for whom the brutality and injustice of indenture were all too apparent. The official narrative of indenture\u2019s civilising mission notwithstanding, workers\u2019 frequent contestations of the system could not be erased from the official record, nor could the cumulative political impact of their actions and the state\u2019s often violent reaction be ignored.[CITATION-107] Efforts by officials in London and the Empire to reconcile, on the one hand, Liberalism, moral colonisation, safeguarding subjects\u2019 rights, and the \u2018rule of law\u2019 and, on the other, the violations of all of these principles in the violent suppression of labour disturbances among the indentured workforce proved increasingly problematic as the decades wore on.[CITATION-108] Seen in this light, the deaths of Maxidally, Kaulica, Baldeo, Beccaroo and Auckloo on a plantation road in British Guiana were not a coda, but a prelude. The Devonshire Castle incident presaged the centrifugal forces of popular demonstration, violent suppression, moral condemnation and administrative exhaustion that would prove instrumental in the end of indenture fifty years later."

    "title": "Ulster Unionist Political Thought in the Era of the Northern Ireland Troubles, 1968\u20131998*",

    "text": "This article examines Ulster Unionist political thought, in its widest sense, against the backdrop of the Northern Ireland Troubles. During this period, Ulster Unionists sought to resist nationalist and republican arguments for the unification of Ireland and to articulate their position to supporters and wider audiences. As Direct Rule from London followed the suspension of the unionist-dominated Northern Ireland parliament at Stormont in 1972 and its abolition the following year, internal unionist debate intensified over the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. Defining Ulster Unionism broadly, at a time when its organisational forms were proliferating, the article considers the Ulster Unionist Party and its offshoot Vanguard, as well as the Democratic Unionist Party and the paramilitary organisations, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association, and their affiliated political bodies. The article analyses, in turn, the four competing unionist visions of the future: a return to majority-rule devolution; independence; closer integration with Great Britain; and power-sharing devolution. Not attempting a detailed consideration of the policy proposals, the article instead explores the connections forged between Ulster Unionist political ideas, some of them of long pedigree, and wider debates. It shows that, at a time of considerable change for the United Kingdom, Ulster Unionist argument reflected\u2014much more than is currently understood, and sometimes in a pronounced form\u2014a wide range of interconnected contemporary British disputes. These not only concerned the constitution, nationality and sovereignty, but also permissiveness, political parties, decline, the end of empire, Thatcherism and European integration.It is easy to dismiss the study of Ulster Unionist political thought. There is, without doubt, a \u2018resilient popular image of unionism as essentially anti- or non-intellectual\u2019.[CITATION-1] It is also difficult to identify any \u2018great thinkers\u2019 or noted texts. Yet a different picture emerges if a wider definition of political thought is employed\u2014one that analyses the intellectual arguments made in certain political contexts.[CITATION-2] During the bloody conflict known as the Troubles that ran from the late 1960s to the late 1990s, Ulster Unionists were under considerable pressure not just to resist nationalist and republican arguments for the unification of Ireland but also to articulate their own position, especially to their own supporters as well as increasingly to wider audiences. In these circumstances, internal Ulster Unionist political argument intensified over the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. As Direct Rule from London was introduced following the suspension of the unionist-dominated Northern Ireland parliament at Stormont in 1972 and its abolition the following year, Ulster Unionists called variously for a return to majority-rule devolution, some degree of independence, closer integration with Great Britain, or devolution with some provision for power sharing. While these basic positions are familiar, the ways in which Ulster Unionists argued for them\u2014drawing, in some cases, on established unionist ideas but also setting them against a surprisingly wide range of contemporary British debates\u2014remain obscure.The intellectual history of Northern Irish politics has, until relatively recently, received little attention. Partly, this is because the history of political thought has been slow to develop as far as the study of Ireland is concerned.[CITATION-3] It is also because interpretations of the causes of the Troubles, which have been the central preoccupation in studies of recent Northern Irish history, have pointed in different directions. A powerful and enduring explanation has labelled the Troubles a \u2018religious conflict\u2019, with the sociologist Steve Bruce\u2014who studied Ian Paisley and the wider influence of his Protestant evangelical views\u2014providing arguably the most explicit statement of this perspective in the mid-1980s.[CITATION-4] Bruce argued that Ulster Protestants were an \u2018ethnic group\u2019, and by the 1990s it had become commonplace to characterise the whole dispute as an \u2018ethnic war\u2019 between culturally defined and self-consciously differentiated communities.[CITATION-5] Richard Bourke was, therefore, going against the grain of much writing on the Troubles when, in 2003, he emphasised the importance of ideas and argued that in Northern Ireland \u2018the prime issue in contention was the core value of democracy\u2019, linked to interpretations of self-determination.[CITATION-6] In this analysis, the Ulster Unionist emphasis on the constitutional wishes of the majority in Northern Ireland was consistently pitted against the primacy given by nationalists to the preferences of a majority in Ireland as a whole.[CITATION-7] Despite this, it is still the case, as Colin W. Reid put it in 2017, that there has been \u2018little work on unionist political ideas\u2019.[CITATION-8] The omission is particularly striking for the later part of the twentieth century. As internal debate within unionism escalated, its organisational forms proliferated. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which had controlled the Northern Ireland government between 1921 and 1972, continued to be the largest unionist party, but it now visibly fractured. The Vanguard Movement, flirting with independence, emerged as a pressure group within the UUP in 1972 and broke away to form the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party the following year. In the 1980s, factional groups within the UUP supporting devolution or integration assumed institutional identities, most notably the Campaign for Equal Citizenship endorsing electoral integration\u2014that is, British political party organisation in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, Paisley\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), formed in 1971, consistently challenged the UUP as it tried to position itself as the most strongly pro-majority-rule devolution party. Paramilitary organisations, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), formed in 1966 and 1971 respectively, also entered the debates over independence and power sharing, sometimes through affiliated political groups. Besides disagreeing among themselves, unionists also faced evolving challenges from Irish Nationalists. The constitutional nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had been established in 1970, and in the early 1980s Sinn F\u00e9in, the political wing of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), entered electoral politics in the aftermath of the hunger strikes of 1980 and 1981. All the while, unionists were under pressure from successive British governments, Conservative and Labour alike, to agree to the re-establishment of devolution on a power-sharing basis and to accept the involvement of the Republic of Ireland in resolving the conflict.[CITATION-9] This was, in broad terms, the basis of the short-lived 1973 Sunningdale Agreement, with the Republic\u2019s consultative role institutionalised in the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement and the more enduring 1998 Good Friday Agreement. At the same time, it is important to appreciate the intractability of the conflict for much of the period.[CITATION-10] Some of the characteristics of Ulster Unionism have been valuably illuminated in literature that sets the background for this article. Ulster Unionism evolved from Irish Unionism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, stressing a commitment to the British Empire and the economic benefits of the 1800 Act of Union.[CITATION-11] During debates over Irish Home Rule, which reached a climax between 1912 and 1914, a distinct \u2018Ulster identity\u2019 developed, involving a celebration of the seventeenth-century Plantation and linking \u2018Protestant Ulster\u2019 to some extent with Presbyterianism.[CITATION-12] Although Ulster Unionism had emerged in order to resist Home Rule, after the creation of Northern Ireland in 1921 it became deeply committed to the maintenance of the Stormont parliament.[CITATION-13] Ulster Unionism was attached to the monarchy and celebrated a commitment to civil and religious liberty, dating back to the 1688 Glorious Revolution, whose protection was the declared mission of the Orange Order, the fraternal Protestant organisation.[CITATION-14] Ulster Unionism has been defined by David W. Miller as demonstrating a conditional (sometimes called contractarian) loyalty to Britain, although it is clear that this applies to Scottish Unionism as well.[CITATION-15] In the mid-1980s the political scientist Jennifer Todd delineated a distinction between Ulster loyalist and British unionist perspectives which, while valuable, has been criticised for not fully appreciating the overlapping identities and divisions within the categories.[CITATION-16] In a widely read overview, J.J. Lee castigated Ulster Unionism for its \u2018supremacist\u2019 outlook in the years before 1972, but it is now recognised that fear, isolation and vulnerability characterised Ulster Unionism in the later twentieth century.[CITATION-17] This article considers Ulster Unionism broadly, examining the positions adopted by the political parties and the paramilitaries. Its source base is drawn from the extensive pamphlet literature in which unionists set out their arguments, held in the Northern Ireland Political Collection at the Linen Hall Library in Belfast as well as political speeches and party material held at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland. These have been supplemented by material from the UK and Irish National Archives and from some private papers. The article itself is divided into four thematic sections, each moving chronologically and examining the competing unionist visions of Northern Ireland\u2019s future: majority-rule devolution, independence, integration, and power-sharing devolution. It does not attempt a detailed consideration of the policy proposals. Instead, against the backdrop of the Troubles, the article explores connections forged between Ulster Unionist political ideas and wider debates.Twenty-five years ago, Ian McBride argued that Ulster Unionism\u2014often seen as \u2018irrational, backward and deviant\u2019\u2014actually \u2018reveals, in heightened form, problematic questions about nationality and sovereignty which are rooted in the structure of the United Kingdom itself\u2019.[CITATION-18] McBride was writing in a context where, with Linda Colley making a central contribution, discussion of the erosion of \u2018Britishness\u2019 was rife in academic circles (despite at the same time gaining increased prominence in contemporary public life).[CITATION-19] While McBride\u2019s argument was perceptive, it has remained untested by a detailed examination of Ulster Unionist political argument. Such an examination shows that the scope of unionist political thinking was wider than nationality and sovereignty\u2014though these themes emerged in some under-appreciated ways. In attempting to secure endorsement for various constitutional proposals, Ulster Unionist thought also reflected other key anxieties facing the UK in the later twentieth century in social, economic, political and international terms, including interlinked arguments over permissiveness, political parties, decline, the end of empire, Thatcherism and European integration.Until 1972, Ulster Unionism as a whole was \u2018characterised by its commitment to the existing provisions for majority rule\u2019 in Northern Ireland, with the party possessing a majority able to form a government and seats contested on a first-past-the-post constituency basis as they were at Westminster.[CITATION-20] Brian Faulkner, the Northern Ireland prime minister in 1971\u20132, argued that \u2018the meaning, however hard, of democracy\u2019 was that \u2018the will of the majority must decide fundamental issues\u2019.[CITATION-21] This was also the view of those unionists, such as Ian Paisley, the founder of the Free Presbyterian Church, who criticised the Northern Ireland government for being too willing to bow to pressure for reform from London.[CITATION-22] Significantly, this was a time when the existing understanding (which the devolved administration at Stormont had complicated since the 1920s) that the UK was a unitary state, with all power flowing from the centre, was coming under scrutiny.[CITATION-23] In this context, Ulster Unionists had given some thought as to why devolution remained desirable\u2014assuming that it would continue to be majority rule. Giving evidence to the Royal Commission on the Constitution, set up to examine the structure of the UK amid the rise of Scottish and Welsh nationalism, the Ulster Unionist Council (UUC), the UUP\u2019s governing body, emphasised the provincial parliament\u2019s ability \u2018to reflect in legislation the particular moral opinions of the people of the region\u2019 on issues such as divorce and abortion.[CITATION-24] This related to discussions about extending the 1967 Abortion Act to Northern Ireland and responses to the 1969 Divorce Reform Act, which had made divorces easier to obtain in England and Wales. These were legislative expressions of the broader trend of permissiveness, which was particularly associated with youth and concerned the loosening of long-standing sexual and moral restraints. It is tempting to see the Ulster Unionist opposition to these changes as reflecting a conservative Protestant viewpoint, but, in recent years, historians have emphasised that conservative attitudes persisted to a significant extent across the UK.[CITATION-25] After the suspension of Stormont, these views continued to underpin the UUP position as it called for a return to majority-rule devolution\u2014albeit now backed by a multi-party committee system.[CITATION-26] Advocacy of majority-rule devolution soon passed to the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC). This was an electoral coalition\u2014endorsed by the Orange Order and comprising the UUP (calling itself the Official Unionist Party), the DUP and the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party\u2014set up in early 1974 to channel unionist opposition to the Sunningdale Agreement that envisaged a power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive and a cross-border Council of Ireland. The UUUC was thus pitted against the pro-agreement parties making up the Executive: those unionists supporting Faulkner (who had been forced to resign as UUP leader), the SDLP and the cross-community Alliance Party. With the Royal Commission on the Constitution (chaired by Lord Kilbrandon in its later stages) having reported in autumn 1973 and recommended devolution for Scotland and Wales on the basis of majority rule, the UUUC argued for a Northern Ireland settlement along the same lines.[CITATION-27] Despite taking evidence from Northern Ireland while Stormont was still in operation, the Commission had refrained from offering any recommendations for its system of government\u2014amid a volatile situation and under British government pressure not to jeopardise the movement towards power sharing.[CITATION-28] In April 1974, the UUUC committed itself to support for devolution in Northern Ireland within a future federal UK.[CITATION-29] Federalism technically involved dividing, not devolving, power between Westminster and regional governments, but the UUUC was not alone in defining it loosely as a type of devolution.[CITATION-30] Events now moved quickly, with the Ulster Workers\u2019 Council (UWC) strike in May 1974, with UUUC support, bringing down the Executive and then preparations beginning for the ill-fated 1975 Constitutional Convention. The situation was a complex one. The strikers argued that it was not power sharing they opposed but the involvement of Dublin.[CITATION-31] Nevertheless, as the Convention approached, the UUUC once again called for \u2018a system of government broadly in line with the provisions to be made for constitutional devolution in the United Kingdom as a whole\u2019.[CITATION-32] At the same time, the ways in which the UUUC made its case developed significantly. In 1974 it had argued frankly that \u2018no Political Party at Westminster wishes to stand in the way of the unification of Ireland let alone positively seek to maintain the union between Ulster and the rest of the UK\u2019.[CITATION-33] Since the 1920s, the UUP MPs had taken the Conservative whip at Westminster in return for administrative, electoral and financial help. The relationship had weakened considerably by the 1960s, but there was still unionist dismay at the Conservative government\u2019s decision to suspend Stormont and impose Direct Rule \u2018without taking its party colleagues in Northern Ireland into confidence and consultation\u2019.[CITATION-34] Increasingly, the UUUC argued that party interests dominated the actions of Westminster politicians. As the UUP leader Harry West made clear in 1976, this related particularly to the view that Labour, and its leader Harold Wilson, made sympathetic noises about a united Ireland because of its electoral value in certain British constituencies with high concentrations of people from the Republic of Ireland (who were given the right to vote and otherwise treated as British citizens).[CITATION-35] The Labour-leaning inclinations of Irish Catholic voters in Britain were readily apparent.[CITATION-36] Yet the argument was wider than this. In one sense, it was built on Irish Protestant fears, dating back to the early modern period, of English treachery, which had become pronounced during the debates over Home Rule as their dependence on Britain was made evident.[CITATION-37] The argument also chimed with a growing public and media dissatisfaction with the British political system and its institutions, especially political parties, characterised by scepticism about politicians\u2019 motives, which had begun to develop in the 1950s and gathered pace in the 1970s and 1980s.[CITATION-38] Calls for majority-rule devolution not only included accusations that a \u2018low standard of integrity prevailed in public life\u2019 at Westminster but were also sometimes accompanied by a condemnation of Direct Rule as \u2018colonial\u2019\u2014as in the case of the UUP politician Austin Ardill.[CITATION-39] The term colonial was used to mean undemocratic control over Northern Ireland by Britain and did not carry the connotations of colonisation, involving the displacement and subordination of earlier inhabitants. Yet, in suggesting that the colonial experience was a negative one, its use was arguably a particular expression of British unease at coming to terms with the imperial past.[CITATION-40] It was especially striking not only because Ulster Unionists had earlier embraced an imperial identity but also because criticisms of British rule as colonial had previously been advanced from nationalist and republican perspectives. Nationalists and republicans often viewed northern Protestants as a settler-colonial group\u2014an interpretation with some merit until the nineteenth century but of less value for the more recent period. At the time of the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, Irish Nationalists had reiterated the established argument that Ireland was not a colony but instead a nation because of the assumption that colonies would become self-governing dominions rather than fully independent states. But by the 1970s, with widespread European decolonisation, the term colonial was used to imply illegitimacy and to suggest that thewould not last.[CITATION-41] This shift in interpretation was also intertwined with internal debates within the republican movement after 1969. While the Official IRA emphasised class struggle, the Provisionals criticised the \u2018colonial\u2019 nature of Northern Ireland where, as they saw it, the main problem was a duplicitous Britain whose \u2018imperial\u2019 political and economic interests benefited from the existing arrangements.[CITATION-42] After the collapse of the UUUC in 1977, with devolution in Scotland and Wales rejected by referenda in 1979 and the UUP divided between integrationist and devolutionist wings, the DUP continued to call for majority-rule devolution, linked to a charge against permissiveness. Paisley had recently launched his \u2018Save Ulster from Sodomy\u2019 campaign to prevent the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (which had been done in England and Wales in 1967) on the basis that the Bible condemned homosexuality as a sin. Calling for an end to the \u2018colonial type system of \u201cDirect Rule\u201d\u2019, the DUP\u2019s 1979 General Election manifesto now proclaimed its \u2018strong stand in accordance with Christian principles on the great moral issues of our day\u2019.[CITATION-43] The DUP was not alone in making these arguments, with, for example, the UUP MP for South Belfast, Robert Bradford, also doing so.[CITATION-44] But the DUP was the prominent voice\u2014and this continued to be the case when the Thatcher government was in power. The DUP manifesto for the 1982 Assembly Election, an attempt by the British government to restart devolution, railed against \u2018the imposition by Westminster of alien moral standards upon Ulster\u2019 and asserted that \u2018Ulster should decide its own moral standards and codes of behaviour\u2019.[CITATION-45] In the event, male homosexuality in adults over 21 was legalised in Northern Ireland in 1982, following a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights. Even so, it should be recognised that the DUP\u2019s position was not that far from the manner in which, during the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher and some of those around her had\u2014from a Christian perspective\u2014identified themselves with existing discontent about aspects of the permissive society.[CITATION-46] Yet, at the same time, the DUP was sharply critical of other parts of Thatcher\u2019s domestic agenda. Leaning to the left on socio-economic issues since its formation, the DUP was in the tradition of independent unionists who, since the inter-war period, had been critical of both Stormont and Westminster for not doing enough to reduce unemployment.[CITATION-47] Now, in 1982, as the Thatcher government prioritised low inflation from a monetarist perspective, Paisley lamented the fact that UK unemployment was \u2018soaring\u2019 to 3 million, adding that the \u2018Government\u2019s running down of our hospitals must be halted\u2019.[CITATION-48] At the DUP conference in 1984 Paisley criticised the government\u2019s \u2018unprecedented attack upon the foundations of the welfare state\u2019 and its decision to increase expenditure taxes that worked to \u2018take from the mouth of labour the bread it has so strenuously earned\u2019.[CITATION-49] Despite its rhetorical attack on the welfare state, in practice the Thatcher government largely left it intact and actually emphasised its commitment to the NHS.[CITATION-50] The Thatcher government had, however, reduced income tax, especially at the higher levels, and had increased the rate of VAT. The points about welfare were powerful ones to make because, in the years after 1945, the Ulster Unionist government in Northern Ireland had been ready to identify the Union with the \u2018full benefits of the welfare state\u2019.[CITATION-51] Indeed, within the UUP there was some acknowledgement of the DUP positioning and its potential electoral appeal.[CITATION-52] This was especially striking as the most forthright calls from the UUP for majority-rule devolution at this time came from Edgar Graham, a law academic at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, who\u2014in stark contrast to the DUP\u2014struck a Thatcherite chord himself, calling for economic policies designed to foster \u2018the business and entrepreneurial spirit of its people\u2019.[CITATION-53] The DUP continued to dominate calls for majority-rule devolution in the years ahead, but there was a substantial change in the arguments underpinning its position as the party responded to the end of the Cold War and especially to the debate over increased European integration. In 1993, the DUP asserted the \u2018right of the Ulster people to self-determination\u2019, including \u2018by means of a referendum\u2019.[CITATION-54] The Charter Group, which had emerged within the UUP after the Anglo-Irish Agreement and which called for majority-rule devolution, had similarly argued in 1987 that the \u2018Unionist case for self-determination is a just one\u2019.[CITATION-55] Yet in recent years the resort to self-determination had not been a core part of the case for majority-rule devolution. At the start of the twentieth century, both Ulster Unionists and Irish Nationalists had committed themselves to competing interpretations of self-determination, which rose to particular prominence during the First World War under the influence of the US President Woodrow Wilson. In the unionist case, the original importance attributed to the self-determination of the UK as a whole was soon replaced by an emphasis on the wishes of a majority in Ulster. By the start of the Troubles, amid widespread decolonisation, the prevailing international interpretation of self-determination related to peoples inhabiting a pre-existing territory, and this was usually taken to mean the island of Ireland. However, in the 1990s, the break-up of both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia challenged this assumption.[CITATION-56] In this context, the call for self-determination was linked to opposition to British membership of the European Community on the basis that it challenged British sovereignty. The argument about sovereignty had a substantial lineage, stretching back to the early 1960s and the UK\u2019s first application for membership, and coming from those, mainly in the Conservative Party but also from the Labour Party, concerned with the threat to Westminster\u2019s parliamentary sovereignty from European political union.[CITATION-57] From 1969, Enoch Powell, the Conservative and Ulster Unionist politician, had been the best-known proponent of this view.[CITATION-58] But it remained relatively marginal until the late 1980s, when Thatcher began to argue against the creation of a \u2018European super-state\u2019, stimulating concerns about sovereignty in a growing body of \u2018Eurosceptic\u2019 opinion in the Conservative Party and in the pressure group the Anti-Federalist League, which later became the UK Independence Party (UKIP).[CITATION-59] The DUP itself had a pedigree on the argument about sovereignty. It had articulated such concerns during the 1975 referendum on European Community membership, but these were, to some extent, obscured by the virulence of Paisley\u2019s criticism of the Community as a Catholic force and a correspondingly potent threat to Protestantism.[CITATION-60] In its 1979 General Election manifesto, the DUP warned against \u2018the extension of its [the European Community\u2019s] powers at the expense of our national sovereignty\u2019.[CITATION-61] Like others, the DUP saw a particular danger arising from the Maastricht Treaty for increased political and monetary union, which was negotiated in 1991 and enacted in 1993 with the formation of the EU. The party endorsed the growing call for a referendum on the treaty on the basis of the UK\u2019s \u2018right of self-determination\u2019, and subsequently linked this to its commitment to self-determination for Northern Ireland. Put together, these offered a means of preventing the \u2018double degradation of submission to Dublin rule \u2026 and to the thumbscrew of the EU\u2019.[CITATION-62] From a British government perspective, Northern Ireland independence and British withdrawal was, as the then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, put it in 1974, \u2018unmentionable\u2019.[CITATION-63] In Ulster Unionist politics, independence was advanced out of the fractious politics of the UUP, with William Craig playing the prominent role but with a degree of ambiguity over whether he wanted independence or a type of federation.[CITATION-64] As a Stormont minister in the mid- and late 1960s, his calls for federation were not that far from what Terence O\u2019Neill, as Northern Ireland prime minister, sometimes advocated. But Craig\u2019s support for Ian Smith\u2019s White-dominated government in Rhodesia\u2014which made a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965 as the UK refused to move it to independence without majority, that is, Black, rule\u2014was more provocative, and was indeed a glimpse of the settler-colonial perspective. In the event, O\u2019Neill dismissed Craig as Minister of Home Affairs in late 1968 because of, among other things, his \u2018attraction to ideas of a UDI nature\u2019.[CITATION-65] In February 1971, writing in the prominent Belfast current affairs magazine, Craig renewed his call for a \u2018British Federation\u2019 that would include the Republic of Ireland. In one sense this looked back to the nineteenth century, when ideas of federalism for the whole UK had attracted support from both nationalist and unionist politicians as a means of resisting the centralisation of political power at Westminster, only to fade after 1880 as debates over Home Rule focused increasingly on Ireland.[CITATION-66] But Craig\u2019s case for \u2018constitutional changes\u2019 also related to current debates over Scotland and Wales. He argued that \u2018the inadequacy of the National Parliament at Westminster and the growing discontent throughout the Kingdom\u2019 could be alleviated by the more effective democracy of \u2018regional Parliaments\u2019. Crucially, Craig contended that the \u2018discontent \u2026 will soon identify itself with the growing sense of Britain\u2019s failure internationally\u2019.[CITATION-67] He thus set his argument within the pervasive and wide-ranging debate about British \u2018decline\u2019. From the late 1950s, calls from the Left to tackle economic decline (relative in fact) through economic planning had attracted substantial attention.[CITATION-68] The argument subsequently broadened out, with the Conservative right-wing pressure group the Monday Club, which Craig later joined, making a distinctive contribution. Established in 1961 to resist the decolonisation that it saw as engendering Britain\u2019s international decline, the club also strongly identified with the Rhodesian UDI\u2014although, so far as the UK was concerned, it sought to maintain the territorial integrity of the state, with some of its members later supporting integration for Northern Ireland.[CITATION-69] From February 1972, advocacy of greater independence for Ulster was intertwined with the emergence of Craig\u2019s Vanguard Movement. Set up just before the suspension of Stormont, Vanguard\u2019s constitution spoke of bolstering \u2018the Parliament of Northern Ireland\u2019, but Craig soon went further, arguing that he favoured \u2018some form of friendly Dominion status under the Crown\u2019 if remaining in the UK proved impossible.[CITATION-70] The term \u2018Dominion\u2019 had signified semi-independence within the British Empire, being widely used until the end of the Second World War to denote Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Irish Free State. The use of the term diminished thereafter amid the emergence of the British Commonwealth as an association of free and equal former members of the Empire, with the British monarch as its symbolic head. Yet in Northern Ireland, the Stormont MP W.F. McCoy emerged as a powerful advocate of dominion status in the years after 1945, making loud calls for greater fiscal independence.[CITATION-71] Now, in the 1970s, it was Kennedy Lindsay who did the most to advance the case for independence in the form of dominion status. Born in Canada but brought up in Northern Ireland, Lindsay was a historian who had most recently been associated with London University\u2019s Institute of Commonwealth Studies. In April 1972, he had first come into contact with Craig, who asked him to write a Vanguard pamphlet concerned with the economics of dominion status.[CITATION-72] In, Lindsay set his arguments in the context of the development of the Commonwealth, but academic assessments of his assertion of the economic viability of an independent Ulster have been understandably critical.[CITATION-73] Lindsay recognised that redistributed resources from Westminster were \u2018substantial sums\u2019, but insisted that several \u2018small countries, with resources no greater than Ulster, are surviving comfortably without financial subventions\u2019.[CITATION-74] Lindsay did not, moreover, say anything about the level of welfare\u2014mirroring earlier calls for dominion status that had been silent on the issue.What was arguably more significant, however, was Lindsay\u2019s opposition to an independent Ulster being in the European Community. Before moving back to Northern Ireland, Lindsay had lived in England and been a member of the British Labour Party, applying to be a parliamentary candidate in 1970 and identifying opposition to UK membership of the European Community as one of his central beliefs, on the basis that it \u2018would be disastrous for Britain both in the short and the long term\u2019.[CITATION-75] At this point, Labour was more divided over the issue than the Conservatives who\u2014in government since 1970\u2014had negotiated UK entry into the Community, which was set to take place at the start of 1973. Now, citing the work of the Labour-supporting Cambridge University economist Nicholas Kaldor, Lindsay argued that membership would entail a higher cost of living and production\u2014arguments that became increasingly prevalent in Labour circles.[CITATION-76] Lindsay\u2019s opposition to Community membership had an influence on Craig, who asked him to take a leading role in the research and publicity for Vanguard. Having previously held that membership of the European Community was \u2018not really a consideration\u2019, Craig now contended that Northern Ireland should assert its right to self-determination to claim independence in order to benefit from increased trade with the Commonwealth, making it explicit that this involved being \u2018[o]utside the Common Market\u2019.[CITATION-77] Craig did not substantiate his point about the European Community, shared by some in the Monday Club, but it did represent a significant challenge to the prevalent view that Community membership was necessary to take advantage of shifts in the UK\u2019s trade away from the Commonwealth and towards Western Europe.The following year, Craig made an argument about allegiance\u2014arguably the central question in unionist thought. He suggested that an independent dominion would be held together by \u2018allegiance to Ulster with its own distinctive heritage and way of life\u2019. Craig did not go into further detail and kept his language vague, but his rationale was that \u2018We cannot think of owing any allegiance to an Irish Republic no matter how it is restructured. Others can\u2019t think of owing loyalty to Britain\u2019. Craig did, admittedly, see the dominion as \u2018resting on its British Heritage\u2019, but he stressed that he sought to overcome religious divides, creating \u2018an Ulster where a man\u2019s religion is only his own and God\u2019s concern\u2019, and called on \u2018Ulster Protestants and Ulster Roman Catholics\u2019 to recognise how much they had \u2018in common with each other\u2019. Craig\u2019s speech was notable for his tentative willingness to consider temporary power sharing\u2014amid short-lived discussions between Craig and the SDLP\u2014but it also generated a backlash from Faulkner, who argued that Ulster independence was \u2018absolutely contrary\u2019 to unionism, prompting Craig to leave the UUP and form the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party[CITATION-78] Craig\u2019s arguments had academic antecedents. In 1971, the social scientist Richard Rose had argued that \u2018Protestants and Catholics within the province might feel more of a community of interest with each other \u2026 than with their neighbours\u2019 in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland.[CITATION-79] Furthermore, the basic premise of Craig\u2019s argument had already been tried out in political debate. In 1972, Fergus McAteer, who had been involved in the civil rights movement and was the son of the Nationalist Party leader Eddie McAteer, argued that it was possible to find \u2018common ground\u2019 between nationalists and unionists through their commitment to Ulster.[CITATION-80] Yet in practice Vanguard did not pursue the implications\u2014including the question of whether Ulster was a nation. The pamphletdid not actually make the claim stated in its title.[CITATION-81] At one level, it is difficult to disagree with the sociologist Sarah Nelson\u2019s assessment that Vanguard lacked \u2018a clear picture of that Ulster identity that would underpin independence\u2019, but at the same time it is necessary to appreciate that national identities have often been formed by a sense of the other.[CITATION-82] Moreover, the question of whether Ulster Unionism was itself a form of nationalism continues to preoccupy historians.[CITATION-83] From 1974, the politics of the UUUC pushed the idea of federation\u2014as opposed to independence\u2014to the forefront among those associated with Vanguard. David Trimble, then a law lecturer at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and chair of the North Down Vanguard Association, announced his support for a \u2018Community of the British Isles\u2019 as a \u2018loose federation\u2019.[CITATION-84] Lindsay was also prominent here\u2014and indeed he had, from late 1972, wanted to establish \u2018more formal contacts\u2019 with Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party so that they could \u2018reinforce one another in the struggle to reduce exploitation of the regions of the United Kingdom by London and the South-East\u2019.[CITATION-85] Lindsay\u2019s point resonated because Scottish Nationalists were beginning to argue for independence from a left-wing perspective that was opposed to control from London and the forces of market capitalism.[CITATION-86] Plaid Cymru also embraced the economic ideas of the Left.[CITATION-87] Yet it was Lindsay\u2019s own publicthat was most apparent when, in early 1974, he stated: \u2018I look forward to a federal United Kingdom with subordinate parliaments in England, Scotland, Wales and Ulster\u2019.[CITATION-88] With Craig marginalised in unionist circles after supporting \u2018voluntary\u2019 power sharing with the SDLP in the summer of 1975, and Lindsay continuing to vacillate between support for independence and for federation, the momentum behind the independence debate moved elsewhere.[CITATION-89] Under the influence of Glenn Barr, the Vanguard deputy leader and a UDA brigadier, the UDA leadership endorsed \u2018some form of independence for Ulster\u2019 in March 1975.[CITATION-90] There was briefly interest in Ulster independence on the part of some within the SDLP leadership, and the issue was discussed at a high-profile workshop at the Corrymeela Community\u2014a community committed to Christian reconciliation\u2014in 1976.[CITATION-91] A paper suggesting power sharing within an independent Ulster produced by the Ulster Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee (ULCCC), which had been formed after the UWC strike as a forum for loyalist paramilitary organisations, was considered at the meeting. The ULCCC initially included the UDA (though it soon left) as well as the UVF and its linked organisation the Red Hand Commando. Following Craig\u2019s earlier line, the committee argued for a \u2018\u2019 as a means by which to \u2018solve the cause of the conflict once and for all\u2019. Where the committee\u2019s contribution was more distinctive, however, was in adopting a free-market position on economics at the very time when Thatcher, elected as Conservative leader in 1975, was arguing that it provided a way of combating economic decline. Influenced by Trimble, who had worked closely with the paramilitaries during the UWC strike, and by the Queen\u2019s University economist John Simpson, the committee contended that an \u2018independent Ulster would have a totally different tax structure to that of Westminster: more along the lines of the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, a financial structure which would encourage \u201cbig money\u201d into the country\u2019\u2014provided it had access to the European Community. Where earlier advocates of independence had avoided the issue, the committee\u2014in line with the Thatcherite attack on the dependency culture\u2014announced its desire to take \u2018a new look at Social Security which would deal with the work dodgers and layabouts\u2019. It proposed \u2018in the first instance, to have a \u201cgovernment of all the talents\u201d in which every substantial grouping prepared to try and make the independent state work, would be invited to take part\u2019. Yet it held that this would be temporary, lasting only until \u2018disputes over the distribution of goods and services within the new state\u2019 came to the fore and facilitated \u2018the development of a new political structure on left/right lines\u2019.[CITATION-92] Calls for independence receded from the mid-1970s as broader trends worked against the idea. Most notably, British government strategy, particularly under Labour after 1974, involved an increasing financial subvention to Northern Ireland that sought to reduce violence.[CITATION-93] Independence proposals, with a nod towards some form of power sharing, from the New Ulster Political Research Group (NUPRG), which was linked to the UDA and chaired by Barr, briefly gained attention in 1979, especially after they were given the title.[CITATION-94] It was not, however, until after the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement that debates over independence re-entered the foreground of Northern Irish politics. In this context the DUP assumed the prominent role and underpinned its position with an attack on Thatcher, whose economic and social policies it also opposed. The DUP had tentatively toyed with independence in the early 1980s, fearing \u2018betrayal\u2019 as the Thatcher government entered dialogue with the Republic of Ireland.[CITATION-95] Now Paisley lashed out at Thatcher, reworking the contractarian argument with a religious inflection. Speaking at a press conference at his own Martyr\u2019s Memorial Church in Belfast in June 1986, Paisley announced a \u2018campaign of political dissent on behalf of his church\u2019. He argued that the \u2018Thatcher regime\u2019 should \u2018no longer be recognised by Free Presbyterians as a proper and legitimate government\u2019, stressing that \u2018Loyalty to the Queen was not affected because Margaret Thatcher is simply a dictator\u2019\u2014she and her ministers were \u2018usurpers with no God-given authority\u2019.[CITATION-96] The statement appeared more threatening because, later in 1986, Paisley and other DUP leaders accepted an invitation to lead the new paramilitary organisation Ulster Resistance.[CITATION-97] The DUP\u2019s position was meanwhile given a more secular slant by Peter Robinson, the party\u2019s deputy leader and the MP for East Belfast, who was an evangelical Christian but not a Free Presbyterian. Robinson argued that \u2018Unionists would have to consider independence for Northern Ireland if the Anglo-Irish Agreement remained the only terms on which they could stay in the United Kingdom\u2019.[CITATION-98] The barrister and politician Jim Allister, who had joined the DUP at its formation, had already made a case for an Ulster cultural identity shaped by \u2018its distinctly British and Protestant heritage\u2019 and now, fearing being \u2018swallowed up in a theocratic foreign state where our civil and religious liberties would be callously suppressed\u2019, publicly pondered \u2018a form of Dominion Status \u2026 maintaining the link with the Crown\u2019.[CITATION-99] Others besides the DUP considered independence. Driven to \u2018desolation\u2019 by the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Harold McCusker, the UUP MP for Upper Bann, deputy leader of the party and a prominent critic of Thatcher\u2019s economic and social policies, argued that Northern Ireland \u2018could survive as a separate entity\u2019\u2014although he swiftly retreated from this when his comments were disowned by the UUP leadership.[CITATION-100] Independence was mooted more consistently by the Ulster Clubs Movement, whose origins lay in opposition to the re-routing of Orange Order marches in the summer of 1985, which they believed had been done because of pressure from the Republic of Ireland amid Anglo-Irish talks.[CITATION-101] Now, in the late 1980s, Trimble, who had rejoined the UUP, articulated the Ulster Clubs Movement demands for \u2018Dominion Status\u2019 on the basis of the \u2018right to self-determination\u2019.[CITATION-102] However, in the years ahead, calls for independence became more marginal, with the only sustained advocacy coming from the Ulster Independence Committee, which had emerged from the Ulster Clubs.[CITATION-103] The most prominent advocate of integration was Enoch Powell, the British Conservative best known for his opposition to immigration. In October 1974, in an unusual move precipitated by his disagreement with the Conservative leader, Edward Heath, over membership of the European Community and the failure to move in a free-market direction, Powell became UUP MP for South Down. Powell had taken an active interest in Northern Ireland since 1968.[CITATION-104] Well before discussions of Ulster independence gathered pace, he had argued that Northern Ireland was part of the British nation defined by the geographical boundaries of the UK\u2014meaning that unionism, as he later put it, was \u2018the claim to be part of a whole \u2026 the British nation\u2019.[CITATION-105] For Powell, this took the form of an emphasis on institutions, especially Parliament, with the British nation characterised by allegiance to, and the undivided sovereignty of, the Crown-in-Parliament. Having announced his firm opposition to devolution in Scotland and Wales in 1968, two years later Powell argued that the Ulster Unionist \u2018assertion of oneness with the rest of the United Kingdom\u2019 was \u2018at odds with their assertion of this parliamentary independence\u2019\u2014that is, the commitment to Stormont.[CITATION-106] Given that the most prominent opposition to Stormont at this point came from republican circles, this was a provocative argument to make. Nevertheless, it was in one sense a return to the agenda of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century unionists, most notably the academic jurist A.V. Dicey, who opposed Irish Home Rule.[CITATION-107] Powell\u2019s argument also related directly to the Troubles, as he attributed to Stormont some responsibility for sustaining tensions by giving the impression that Northern Ireland was separate from the rest of the UK.[CITATION-108] Integration was more widely mooted after the suspension of Stormont in 1972: the UUP MPs at Westminster considered it at several of their meetings and Paisley came out briefly in its favour, telling the Prime Minister, Heath, in October 1972 that he \u2018saw the eventual solution in the total integration of Northern Ireland into the United Kingdom\u2019.[CITATION-109] On the whole, however, arguments for integration did not publicly gain ground. Indeed, even Powell\u2019s advocacy of it was muted, as he claimed during his first campaign in South Down to endorse the UUUC policy of majority-rule devolution within a future federal UK.[CITATION-110] Instead, Powell, who became close to James Molyneaux, the UUP leader at Westminster, focused on promoting two policies that were consistent with integration: increased parliamentary representation at Westminster in the absence of a local devolved parliament, and expanded local government\u2014whose functions had recently been restricted, partly so as to remove controversial areas, such as the allocation of public housing, from its control.[CITATION-111] Powell was successful in securing the principle of increased representation of Northern Ireland at Westminster in 1978.[CITATION-112] Over time, closer contacts were established between the UUP and the Conservative Party through the Conservative Northern Ireland Committee, set up after the suspension of Stormont and containing individuals amenable to integration, in which most notably Airey Neave but also Julian Amery and John Biggs-Davison played important roles.[CITATION-113] They coalesced in support for the establishment of regional councils with wide-ranging powers over local services, often presented pragmatically by the UUP as \u2018what can be achieved now\u2019.[CITATION-114] Yet after the Conservative return to power in 1979 and Neave\u2019s murder in that year by the Irish National Liberation Army, the military wing of the Irish Republican Socialist Party, the government abandoned the regional council scheme and, seeking devolution, tried to establish a conference involving the Northern Ireland political parties. With the UUP standing aside from the talks and theoretically still committed to regional councils, the party was now more visibly divided between those backing devolution and those supporting integration.In this context, Molyneaux, now overall UUP leader, sought to persuade the Conservative Northern Ireland Committee that \u2018the government should concentrate on improving direct rule\u2014but without using the term \u201cintegration\u201d to describe what it was doing\u2019.[CITATION-115] Yet he was more forthright in his identification with the British nation in the summer of 1982, amid the patriotism stimulated by the Thatcher government\u2019s victory over Argentina in the Falklands War. Weeks before Thatcher herself famously stated that \u2018We have ceased to be a nation in retreat\u2019, and with the final British assault under way, Molyneaux pre-empted her revivalist language to argue that:When the Task Force sailed for the South Atlantic the great mass of people discovered that they were a nation once again. This is the Britain which the old had forgotten and the young had never known. It is a nation which is only at the beginning of the adventure of discovery. It is a greatness in which Ulster shares, for greatness is indivisible.[CITATION-116] It was, however, Powell who did most to develop the case behind the call for integration at this juncture. Countering the suggestion that a power-sharing local assembly was needed to protect the interests of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland, Powell contended that \u2018Parliament \u2026 is the natural protector of all minorities because it is itself made up of minorities\u2019.[CITATION-117] This was, in an important sense, a rebuttal of the pervasive view\u2014used to buttress calls for devolution\u2014that party interests dominated Westminster in a negative way. Yet it also led Powell to confront the \u2018biggest and most significant difference \u2026 between the Province and the rest of the kingdom\u2019: the differing party structure that left Northern Ireland \u2018exiled from the political system that is the United Kingdom as a whole\u2019. Making it clear how this related to local political minorities, he argued: \u2018when, in the county of Durham, the Conservative minority contemplates the fact that it is unlikely to return a majority of Members to this House\u2014or vice versa in Hampshire\u2014it feels no estrangement as a result, because it identifies itself with the cause of the Labour Party, or the Conservative Party, as the case may be, throughout the nation\u2019.[CITATION-118] Even so, Powell did not publicly endorse electoral integration\u2014though he later privately acknowledged that in principle he supported it.[CITATION-119] It was not until the mid-1980s that there was a prominent call for British party political organisation in Northern Ireland, linked to a significant attempt to define the Union in terms of values. The UUP politician and barrister Robert McCartney had previously supported devolution, but after the Anglo-Irish Agreement came to endorse electoral integration. He argued that \u2018British citizens in Northern Ireland are denied the most basic political right of being able \u2026 to vote for a party which might, conceivably, form the government of the country of which they are alleged to be equal citizens.\u2019 Accepting that this could mean the end of the unionist parties, McCartney suggested that it could appeal to many Catholics who were \u2018not pro-Nationalist\u2019 but who had \u2018resented the sectarian and ascendency aspects of Unionism bred by devolution\u2019. Moreover, having previously described the UK as a \u2018pluralist state \u2026 a union between people who believe in liberal democracy\u2019, McCartney\u2019s argument was now underpinned by the view that the \u2018essence of the Union is the sharing of mutual cultural, historic, religious and political values between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom\u2019.[CITATION-120] Electoral integration gained the support of the UUP Young Unionists, who made an important contribution to the argument, pursuing an analysis adumbrated by the British and Irish Communist Organisation (BICO), which had supported British party political organisation in Northern Ireland since the late 1970s and had indeed recently begun to argue for it under the banner of \u2018Equal Citizenship\u2019.[CITATION-121] Alan Chalmers, the chair of the Greater Belfast Young Unionist Association, co-authored a pamphlet that reiterated the familiar contention that Ulster was \u2018governed as a colony\u2019. It went further, however, by taking the BICO line that it was because \u2018the national political parties had no involvement in Northern Ireland for so long and had no members or voters in the province [that] they had no sense of responsibility to the Ulster people\u2019. This, it argued, meant that when \u2018they assumed direct responsibility \u2026 it was inevitable, therefore, that they would behave as colonial overlords\u2019.[CITATION-122] Endorsing electoral integration as policy, the Young Unionist Council spelled out the argument that the British government had only been able to sign the Anglo-Irish Agreement, with Labour support, because \u2018they know they have no votes to gain or lose in Ulster\u2019.[CITATION-123] And in early July 1986, when McCartney spoke to a public meeting of the recently formed Campaign for Equal Citizenship, of which he later became president, he offered the same interpretation of the underlying cause of the current situation.[CITATION-124] Depth was added to the analysis by the pro-unionist University of Ulster politics academic Arthur Aughey who, supporting the equal citizenship campaign, explicitly defined unionism in terms of citizenship\u2014thus responding both to Irish Nationalism and to Powell\u2019s arguments about the British nation. Aughey argued that \u2018for unionists the question is not about nationality; it is about the state\u2019. He continued: \u2018Unionism is concerned primarily with the quality of citizenship within the Union; it is nationalists who are agitated by ideas of nationhood and its extent \u2026 There is no British nation; there are only British citizens\u2019.[CITATION-125] This was, moreover, part of a broader British debate, stretching across the twentieth century, about citizenship and whether it should be defined in terms of a \u2018patriotic attachment\u2019 to the British nation or in an attachment to the state.[CITATION-126] Yet, whatever its intellectual merits, electoral integration faltered on the ground. McCartney was unable to persuade his UUP colleagues to adopt a commitment to electoral integration at the party conference in late 1986, and a subsequent attempt to establish Conservative Associations in Northern Ireland floundered amid a lack of interest from Conservative Central Office and a failure to win unionist votes.[CITATION-127] In the early 1970s, the now little-known pressure group the New Ulster Movement (NUM) suggested ways to revise Stormont that were of long-term significance to the debate on power-sharing devolution. The NUM was formed in 1969, with the aim of developing moderate unionist policies and supporting the prime minister, Terence O\u2019Neill.[CITATION-128] Yet it soon took its arguments further. In 1970, with some of its leading figures about to leave to form the Alliance Party, the NUM stood firmly by the commitment to devolved government but with a \u2018duty \u2026 to seek and obtain the co-operation of nationalists\u2019.[CITATION-129] The following year, the NUM attached a critique of the Westminster model to its arguments. In a pamphlet written by John Whyte, a lecturer in political science at Queen\u2019s University, the NUM argued that the model worked well only if there were \u2018two strong parties, competing with each other on fairly equal terms\u2019\u2014as was currently the case with Conservative and Labour. In other circumstances, the NUM argued, it was \u2018a system which can easily lead to tyranny because it produces a remarkable concentration of power in the government of the day\u2019. The NUM now called for proportional representation (PR) at Stormont elections, with seats allocated to parties according to vote share. This was the basis on which Stormont had operated between 1921 and 1929, but the NUM suggested \u2018as a long-term possibility\u2014the introduction of proportional representation in government\u2019.[CITATION-130] The NUM\u2019s focus was on Northern Ireland, but in calling for PR it aligned itself with the British Liberal Party, which had been committed to electoral reform since the mid-1920s and had become more vocal from the mid-1960s as its share of the vote had increased without a corresponding rise in its number of MPs.[CITATION-131] Following Stormont\u2019s prorogation, the NUM moved even more explicitly towards the \u2018sharing of power \u2026 in proportion to party strength in the Assembly\u2019, with the use of a \u2018weighted majority \u2026 in controversial areas\u2019.[CITATION-132] Faulkner, as UUP leader and former Northern Ireland prime minister, also moved towards power sharing but did so with a degree of reluctance, privately recognising that it was \u2018necessary\u2019 but publicly stating that he was \u2018not opposed\u2019 to it.[CITATION-133] He was responding to the stance of the British government, which between autumn 1972 and spring 1973 had explicitly indicated its commitment to giving the minority a share of executive power. Yet, amid the rise of the UUUC, the UWC strike and the collapse of the Sunningdale Agreement, this path was politically rejected by most unionists. Thereafter, discussion of power sharing in a devolved Northern Ireland was eclipsed by discussion of it in an independent Ulster.It was not until the 1980s that power sharing in Northern Ireland began to be consistently advocated by unionists, with paramilitaries and their associated political bodies taking the lead and doing so in the context of resistance to Thatcherism. An important milestone came in 1981 when the UDA-linked NUPRG\u2014which had proposed Ulster independence in 1979\u2014became the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party (ULDP) and made clear that its proposals for government, \u2018supported by the substantial majority of both religious communities in Ulster\u2019, applied both to independence and to remaining in the UK. Echoing the NUM critique, the ULDP sought \u2018a system of parliament and government better suited to the Ulster people than a juggled version of the Westminster type\u2019.[CITATION-134] The overall change of position had resulted from a power struggle within the UDA that saw Glenn Barr leave and John McMichael, a UDA brigadier in South Belfast who was dismissive of Ulster independence, become ULDP chair.[CITATION-135] In 1986, the UDA\u2014now acting in its own name\u2014was emphatic in its support for equal citizenship, but argued that British party political organisation should occur within a devolved settlement that would also apply to Scotland and Wales, as well as to the regions of England. Describing itself as \u2018almost entirely working class\u2019, the UDA argued that regional inequalities and high levels of unemployment were the result of the government\u2019s \u2018gross mismanagement\u2019, which had destroyed \u2018our manufacturing base\u2019.[CITATION-136] The economic decline of manufacturing industry was part of a longer-term trend, but it had accelerated under the impact of both the Troubles and the Thatcher government, which, in celebrating the financial and services sectors, had embraced that structural shift. Strikingly, in Northern Ireland, the manufacturing sector had contracted by more than 50 per cent between 1971 and 1991.[CITATION-137] Mirroring the corporatist outlook that had enjoyed its apogee under the Labour governments of 1964 to 1970, the UDA sought a \u2018far sighted strategy for our industry and economy \u2026 one agreed to by the C.B.I. [Confederation of British Industry], the unions and Government\u2019 which would encourage the \u2018regeneration of the industrial sector\u2019. Crucially, the UDA sought PR across the UK in order to bring about \u2018a realignment of British politics and coalition governments\u2019.[CITATION-138] This point resonated in a British context where, at the last General Election in 1983, the Conservative share of the vote had fallen slightly from 1979 but\u2014with the opposition split between Labour and the Social Democratic Party (SDP)\u2013Liberal Alliance\u2014the party had increased its number of seats. The UDA position should also be placed against the stance of Sinn F\u00e9in, whose development McMichael had studied carefully.[CITATION-139] Under the leadership of Gerry Adams from late 1983, Sinn F\u00e9in had increasingly identified itself as a socialist party, speaking of the interests of the Irish working class and emphasising its commitment to substantial state intervention in the economy.[CITATION-140] The Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), linked to the UVF, also saw itself as a left-of-centre working-class group.[CITATION-141] Its origins lay in the Volunteer Political Party, which had been formed in 1974 and was opposed to independence.[CITATION-142] In 1979. the Progressive Unionist Group, soon to become Party, announced its commitment to devolution, including PR, and to the \u2018establishment of a voting partnership with all those who wish to pursue a common Programme of Social and Economic Advancement for the broad mass of the N. Ireland people\u2019.[CITATION-143] In the 1985 local government elections, held before the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the PUP campaigned to resist job losses caused by \u2018privatisation in the public sector\u2019 and to oppose \u2018the increasing attacks upon the British Welfare State\u2019.[CITATION-144] (From 1983, the privatisation of nationalised industries, including British Telecom and British Gas, was an increasingly important part of Thatcher\u2019s agenda.) In Northern Ireland, the PUP sought \u2018movement towards more general acceptability of sharing responsibility within a broadened structure of local government\u2019, embracing the \u2018principle of proportionality\u2019.[CITATION-145] After the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the PUP joined the call for British party political organisation, but, like the UDA, remained committed to devolution.[CITATION-146] The PUP also made its commitment to working with other left-wing parties clear. In early 1987, it presented a policy document to the British Labour Party\u2019s decision-making National Executive Committee that called for \u2018a sound regional planning policy to combat poverty [and] increase investment in regional industries\u2019. This document also proclaimed the PUP\u2019s dedication to the trade union movement, which\u2014viewed as an obstruction to the operation of the market\u2014had seen its powers restricted by legislation passed earlier in the decade by the Thatcher government.[CITATION-147] By this stage, in a document called, the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG), a new incarnation of the NUPRG chaired by McMichael, had announced its commitment to \u2018shared responsibility\u2019 and \u2018proportionality\u2019. There was little here that was technically new, but it did receive considerable attention\u2014including from John Hume, the SDLP leader. What was striking was that it framed its arguments with a degree of sophistication, arguing: \u2018Majority rule in deeply divided societies is likely to be profoundly undemocratic, and the only democratic system is one that allows participation in government by coalition of all groups, majority and minority, on a more or less permanent basis\u2019.[CITATION-148] The Republic of Ireland government reported speculation that the UPRG had \u2018brought in a \u201cprofessional hand\u201d to draft the final version\u2019, probably the politics academic Sidney Elliott from Queen\u2019s University, on whose work part of the report drew.[CITATION-149] Later in 1987, McMichael was murdered by the IRA, following a tip-off from within the UDA.[CITATION-150] Yet this did not affect the overall social and economic line taken. The following year, the ULDP mirrored the PUP in stating: \u2018If we wish to reverse the iniquities of Thatcherism we would need to join a common platform with other anti-Thatcher parties\u2019. It went on:We can not support the vision of society being constructed by Thatcher, a society where the nation\u2019s resources are squandered, where greed has become a religion, and where democracy continues to be eroded. Present Conservatism is not Unionism, it is a calculated appeal to those in the SE of England; the people of Scotland, Wales and the NE of England have become increasingly detached.[CITATION-151] In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a dramatic increase in loyalist sectarian killings, which led to the banning of the UDA. This level of violence sat uneasily with, and hindered the advancement of, the political arguments that the paramilitaries continued to make. A 1992 joint statement from the UDA and the UVF expressed their explicit commitment to \u2018proportionality\u2019 in the exercise of executive power.[CITATION-152] And their policy documents continued to be animated by a repudiation, as the PUP put it in 1995, of \u2018the values and ethos of the New Right\u2019, even after the fall of Thatcher.[CITATION-153] The other important advocate of power sharing in the 1990s, the UUP, adopted that position more slowly than the paramilitaries. The 1984 policy documentargued for devolving the \u2018administrative and functional powers\u2019 held by local government elsewhere in the UK. Administrative devolution, as it was called, was an attempt to forge a compromise between integrationist and devolutionist elements, but it was also presented as a means through which \u2018majority and minority representatives can participate without prejudice to their position on the constitutional question\u2019.[CITATION-154] This, in itself, might have appeared to be a limited commitment, but contacts between Frank Miller, the UUP General Secretary, and Republic of Ireland officials showed its significance. Worried about the rise of Sinn F\u00e9in, Miller argued that the \u2018tone of the document was \u2026 deliberately cast in a moderate and conciliatory fashion\u2019.[CITATION-155] In the event, the initiative came to nought. Miller renewed his efforts in 1987, as part of the Task Force set up by the UUP and DUP leaderships with a remit to consult a wide range of unionist opinion about alternatives to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Co-authored by McCusker from the UUP and Robinson from the DUP, the Task Force report called for \u2018Unionist flexibility\u2019, and suggested that weighted majorities should be used in the first period of any new devolved assembly.[CITATION-156] As Republic of Ireland officials noted, there was \u2018a case for seeing the Task Force report as a new departure in Unionist thinking\u2019, at least so far as the established parties were concerned.[CITATION-157] Yet the initiative was scuppered, with neither Paisley nor Molyneaux, as DUP and UUP leaders respectively, giving their approval, prompting Miller to leave the UUP and Robinson (temporarily) to resign as DUP deputy leader.Nevertheless, from the late 1980s there was an increased desire in the UUP to present the \u2018virtues and merits of the Union\u2019 to audiences outside Northern Ireland. This was in part a response to the shock of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the sense that unionists had been betrayed by their exclusion from the discussion process.[CITATION-158] It also occurred amid a realisation, among parts of Ulster Unionist opinion, that compromise might bring an end to the Troubles. This in turn sprang from an appreciation that the republican leadership considered that military victory was not likely.[CITATION-159] Together, these factors facilitated the UUP\u2019s adoption, in 1994, of a commitment to proportionality: a local assembly where \u2018Executive power would be exercised \u2026 broadly in proportion to Party strengths\u2019. Notably, the UUP made this case in a way that related to the end of the Cold War. Citing pledges made in the 1990 Charter of Paris, agreed at a summit that was effectively the peace conference of the Cold War, to protect the \u2018ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of national minorities\u2019, the UUP suggested that this could be a model for co-operation in Northern Ireland. Seeking the removal of the Republic of Ireland\u2019s territorial claim on Northern Ireland from its constitution, the UUP argued that the international precedent provided an example of the \u2018recognition of existing frontiers, abandonment of territorial ambition and mutual co-operation\u2019.[CITATION-160] The process gathered pace when Trimble, who had been an increasingly prominent MP since 1990, became UUP leader in 1995. Taking inspiration from Karl Popper\u2019s(1957), Trimble was determined to resist the teleological strain in Irish Nationalism that saw events leading inexorably towards Irish unity.[CITATION-161] Trimble was critical of moves towards further European integration as envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty, but welcomed the commitments to religious and cultural minorities within existing borders as part of the \u2018development of post-nationalist Europe\u2019.[CITATION-162] This was also an important attempt to strike a conciliatory note, as the pro-European John Hume had argued from the early 1990s that in a post-nationalist Europe existing identities could coexist with other allegiances and offer a means of resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland.[CITATION-163] Trimble\u2019s arguments reverberated amid talk of a \u2018New Unionism\u2019, which shared common ground with the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in suggesting that the union was based on values and that unionism was defined in terms of citizenship.[CITATION-164] Yet there were important differences in how the case was made. As Arthur Aughey (who had supported electoral integration in the 1980s) put it, \u2018New Unionism\u2019 was concerned with making \u2018a positive case for the Union as a multi-national state\u2019, offering \u2018multi-cultural citizenship\u2019.[CITATION-165] This related to concerns in a wider UK setting in which a distinctly English nationalism was emerging, arguably in response to European integration, and a \u2018separatist\u2019 Scottish nationalism had recently grown in strength and coherence under the impact of Thatcher.[CITATION-166] New Unionism further reflected a context where a commitment to \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 was not simply prevalent on the Left but took Conservative forms\u2014appearing to fit the reality of British, and especially English, society, which, shaped by immigration, was partly characterised by the diversity of its ethnic minority groups.[CITATION-167] Trimble also argued that the UK was a multi-national state. With an eye to his earlier emphasis on the community of the British Isles, he had asserted in 1992 that \u2018Being in one state is natural to the nations of the British Isles, for their destinies have been inextricably intertwined throughout recorded history\u2019.[CITATION-168] What was significant from the middle of the 1990s, however, was that Trimble considered that his view chimed with the pro-devolution agenda of Tony Blair, recently elected as Labour Party leader.[CITATION-169] This, in turn, reflected the \u2018new orthodoxy\u2019 that, in constitutional terms, the UK was a union state, characterised by imperfect integration and with its origins in the two unions with Scotland and Ireland, rather than being the product of the extension of the sovereignty of the English Parliament.[CITATION-170] Trimble told the UUP annual conference in October 1996 that, with Blair\u2019s New Labour in the ascendancy, \u2018unionism is winning the intellectual argument\u2019, adding: \u2018It is only unionism that can genuinely be multinational and multicultural. It believes that the sum of the whole is greater than that of the parts. This is a better vision that anything sectarian Irish nationalism can offer\u2019.[CITATION-171] This view was repeated in the UUP manifesto for the May 1997 General Election.[CITATION-172] At the same time, Trimble continued to stress the commitment to \u2018proportionality\u2019 in the government of Northern Ireland\u2014doing so, for example, to a US audience the month after the Labour victory.[CITATION-173] With executive power sharing, together with a form of PR, the single transferable vote, embedded in the Good Friday Agreement signed in April 1998 and approved in referenda across Ireland the following month, albeit with significant opposition from the DUP, Trimble now argued that unionism, defined by its values, especially diversity, was \u2018based on a sense of Britishness\u2019.[CITATION-174] Trimble did not expand on the concept of Britishness, but his argument coincided with wider usage of the term. Strikingly, at this very juncture, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, emphasised Britishness as a progressive force in the new devolved UK, with a Scottish Parliament and Welsh National Assembly soon to be established, and as a means of confronting the Scottish Nationalists.[CITATION-175] Amid fierce debate on the future of Northern Ireland, time and again the concerns of Ulster Unionists reflected the wider dilemmas faced by the UK state during a period of considerable change. Unsettled by the loss of Stormont, Ulster Unionists disagreed with each other as much as they challenged nationalists. By the early 1990s, the debate was increasingly dominated by competing calls for devolution\u2014majority-rule from the DUP and power-sharing from the UUP\u2014but at times during the 1970s and 1980s, both integration and independence had appeared as serious options.In the first place, Ulster Unionists engaged with arguments about the constitutional and national make-up of the UK. Until 1972, the existence of Stormont sat at odds with the widely held opinion that the UK was a centralised unitary state, but thereafter the position of Northern Ireland was debated as part of a broader constitutional discussion. The basis of Powell\u2019s argument for integration, and against devolution, was that the British nation was defined by the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament but this view did not gain significant support in Northern Ireland. Instead, many Ulster Unionists argued in the 1970s for the establishment of a federal UK, a loose notion that served the political purpose of enabling them to push for the restoration of majority rule, emboldened by the fact that the Royal Commission on the Constitution had advocated this as the basis of devolution for Scotland and Wales. By the 1990s, the UUP was arguing that the UK was a multi-national state, which was in line with both an understanding of the UK as a union state and New Labour\u2019s commitment to devolution. Even advocates of Ulster independence struggled to argue that there was an Ulster nation, but it is important to remember that Scottish Nationalism did not develop fully until the 1980s and English nationalism only advanced in the 1990s. In the mid-1980s, supporters of electoral integration had made a case that the Union should be defined in terms of its values of plurality and diversity\u2014an argument that was developed further by New Unionists supporting power sharing and embracing multi-culturalism in the 1990s. But, as commentators have increasingly noted, in Northern Ireland, as elsewhere in the UK, there was an inherent difficulty in pinning down precisely what these values were, even if Britishness was an attractive label to give them.[CITATION-176] Ulster Unionist thinking further echoed concerns about relationships within the UK. Considering that neither the Conservatives nor Labour were interested in protecting Northern Ireland\u2019s position within the UK, from the mid-1970s Ulster Unionists expressed a deep scepticism about Westminster political parties and individual politicians that, in a less virulent form, was coming to feature in British attitudes towards the political system as a whole. At the same time, some Ulster Unionists exhibited a particular unease at some of the societal changes associated with permissiveness. From its evangelical Protestant perspective, the DUP was the foremost voice here, but its position bore some resemblance to views within the Conservative Party. Unionism had long straddled well-established left and right divides on economic and social policy\u2014and this continued in the late twentieth century in a debate that focused increasingly on responses to Thatcherism. In the mid-1970s, advocates of independence embraced Thatcherite economic policies, including cuts to direct taxation and an attack on the dependency culture. Yet by the 1980s, it was opposition to Thatcher that was most apparent. The DUP criticised Thatcher\u2019s management of the economy and position on the welfare state, while the paramilitaries, calling for power sharing, launched a full-scale assault on Thatcherism amid the impact of deindustrialisation. They emphasised their class-based opposition, called for state planning and sought to work with others on the Left, giving renewed life to calls for PR to reform the electoral system.Ulster Unionist debates also mirrored the UK\u2019s awkward relationship with the wider world. With the Empire having earlier played a part in Ulster Unionist identity, Craig\u2019s critique of Britain\u2019s international decline mirrored that of the Conservative Monday Club, which sought to resist decolonisation. Nevertheless, overall, it was the Ulster Unionist adoption of the argument that under Direct Rule Northern Ireland was being treated undemocratically and like a colony that was most notable. Suggesting that the experience of being a colony was an undesirable one for the people concerned, this example serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle of the UK as a whole to grapple with its imperial legacy. So far as the European Community was concerned, criticism of membership from an economic perspective underpinned the arguments of one of the most forceful advocates of independence, Kennedy Lindsay, in the 1970s. What became more prominent over time, however, was the argument, advanced by the DUP, that membership threatened British parliamentary sovereignty. This position, connected by the DUP with calls for majority-rule devolution, assumed great importance in the 1990s among elements of the Conservative Party and UKIP\u2014and in recent years, with the DUP established as the largest unionist party and sharing power with Sinn F\u00e9in, it has been right at the forefront of debates over Brexit."

    "title": "The Paris Peace Conference and Cultural Reparations after the First World War*",
    "author": "Tom\u00e1s Irish",
    "date": "23 March 2023",
    "text": "The First World War was marked by cultural destruction that violated international law and outraged international audiences. This article examines the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and the five post-war treaties (Versailles, Saint-Germain, Neuilly, Trianon and S\u00e8vres) to explore how these issues were resolved in the post-war settlements. Rather than focusing solely on the substance of the treaties, the article examines the process through which they were negotiated, paying particular attention to the crucial role played by lobbyists such as museum directors, writers and politicians. It sets these negotiations in the wider context of the contemporary discourse about cultural destruction.The article asserts that the cultural provisions of the post-war treaties sit at the intersection of two key issues in post-war peacemaking: self-determination and reparations. Many states presented claims for the return of cultural objects or compensation for cultural destruction as essential to their national restoration after the war. Cultural claims generally appeared in the treaties\u2019 reparation clauses and their enactment was inherited by the post-war Inter-Allied Reparation Commission.The article argues that the post-war treaties demonstrate the dominance of the cultural claims of Western allies over those of eastern Europe and colonial settings. They also demonstrate a tension between a belief in universal civilisation and the claims of nation states to ownership of cultural property, which was most apparent in cases involving the dissolution of the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. Fundamentally, the decisions reached were often arbitrary rather than being guided by consistent principles or norms.In his 1923 account of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s role in the post-First World War settlements, Ray Stannard Baker wrote of the huge quantity of \u2018passionate and hopeful\u2019 appeals that reached the American president from around the world prior to the Paris Peace Conference.[CITATION-1] Baker, who had served as Wilson\u2019s press secretary, described these appeals collectively as \u2018the heart of the world laid bare\u2019, with petitioners seeking approval for their claims for \u2018islands and mines and harbours and secure boundaries and Rubens pictures and antique coins!\u2019[CITATION-2] Each of the five treaties signed at the end of the war\u2014Versailles, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Trianon and S\u00e8vres\u2014included articles which dealt explicitly with cultural matters. These covered issues such as the restitution of items that nations claimed had been looted from them either during the war or in the conflicts that preceded it and reparation for acts of cultural destruction that took place during the war. Most of these provisions were the result of a messy interplay between claims made by national delegations, lobbying by external actors and deliberation by representatives of the victorious Allies. They were generally discussed and formalised under the wider rubric of reparations.[CITATION-3] Much has been written about the diplomacy of the Paris Peace Conference and the five treaties that resulted from it.[CITATION-4] Within this literature, the cultural articles included in the treaties have received some attention, primarily from legal historians who emphasise the importance of the peace treaties in the development of international law and international norms. Wayne Sandholtz has argued that the First World War led to an \u2018important turn through the cycle of norm change\u2019 with respect to cultural destruction and pillage.[CITATION-5] Ana Filipa Vrdoljak has posited that the treaties \u2018laid down foundational principles for contemporary international cultural heritage law\u2019.[CITATION-6] Andrzej Jakubowski\u2019s work emphasises the role of the post-war settlements in establishing the idea of \u2018state succession to tangible cultural heritage in cases of cession and dissolution of the multinational state\u2019.[CITATION-7] These valuable works take elements of the settlements and trace their wider importance to subsequent legal developments, such as the protection of cultural property.[CITATION-8] Most of the legal scholarship in this area focuses on the substance of the treaties rather than the process informing their production.[CITATION-9] However, the ways in which treaties were discussed, drafted and effected are important because they shed light on three issues which are the focus of this article: self-determination, reparations, and the wider workings of the conference itself.Woodrow Wilson\u2019s promise of self-determination, an idea that resonated globally and suggested that populations could assert a right to nationhood, was central to many discussions at Paris. In practice, self-determination remained a vague idea which was applied in a limited and inconsistent manner and only in Europe.[CITATION-10] The vagueness of self-determination meant that arguments for and decisions regarding the precise borders of new or expanded states were made for a wide variety of (sometimes contradictory) reasons, including geographical characteristics, linguistic make-up, economics, and ethnicity, as well as political expediency.[CITATION-11] Leonard V. Smith has shown how petitioners to the peace conference frequently emphasised history as \u2018the decisive discourse\u2019, with former imperial rulers taking on the role of oppressors in these narratives.[CITATION-12] Calls for the restitution of cultural objects\u2014which far outnumbered those which actually appeared in the final treaties\u2014were based on tangible evidence of historic cultural development and membership of the \u2018civilised world\u2019, and became part of the diplomatic vocabulary utilised by states to underpin their claims to statehood or its expansion. As will be shown, claims to cultural objects in the name of nation states presented most problems where they affected so-called \u2018centres of civilisation\u2019 in deposed empires whose museums and galleries contained collections drawn from around Europe and the wider world. British and American diplomats often empathised with the plight of these museums and their collections.Secondly, calls for the restitution of cultural objects contribute to our understanding of reparations at the Paris Peace Conference. Reparations have attracted much scholarly attention, but most works on the topic focus on economics, such as the amount of reparation payments charged to Germany and its ability to meet these requirements in the 1920s.[CITATION-13] It was at the Commission on the Reparation of Damage that restitution of cultural objects was discussed, and it was through the institution of the post-war Inter-Allied Reparation Commission that the return of items was effected. Cultural objects took on a special value, providing moral compensation for what were perceived to be some of the worst excesses of total warfare, namely, the destruction of cultural sites such as Louvain University library in Belgium.[CITATION-14] The cultural damage perpetrated in wartime was a key component in how the war, its issues, and the image of both the Allied cause and that of the enemy other were conceptualised.[CITATION-15] Wartime cultural loss added stridency to the claims of certain states, such as Belgium, France and Italy, which were, in certain cases, compensated for by reparation through named cultural objects. Cultural reparations also demonstrate how wartime narratives emphasised cultural destruction in Western Europe\u2014especially by Germany in Belgium\u2014rather than its equivalent in Eastern Europe or beyond, and that this Western-centrism in turn shaped treaty articles.Finally, the article sheds light on the operation of the conference by analysing the role played by lobbyists. The issue of cultural reparations was complex and often beyond the expertise of national delegations. External experts were often sought out for their knowledge of technical issues, or volunteered, and sometimes they used this access as a means of lobbying for a particular outcome. Among the lobbyists who sought to influence the treaties were museum professionals who were opposed to the breaking-up of the \u2018great collections\u2019 of museums in Central Europe in order to compensate wartime foes. In a similar manner, archaeologists in Allied countries, fearful that access to antique sites might be lost following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, organised to lobby the conference to ensure that these sites were \u2018internationalised\u2019. Lobbying at the peace conference was effective where those concerned had both expertise to offer and access to those in power.[CITATION-16] The peace conference did not treat cultural claims equally. This article shows that there was a pattern whereby the claims of western Allies tended to be prioritised, with those further east less likely to have claims included in peace treaties. The article examines the provision of the treaties in the same order in which the peacemakers did, starting in Western Europe with the peace settlement with Germany, then gradually moving to Central Europe (Austria), then to East Central and Eastern Europe (Bulgaria and Hungary), and concluding with the settlement with the Ottoman Empire. This west-to-east logic not only suggests that cultural damage done in western theatres was considered more worthy of restitution, but it also demonstrates that delegates to the conference privileged the cultural achievements of Western and Central Europe. The article first discusses cultural destruction in wartime and the emergence of calls for restitution and reparation; it then assesses the structures of the peace conference, before addressing themes in the settlements. It concludes by discussing how the Inter-Allied Reparation Commission resolved some of these issues in the early 1920s. The Paris Peace Conference showed that culture was an important element in how the post-war order was conceptualised and the ways in which states and cultural institutions made arguments in favour of their preferred vision of a settlement. The resulting treaty articles\u2014the product of work by politicians and diplomats, as well as well-positioned intellectuals, museum professionals, and other lobbyists\u2014reveal much about the power of culture in the conduct of international diplomacy, an issue that is as pressing today as it was in 1919.Pillage and the targeting of cultural sites have been a part of warfare for centuries. Ancient and medieval wars were fought with no special sanctity afforded to cultural sites and it was not until the eighteenth century that spoliation of museums and libraries was condemned. The looting of cultural property in war reached its high point during the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars but became increasingly controversial thereafter; the restitution of cultural objects by France after the Napoleonic wars has frequently been cited as a key turning point in the changing of attitudes towards plunder in wartime.[CITATION-17] By the start of the twentieth century, the emergence of international law had begun to provide greater (theoretical) legal protection for cultural sites in wartime, but that did not always change behaviour.[CITATION-18] Article 27 of the 1907 Hague Convention stated that in sieges and bombardments, \u2018all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, [and] historic monuments \u2026 provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes\u2019.[CITATION-19] Crucially, colonised territories and populations\u2014themselves frequently targets of cultural destruction\u2014were afforded none of the protections that were emerging in the form of international law.[CITATION-20] International protection of cultural sites was dramatically violated during the First World War. Alan Kramer has argued that cultural destruction was intrinsic to the violence of that conflict.[CITATION-21] Across the European fronts, from the west to the east, historic, educational and religious sites were targeted in combat. The most infamous instances of cultural violence took place at the beginning of the war in Belgium and France. The destruction of Louvain library in August 1914 and the shelling of Reims Cathedral by the German army in late September became points of reference for German \u2018barbarism\u2019.[CITATION-22] The violence on the Western Front in 1914 provoked an international outcry and initiated a discourse that viewed cultural destruction against the standard of international law as embodied in the Hague Convention.[CITATION-23] These events were unique in their function as mobilising myths at the beginning of the conflict, but cultural destruction itself was not confined to Western Europe.The Austrian bombardment of Belgrade at the start of the conflict caused significant damage to the University of Belgrade and the Serbian national museum.[CITATION-24] During its occupation of Serbia, which began in 1915, the Bulgarian army pursued a policy of \u2018denationalisation\u2019 in eastern Serbia, which sought to eradicate Serbian cultural influence through the destruction of books, manuscripts and archives.[CITATION-25] This cultural violence mirrored that which had been seen during the Balkan Wars of 1912\u201313.[CITATION-26] In the east, the occupying German army claimed that the retreating Russian forces were responsible for the destruction and looting of cultural objects such as statues, church bells and archives.[CITATION-27] On the Italian front, the Austrian and German forces conducted bombing raids between 1915 and 1918 which caused significant damage to churches, museums, libraries and archives in towns and cities in northern Italy.[CITATION-28] Following the bombing of Venice in 1918, one French newspaper remarked that \u2018nothing is sacred to the Germans\u2019, likening this bombardment to that of Reims Cathedral in 1914.[CITATION-29] In 1918, the German guns shelled Paris, leading to the destruction of the nave of the thirteenth-century church of St Gervais.[CITATION-30] Both the British Museum in London and the Bodleian Library in Oxford began making preparations for an aerial bombardment in 1915.[CITATION-31] After the international outcry that followed the burning of Louvain and the bombardment of Reims, the German army took special care to protect cultural sites in occupied Belgium and later in the territories under its occupation in the east.[CITATION-32] In 1919, the German art historian Paul Clemen published an edited volume calledwhich not only described German efforts to protect cultural sites during the war, but also detailed many instances of French and British destruction of churches through artillery fire near the front lines.[CITATION-33] Germany also published a book detailing its protection of monuments in the Ottoman Empire, which was disseminated to neutral nations by the German foreign ministry.[CITATION-34] Germany\u2019s claim to be a protector of cultural sites was an important part of its international propaganda by the end of the war. Against this, representatives of French museums alleged that Germany had looted artworks from collections in northern France under the guise of protecting them from the fighting, while many publications described the destruction of churches, monuments and other cultural sites by the German army.[CITATION-35] Cultural destruction was an emotive topic in wartime, which, for some, led to the question of post-war reparation. The American journalist John Reed reported that there were calls in 1915 for post-war treaties to contain articles requiring that Serbia receive reparations in the form of books and laboratories for the damage done to the University of Belgrade.[CITATION-36] In 1917, the Oxford historian C.H. Firth argued that the precedent of restitution of manuscripts and archives after the Napoleonic wars should be followed at the post-war peace settlements.[CITATION-37] The American museum curator Alfred Mansfield Brooks argued in 1918 that Germany ought to replace in kind what had been taken or destroyed from French and Belgian collections.[CITATION-38] In 1919, Henry Guppy, the librarian of the John Rylands Library in Manchester, wrote that Germany should \u2018be compelled to provide an equivalent, either in money or in kind, from their own well-stocked galleries, museums, and libraries\u2019 for cultural objects and sites destroyed in the war.[CITATION-39] The cultural destruction of the First World War was significant because of how it shocked and mobilised educated audiences across the world, meaning that the issue of cultural reparations\u2014either as compensation for wartime damage or as a corollary to post-war territorial changes\u2014became an issue with which the peace conference would have to deal.[CITATION-40] Wartime damage accentuated a sense of grievance for states such as Belgium, France and Italy and consolidated a determination to claim reparation. The primacy of western cultural loss in wartime discourses also played a key role in shaping how treaty negotiations played out and who did\u2014and did not\u2014receive satisfaction for their claims.The Paris Peace Conference sat from January 1919. The question of cultural issues was not dealt with by a bespoke, expert committee but was discussed in many places, both formally and informally. The conference was a gathering of victor states, dominated by the Council of Four (the United States, Britain, France and Italy), who negotiated a settlement among themselves before presenting it to each of the vanquished states (Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary and the Ottoman Empire) to sign. In total, five treaties were signed: the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on 28 June 1919; the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye with Austria on 10 September 1919; the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine with Bulgaria on 27 November 1919; the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary on 4 June 1920; and the Treaty of S\u00e8vres with the Ottoman Empire on 10 August 1920.Cultural objects and their restitution or replacement formed a frequent and contentious topic of discussion at the Paris Peace Conference, but the term \u2018cultural property\u2019 was not defined until the 1954 Hague Convention.[CITATION-41] While the modern lexicon of cultural property was not available to the delegates in 1919, many of them shared a sense that cultural sites and objects ought to be categorised separately in claim-making, as well as feeling that damage to cultural sites during the war required compensation. This was heightened by the wide range of claims submitted to them by various national delegations and institutions. According to John Foster Dulles, a lawyer in the American delegation, ambiguous language was frequently used in order to enable compromise between \u2018two conflicting interpretations\u2019.[CITATION-42] Discussions of cultural matters at the peace conference took place in commissions set up primarily to discuss other issues: namely, the Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties (CRAWEP), established to ascertain culpability for the war and breaches of law in it, and the Commission on the Reparation of Damage (CRD).[CITATION-43] The articles in the post-war treaties dealing with cultural issues were all included in the sections dealing with reparations, meaning that they were discussed and drafted by economists, bankers and lawyers who were concerned with the larger issue of the ability of defeated states to pay for wartime damage, the categories of damage to be included among reparations, and the proportion of reparations to be allocated to each of the victor states, among other things.[CITATION-44] The different delegations represented on the CRD had divergent national and personal views of these issues, as well as of the procedures to be adopted in addressing them.[CITATION-45] Many articles found their way into the treaties via personal contacts that circumvented the CRD outright.The language used to frame the discussion of cultural destruction and reparation was generally informed by the experience of a given state during the conflict. This was exemplified by submissions made to CRAWEP, which was set up in January 1919.[CITATION-46] National delegations submitted detailed documents that outlined wartime violations of international law on their territory. The French and Italian claims both cited the German violation of Article 56 of the Hague Convention, which prohibited the seizure or destruction of religious, educational or scientific institutions or monuments, artworks, and scientific material.[CITATION-47] The Serbian submission made reference to Bulgarian \u2018denationalisation\u2019 policies in Macedonia, such as the destruction of historic monuments and manuscripts and the suppression of Serbian-language education.[CITATION-48] Serbia argued that cultural and educational destruction on their territory had been both deliberate and integral to how Bulgaria had waged war. CRAWEP\u2019s report concluded that among the crimes to be prosecuted was \u2018wanton destruction of religious, charitable, educational, and historic buildings and monuments\u2019.[CITATION-49] It utilised the language of Article 27 of the 1907 Hague Convention and asserted that these breaches would be prosecuted as war crimes.[CITATION-50] While political disagreements meant that the Leipzig trials, which sat from 1921, fell short of the aspirations of many nations, CRAWEP demonstrated that cultural damage in wartime was a significant concern of states exiting the conflict.The CRD had to determine categories of damage and estimate how losses should be compensated. The commission\u2019s first sub-committee dealt with the issue of what war damage should be considered for reparations. In February 1919, national delegations submitted their claims. The French and British submissions both made reference to artworks in a general sense as a category of war damage. The Italian submission mentioned cultural damage in its first point and included \u2018artistic patrimony\u2019 as a category. The Serbian submission highlighted a separate section for \u2018scientific and artistic education\u2019 which specifically mentioned damage to libraries, museums, theatres and laboratories. The Czechoslovak document mentioned \u2018intellectual and moral damage\u2019, while the Belgian document had a separate category for \u2018science and art\u2019, which included universities, observatories, churches, monuments and artworks. The language of cultural damage and reparation reflected the manifold national experiences of the war and the relative value of cultural sites and practices within different nations.[CITATION-51] In a plenary session of the reparations commission on 6 March 1919, Lord Cunliffe, a former governor of the Bank of England and one of the British representatives on the CRD, noted the difficulty of assigning value to destroyed works of art in order to arrange reparation, suggesting that they could be replaced by items of equivalent value taken from collections in the offending country\u2014a proposal with which the French minister of finance and president of the commission, Louis-Lucien Klotz, agreed.[CITATION-52] However, the second sub-committee decided at a meeting on 23 April that the general principle of restitution in kind would not be admitted, but the idea of repatriation of works of art would.[CITATION-53] The CRD was generally seen as having expertise to deal with cultural issues, and specific matters were often referred to it from other parts of the conference.[CITATION-54] The discussions at both CRAWEP and the CRD illustrated that issues of cultural reparation and repatriation would cut across all of the post-war treaties and that they were understood differently by the victims of cultural damage as well as by those adjudicating the respective claims.Cultural claims were complicated because delegations were frequently lobbied by experts or external actors with vested interests, such as learned societies or representative associations. At the beginning of March 1919, the French Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts sent a petition to the French government which condemned the enemy\u2019s \u2018spirit of vandalism\u2019 in wartime and suggested that French artworks held in public museums in Germany and Austria be valued and returned to France as compensation.[CITATION-55] Late in March 1919, the library of the \u00c9cole des Chartes petitioned the French Prime Minister, Georges Clemenceau, suggesting that a specially appointed committee of French experts should be dispatched to survey the holdings of German libraries and select \u2018manuscripts and incunabula of interest to France\u2019 as compensation for objects that had been destroyed in the war.[CITATION-56] The British Museums Association petitioned the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, arguing that Germany should restore items taken from collections in invaded countries and, failing that, \u2018the Germans should be called upon to replace them by similar specimens of equivalent value\u2019.[CITATION-57] Lobbying of delegations continued during the discussion of specific articles, demonstrating that decisions were not reached in isolation but were the result of a complex set of interconnected, but not equally weighted, interests.Lobbying worked in two directions. Delegations were frequently petitioned by outside actors, but, as the official delegations were trying to resolve complex issues about which they were not always specialists, they also sought out expert advice elsewhere. Sir Frederic Kenyon, the president of the British Academy and director of the British Museum, was frequently solicited for advice by the British delegation. These connections were reciprocal: delegations could gain invaluable information from expert contacts, but the latter could also seek to exert influence on the content of treaties.The post-war treaties all made general provisions for the restitution of cultural items that were taken during the conflict, but few made explicit provision for reparations to address cultural damage in war. The Treaty of Versailles was exceptional in this respect as it made specific mention of cultural items to be restored to France, Belgium and the British Empire, each of which was seen as righting a historic wrong. In the Belgian case this related to the destruction of the library at Louvain in 1914, whereas for France restitution went back to the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. The cultural articles of the Treaty of Versailles demonstrated the primacy to be accorded to the specific cultural claims of the main Allied nations in Western Europe; the same standard was not equally applied in the treaties of Saint-Germain, Trianon or Neuilly. Versailles also underscored the central position that Germany occupied among vanquished states.Three articles dealing with cultural reparations were inserted into the Treaty of Versailles; 245, 246 and 247.[CITATION-58] Article 247 specifically called for reparation for the destruction of the university library of Louvain, a key point in international cultural mobilisation at the beginning of the war. Despite the centrality of Louvain to debates about cultural destruction, it was a late addition to the treaty and did not emanate from the CRD. The Belgian government tabled the proposal at the end of April 1919 directly to Clemenceau, with the drafting committee adding it to the treaty at the start of May 1919.[CITATION-59] In his letter to Clemenceau, the Belgian foreign minister Paul Hymans cited the Hague conventions and claimed that although the damage done to Louvain could not be compensated for in monetary terms, Germany ought to make an \u2018equitable compensation\u2019.[CITATION-60] Article 247 committed Germany to furnish \u2018the University of Louvain [with] manuscripts, incunabula, printed books, maps and objects of collection corresponding in number and value to those destroyed in the burning by Germany of the Library of Louvain\u2019. It also named two works of art to be returned to Belgium. These were the triptych of the Mystic Lamb by the Van Eyck brothers and the triptych of the Last Supper by Dieric Bouts, both of which had been acquired legitimately by German museums.[CITATION-61] This provision constituted a form of restitution in kind for damage to Belgian property in the war and in so doing went against the resolutions of the Reparation Commission against restitution in kind of only a few weeks prior.[CITATION-62] Lord Sumner, a judge and British representative on the CRD, wrote with some frustration that \u2018the Reparation Commission had nothing to do with the clauses in the German Treaty\u2019, by which he meant articles 246 and 247.[CITATION-63] While the CRD sought to apply some consistency of approach, decisions regarding specific articles were sometimes taken by the Council of Four for political reasons.The example of Article 247 was not widely repeated in the other treaties and this reflects the elevated status that Belgium held at the peace conference as the \u2018first victim\u2019 of Germany in 1914. Belgium had been singled out in Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points as deserving full \u2018restoration\u2019 and, at the peace conference, the Belgian delegation pressured the peacemakers to ensure that they received special treatment.[CITATION-64] The Serbian leader Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 highlighted this inequality of treatment in a letter to Clemenceau.[CITATION-65] Belgian treatment also suggests that cultural sites in Western Europe held an elevated status when compared with those in places such as Serbia, where details of widespread cultural damage were submitted to the conference\u2019s commissions but not integrated into reparation settlements.France also called for the restitution of cultural objects in the Treaty of Versailles. Article 245 required that Germany restore \u2018trophies, archives, historical souvenirs or works of art carried away from France\u2019 during the course of the Franco-Prussian war of 1870\u201371. This provision emanated from a proposal which was tabled in the French Chamber of Deputies on the day of the armistice, 11 November 1918.[CITATION-66] The trophies concerned were mostly flags, with the most cherished being those of General Bazaine, commander of the French Army of the Rhine, which had surrendered at Metz in October 1870.[CITATION-67] A few days before Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, fourteen of these flags were stolen from the arsenal in Berlin and destroyed by German officers and soldiers in front of a statue of Frederick the Great, which raised tensions in France.[CITATION-68] Speaking at the Chamber of Deputies, Clemenceau argued that the burning of these flags and the scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow meant that French people would need to remain \u2018on their guard\u2019 with respect to Germany.[CITATION-69] Article 245 also required Germany to restore to France the Cer\u00e7ay papers which were seized by Bismarck\u2019s forces during the Franco-Prussian war in 1870. The papers contained diplomatic correspondence between Napoleon III of France and various rulers of southern German states who were opposed to Prussian dominance of the unified Germany that later emerged.[CITATION-70] While limited material from them had been made public in 1871, they were otherwise inaccessible to historians in the almost half-century that followed and remained \u2018a little historical enigma\u2019.[CITATION-71] Among those credited with the inclusion of this item in the treaty was the politician, writer and Dreyfusard Joseph Reinach.[CITATION-72] The cultural claims in the Treaty of Versailles were the consequence of wartime cultural destruction or a general desire for national expiation after the conflict.[CITATION-73] The French claims related to items that resembled traditional spoils of war; the taking of flags was a common feature of warfare in the nineteenth century and the return of captured flags was highly symbolic in reinforcing a desire for national revenge following the defeat of 1870.[CITATION-74] The same was true of the Cer\u00e7ay papers. The restoration of the manuscript collections of Louvain addressed the most infamous instance of cultural destruction in the war and was uncontroversial, but its example was not widely replicated elsewhere; the issues provoked by the settlement in Central and Eastern Europe proved much more complex and rested, in many cases, upon competing visions of national identity and their compatibility with the logic of reparations.While the question of dealing with Germany exercised the Allied delegates most at the peace conference, the treaty with Austria had the most complicated and controversial cultural issues to resolve. The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy opened up questions of the ownership of cultural items which had either originated in the Habsburg Empire or had been acquired by the Habsburgs from the late eighteenth century onwards. Many of these items were on display in museums, meaning that the issues at stake centred on the question of states displaying cultural objects that had originated elsewhere. The possession of cultural objects and their display in national museums was a means through which states could articulate both their national identity and their civilisational progress. Early twentieth-century Vienna was seen as one of Europe\u2019s great cities where, in the words of the contemporary satirist Karl Kraus, the streets were \u2018paved with culture\u2019.[CITATION-75] The issues raised at the peace conference had the potential to form a precedent for the restitution of objects to their country of origin. In this way, they anticipated twenty-first-century debates about cultural restitution between metropoles and former extra-European colonies, but with the distinction that these debates were an intra-European affair.At a meeting of the second sub-commission of the CRD on 21 February 1919, the Italian representative Mariano d\u2019Amelio stated that the Italian government had compiled a list of artworks for which it would seek restitution from Austria. These included both works taken in the recently ended war and those which had not been restored since the Italian reclamation of Lombardy from the Habsburg Empire in 1859 and the Veneto in 1866. A number of Italian claims focused on items which had been removed from Venice to Vienna while under Habsburg rule.[CITATION-76] Rather than waiting for the conference to adjudicate the claim, the Italians acted peremptorily. On 12 and 13 February a team of Italian representatives, led by Gino Fogolari, went to galleries and museums across Vienna, identifying and taking over sixty works of Italian origin, in what one Austrian newspaper described as a \u2018rape\u2019 and another called \u2018the picture war\u2019 ().[CITATION-77] The Austrian foreign minister, Otto Bauer, immediately protested to the Italian Armistice Commission in Vienna, while the Austrian government protested to the Allied powers at the peace conference, citing Article 56 of the Hague Convention.[CITATION-78] The Austrian government claimed that the various items seized by Italy were the property of either the former monarchy, the court, or the old Austrian state, and that the armistice agreements gave Italy no rights to claim these items.[CITATION-79] In the middle of April 1919, the Italians made a new set of demands on Austria for the return of artworks. On 19 April, Dr Gl\u00fcck of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna estimated that the works being claimed by Italy were worth much more than any damage done to works of art by the Austrian army in the north of Italy during the war.[CITATION-80] Austrian museums sought to mobilise international opinion against the Italian claims, and an appeal reached the British delegation in June 1919. Addressing itself to \u2018British and American public opinion\u2019, it expressed its hope that they would \u2018refuse to leave the spiritual goods of nation at the mercy of the political market and to allow an elderly beauty like Vienna being, so to say, undressed before the eyes of the whole world\u2019. The document appealed to British and American self-interest and claimed that the logic applied by the Italians could lead to \u2018the dissolution of all the great collections in the world\u2019\u2014such as the British Museum, or the Metropolitan Museum.[CITATION-81] In August 1919, a second, shorter protest was communicated to the Foreign Office in the name of Austrian art, which again protested against the potential splitting up of its collections.[CITATION-82] The idea that Vienna and cities like it were \u2018centres of civilisation\u2019 and thus entitled to house collections from around the world was one which gained some sympathy. Harold Temperley, a historian and part of the British delegation, characterised Austrian protests as \u2018a last plea for the Old Vienna as a centre of culture and a gracious citadel of art\u2019.[CITATION-83] Woodrow Wilson wrote privately of a \u2018pathetic\u2019 appeal that he had received from Vienna, noting his opposition to the \u2018spoliation\u2019 of collections for the damage that it would do to their \u2018scientific value\u2019.[CITATION-84] Frederic Kenyon wrote to the British Foreign Office in late May 1919 to add his weight to the criticisms of Italian claims.[CITATION-85] The art scholar Sidney Colvin wrote to the British Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, arguing that the Italian claims were \u2018far beyond the limits of justice\u2019.[CITATION-86] The protests lodged against Italian claims in Austria all saw the nationalisation of cultural objects as problematic, because of both the difficulty of proving national ownership of cultural objects and the potential that, were this logic applied to all art collections, it could lead to museums across Europe and North America losing valuable objects in the future. Beyond these complex issues, British diplomats in Paris struggled to determine the truth of what was happening in Vienna. Harold Nicolson noted on 7 July that \u2018we cannot be perfectly certain that the information which has reached us is accurate. We are certain, however, that the Italians have taken a large number of works of art away from Vienna.\u2019[CITATION-87] The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye contained six articles (191\u20136) relating to cultural issues, all of which appeared as \u2018special provisions\u2019 in the section dealing with reparations. Articles 191 and 192 required that Austria return \u2018all records, documents, objects of antiquity and of art, and all scientific and bibliographical material\u2019 which had been taken from both invaded territories and ceded territories since 1 June 1914. Article 193 required that Austria relinquish \u2018all the records, documents and historical material possessed by public institutions which may have a direct bearing on the history of the ceded territories and which have been removed during the last ten years\u2019 (extended to 1861 in the case of Italy). Article 195 stated that, within a year of the treaty coming into effect, the Reparation Commission would appoint a committee of three jurists to examine the manner in which the House of Habsburg came into possession of \u2018objects or manuscripts in possession of Austria\u2019 and arrange their restitution to Italy if required.The drafters of the Treaty of Saint-Germain decided that the best approach was not to require the return of named items in the treaty, but to defer decisions until after the signing of the treaty and to encourage bilateral agreements between states. Lord Cunliffe had suggested this as early as 21 February 1919.[CITATION-88] In August 1919, Austria and Italy signed a series of agreements regarding reparation of cultural objects and archives: Austria committed to hand over to Italy unnamed works of art as a \u2018just concession to public opinion\u2019; Italy agreed that it would hand back three manuscripts \u2018taken as security\u2019 from the Hofbibliothek in Vienna.[CITATION-89] When the Treaty of Saint-Germain was signed the following month, it included an annex of specific items, organised into four areas of Italy (Naples, Palermo, Modena, and Tuscany), which were to be referred to the committee of three jurists.In May 1920, Italy and Austria signed another treaty in which Italy accepted that the \u2018dispersion of historic, artistic and archaeological collections of Austria\u2019 was not in the \u2018general interest of civilization\u2019. Consequently, the two states agreed to the restitution of a number of items mentioned in the annexes to Article 195 without referring to the expert committee of three jurists named in the treaty.[CITATION-90] In September 1920 Austria and Italy reached a further agreement whereby Italy would receive \u2018all the works of art and manuscripts which were brought to Vienna after 1790 from the provinces abandoned by Austria\u2019, with Austria giving up any claim to items already taken by Italy. In return, Italy agreed to support Austria against any similar claims made by other nations.[CITATION-91] The agreements between Italy and Austria simultaneously addressed the national claims of Italy while underscoring the importance of the idea of keeping collections together for the benefit of civilisation.The debates about the cultural articles of the Treaty of Saint-Germain demonstrated the difficulty of repatriating cultural objects following the collapse of the Habsburg Empire. The contentious issues were mostly unconnected to the war, relating rather to historic claims to ownership of artworks and other objects, and involved museum professionals, learned societies, and diplomats alike. Italy, as one of the major Allies and members of the Council of Four, and a country associated with high culture, was largely successful in its aims of ensuring the return of a number of pieces to which it had claims dating back to the eighteenth century. The debates about Italian actions highlighted a tension between the claims of a nation to ownership of cultural objects and the idea of a universal European civilisation which was on display in the museums of Vienna, London and Paris.The end of the Habsburg Empire saw inconsistent attempts to apply self-determination to territories in Central and Eastern Europe along geographical, linguistic and historic lines. Many national delegations submitted lists of items which they wanted restored to them as part of a peace settlement, demonstrating that culture sat alongside territorial negotiations in the process of post-war state-building. A wide range of claims for the return of cultural objects was proposed as the treaties of Saint-Germain, Trianon and Neuilly were being drafted. Many of these proposals took articles 245\u20137 of the Treaty of Versailles as their template, but they were not ultimately adopted. Instead, the treaties spoke in terms of general principles rather than specific instances of restitution, with the drafters keen to leave decisions regarding particular acts of restitution to bilateral agreements or to avoid them outright.Both the treaties of Saint-Germain (Article 196) and Trianon (Article 177) contained articles which required Austria and Hungary to negotiate with new or reconstituted states for whom objects or documents of \u2018artistic, archaeological, scientific or historic character\u2019 which were part of collections that had formerly belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire formed part of their \u2018intellectual patrimony\u2019.[CITATION-92] These articles also called for these (unspecified) collections not to be alienated for a period of twenty years and to be made available \u2018to students who are nationals of any of the Allied and Associated Powers\u2019. This provision was drafted by Lord Sumner in response to a claim made by the Yugoslav delegation in May 1919.[CITATION-93] They requested that Austria send to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes a share of the collections of state universities, academies and scientific institutions in Austria in proportion with the number of inhabitants who, by treaty, were incorporated into the new Yugoslav state from the former Habsburg Empire, as well as cultural objects that had been removed from these territories in the past.[CITATION-94] Their negotiating position was complicated by the fact that Serbia had been invited to the conference even as the Allies had yet to formally recognise the existence of this new, South Slav state.[CITATION-95] The Yugoslav proposal suggested that new or enlarged states required intellectual capital to safeguard their vitality.The Yugoslav delegation was not the only one to present requests for the return of specific items in the name of their nation. Article 195 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain also allowed for Belgium, Poland and Czechoslovakia to submit claims for restitution to the commission of three jurists, effectively deferring a decision on the final restitution of certain items until after the conference. Each of these cases was the result of a formal petition submitted to the conference by the delegation of the states in question. For example, at the end of May 1919, the Polish delegation submitted a list of items to be restored to Poland, most of which dated to the late eighteenth century. The drafters rejected this proposal and instead required that Poland\u2019s claim to the Gold Cup of King Ladislaus IV, then held by the Court Museum of Vienna, be referred to the committee of jurists, possibly motivated by Italian threats to submit further claims if Poland\u2019s were admitted.[CITATION-96] The settlements in Eastern Europe\u2014the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary and the Treaty of Neuilly with Bulgaria\u2014were notable for the lack of detail given to cultural items in their terms and the non-inclusion of claims by states to the return of specific objects, in contrast to the treaties of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Versailles, which either enumerated specific items to be restored or referred the question to the committee of jurists. This could be seen as surprising because many accusations of cultural vandalism had been made by Romania, Serbia and Greece against Bulgaria. In June 1919, the Greek government submitted a proposal for Bulgarian reparations which listed a range of \u2018war trophies, antiquities, books, documents, manuscripts, paintings, artworks, religious relics and historic items\u2019 to be returned to Greece, Yugoslavia and Romania, all dating from the start of the Balkan Wars in 1912. The Greek government also submitted a claim for the return to Greece of manuscripts, religious items and other artworks taken by the Bulgarian army from eastern Macedonia since 1913, as well as requesting that Yugoslavia receive named items, such as the relics of Stefan Milutin, the medieval king of Serbia, at that point held in a cathedral in Sofia.[CITATION-97] The drafters of the Treaty of Neuilly were guided by the wider logic of reparations. Lord Sumner argued that \u2018to apply to Bulgaria the same type of clauses as the German Treaty contains presents some difficulties\u2019 and so he suggested that a fixed sum for reparations should be included in the treaty.[CITATION-98] Those in favour of a fixed sum intended that this would compensate for all losses, thus overriding the need for specific items to be enumerated as had been the case in the Treaty of Versailles. The Allies were split on this issue, but ultimately the Anglo-American desire for a fixed sum prevailed.[CITATION-99] The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, signed with Bulgaria on 27 November 1919, did not include specific details of items to be returned. It acknowledged that \u2018the resources of Bulgaria are not sufficient to enable her to make complete reparation\u2019 and, unlike the Treaty of Versailles, included a fixed sum (2,250,000,000 gold francs) to be repaid (Article 121). There was no itemised enumeration of cultural objects in the treaty; instead, a general article (126) required the Bulgarian government to return \u2018any records or archives or any articles of archaeological, historic or artistic interest\u2019 which were taken from Greece, Romania or Yugoslavia during the war. Any dispute about ownership of articles was to be referred to an arbitrator to be appointed by the Inter-Allied Reparation Commission.[CITATION-100] The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye was an important model for the Treaty of Trianon, signed with Hungary on 4 June 1920.[CITATION-101] Article 175 of Trianon required that Hungary surrender \u2018records, documents, objects of antiquity and of art, and all scientific and bibliographical material taken away from the invaded territories\u2019. Article 176 required that it return objects taken from the ceded territories, while Article 177 followed the model of Article 196 of the Austrian treaty in facilitating the bilateral return of objects.[CITATION-102] Trianon was similar to both Versailles and Saint-Germain in that it did not establish a fixed sum for Hungary to pay and instead left this to be determined by the post-war Reparation Commission (Article 163).The Treaty of Trianon reduced the territory of Hungary by two-thirds and took away intellectual capital that Hungarians felt rightfully belonged to them. This was the opposite of the problem faced by the Yugoslav state. Hungarian advocates of treaty revision claimed that Trianon had resulted in Hungary losing two universities, four colleges of jurisprudence, two colleges of agriculture and 745 public and scientific libraries (amounting to 4 million volumes of a pre-war total of 9.5 million).[CITATION-103] Kolozsv\u00e1r University found itself in \u2018exile\u2019 in Romania, meaning that the university had to be re-founded in Szeged in 1921, while the University of Pozsony found itself in Czechoslovak territory.[CITATION-104] Throughout the 1920s, Hungarian critics of Trianon forcefully cited the dislocation caused by the treaty and the importance of intellectual sites in underpinning Hungarian national identity in order to make the case for treaty revision. In 1921 the Hungarian Academy of Letters and Sciences issued an \u2018Address to the Academies of the World\u2019 which described the \u2018vandalism with which the neighbouring nations demolish monuments of art and of historic interest in the territories severed from Hungary by the Treaty of Trianon\u2019.[CITATION-105] Advocates of revision of the Treaty of Trianon understood the value of mobilising cultural loss to make their case to educated international opinion. Oliver E\u00f6ttev\u00e9nyi argued that Hungarian cultural life \u2018was mutilated by the Treaty of Trianon\u2019.[CITATION-106] Similarly, Count P\u00e1l Teleki emphasised Hungary\u2019s cultural contributions to Europe and its historic role as a defender of western \u2018civilisation\u2019.[CITATION-107] The post-war treaties were inconsistent in their attitudes towards the redistribution of cultural objects in Central and Eastern Europe. The treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain had, for the most part, granted the wishes of major Allies for restitution of named items. This was not the case when it came to the claims of small states in Central and Eastern Europe, and the drafters of the treaties demonstrated a desire to encourage the resolution of issues after the peace conference, either through bilateral agreements or through the adjudication of the committee of three jurists. Although they were not named in these treaties, cultural objects were frequently included in petitions to the conference by Eastern European states, suggesting that, for them, cultural reparation should be an integral part of the peace settlements.Beyond seeking to reorder the intellectual capital of Europe in line with new boundaries and to compensate certain victims of cultural violence, the post-war treaties also considered expanding the reach of European cultural influence into the Middle East. The Treaty of S\u00e8vres with the former Ottoman Empire, which was never ratified and was subsequently replaced by the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, included a number of cultural articles and sought to address the problem of what would become of the cultural property of former empires. This, in turn, raised difficult questions about the relationship between national self-determination and cultural items that were deemed to be of universal ownership.Archaeology became a major site of national rivalry in the decades prior to the outbreak of the First World War, with Western powers competing to uncover and claim antiquities to underpin their own assertion of civilisational advancement. Much archaeology was premised upon the idea that Europe was the inheritor of ancient civilisation and thus European museums presented a linear path from the Egyptians and Ancient Greeks, through the Roman Empire and the Renaissance, to modern states.[CITATION-108] Archaeology was competitive; for example, French, British, Italian, German and American archaeologists jostled for superiority in excavating sites in Egypt.[CITATION-109] States established archaeological schools and museums near sites of archaeological importance in order to institutionalise their influence in a particular region. As the discussions at the Paris Peace Conference demonstrate, many archaeologists had internalised the idea that indigenous populations were incapable of caring for the antiquities on their territories.The British Academy saw the Paris Peace Conference as an opportunity to lobby for the interests of its members and ensure that they retained access to antique sites in the future. In November 1918, the academy led a joint action by British learned societies, who collectively approved a resolution stating that the peace conference should end the \u2018systematic neglect and destruction of antiquities, and the obstruction of scientific exploration and excavation\u2019 which had prevailed under Ottoman rule.[CITATION-110] Under the lead of the British Academy, a committee of experts called the Archaeological Joint Committee (AJC) was formed to develop a policy and lobby the Foreign Office. The academy\u2019s president, Sir Frederic Kenyon, believed that Britain had \u2018a national responsibility for the records and relics of ancient civilization in those countries\u2019.[CITATION-111] In a memorandum sent to the Foreign Office in January 1919, Kenyon argued for the necessity of international access to antiquities because collections in \u2018England, France, or Italy, for example, can be easily visited by scholars of all countries, and there are large publics in each of these countries who can understand and profit by the exhibition of them\u2019, unlike in the territories of the former Ottoman Empire.[CITATION-112] Kenyon reiterated these thoughts in a private letter to Lord Curzon, leader of the House of Lords and future Foreign Secretary, a few weeks later, arguing that objects such as cuneiform tablets were \u2018useless unless they can be brought to countries where they can be studied\u2019.[CITATION-113] Both Curzon and Balfour were fellows of the Academy, which undoubtedly helped its case.Similar ideas emerged in the United States. In December 1918, James H. Breasted, a key figure in the development of American Egyptology, presented a proposal to the American Historical Association to \u2018safeguard the future of scientific research, exploration and excavation\u2019 in the former Ottoman Empire. Breasted argued that the \u2018Near East \u2026 bequeathed our own civilization to Europe\u2019 but warned that the \u2018processes of normal life\u2019 under the successors to the Ottoman Empire would result in the \u2018wide destruction of ancient monuments\u2019.[CITATION-114] Breasted had a racial worldview which informed his attitudes to both the war and archaeology.[CITATION-115] The archaeologist Howard Crosby Butler wrote a report on the matter as part of his work with the American government\u2019s expert group, The Inquiry. Butler argued that, were independence granted to \u2018the peoples of Anatolia, Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and Arabia \u2026 they would probably interfere with, or hamper, scientific investigation on the part of the foreigners\u2019.[CITATION-116] Both American and British plans reflected a deep-rooted belief that the populations of the former Ottoman Empire could not care for the antiquities in their territories. At the same time, the British Academy also maintained regular correspondence with the Institut de France regarding the organisation of post-war archaeology.[CITATION-117] The British Academy\u2019s plans were furthered by careful cultivation of influential figures in advance of the conference. Kenyon worked with the American archaeologist W.H. Buckler, and they liaised with the Near East experts in both the British and American delegations, ultimately facilitating co-operation between the two delegations in Paris.[CITATION-118] Establishing these connections allowed Kenyon to send a draft of AJC resolutions to Sir Louis Mallet in Paris.[CITATION-119] At the conference, Anglo-American collaboration expanded to encompass the French scholar Ren\u00e9 Cagnat and the Italian academic Roberto Paribeni, who drafted a set of conventions, based on those of the joint committee, for insertion into the Treaty of S\u00e8vres and the League of Nations mandates.[CITATION-120] Kenyon also sent his proposals to Sir Eric Drummond, the incoming Secretary General of the League of Nations, who promised to bring these proposals to the attention of the League\u2019s Council.[CITATION-121] The annex to Article 421 of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres embodied the substance of the British Academy\u2019s recommendations. It established a Law of Antiquities which codified practices around the discovery of antiquities and archaeological excavations. Moreover, it ensured international access to antiquities, as the Turkish government pledged not to \u2018eliminate scholars of any nation without good grounds\u2019.[CITATION-122] Similar clauses were inserted into the British mandate for Palestine (Article 21) and the French mandate for Syria (Article 14).[CITATION-123] The former Ottoman Empire was also a site where wartime debates about cultural destruction by the enemy continued into peacetime. British diplomats were convinced that Germany had looted cultural sites in the Middle East during the conflict, but precise details proved difficult to establish. Arthur Balfour telegrammed Curzon at the end of January 1919 stating that he was \u2018anxious to obtain\u2019 a list of \u2018objects of archaeological interest which may have been removed during the war from Asiatic Turkey to Constantinople or to Berlin or Vienna\u2019.[CITATION-124] The reality was that, while German archaeologists saw the war as an opportunity to conduct research in parts of the Ottoman Empire that previously had been difficult to access, they were careful to ensure that antiquities were protected and saw much propaganda value in this, as they did across Europe.[CITATION-125] Voices indigenous to the former Ottoman Empire were rarely heard. In April 1919, the CRD decided to solicit claims for damages from states and territories who had no representation on the commission. The Kingdom of Hejaz submitted claims for damage to mosques, libraries, rare books and the treasure of the Harem Babaoui.[CITATION-126] This resulted in Article 246 of the Treaty of Versailles, requiring that Germany return an original Koran of the Caliph Othman to the king of the Hejaz. However, this article was based on a claim, made by Sharif Hussein, that the Koran had been presented to the Kaiser by the Ottoman Sultan, which was formally denied by the German government in January 1920 and which was ultimately left unresolved. Article 246 also included a clause, suggested by Britain, that required Germany to return to the United Kingdom the skull of Sultan Mkwawa, a ruler of the Wahehe in East Africa. Mkwawa led a war of resistance against Germany before committing suicide in 1898, with Germany taking his head as a trophy. Confusion over the whereabouts of this skull meant that it was not returned until 1954.[CITATION-127] As Jeremiah J. Garsha has argued, the return of this skull to Britain rather than its country of origin demonstrated that it was \u2018a body part, a historical souvenir, and a tool of colonial control\u2019.[CITATION-128] Archaeological excavations of ex-Ottoman territories by the main Allied states gathered pace in the post-war period. In December 1919, Kenyon announced plans for the establishment of a British School of Archaeology at Jerusalem with the support of the British Academy, the Palestine Exploration Fund and the Foreign Office.[CITATION-129] Breasted established an Oriental Institute at Chicago in 1919, which oversaw archaeological work in the Middle East in the years that followed and led to the establishment of a Chicago House at Luxor, Egypt, in 1931.[CITATION-130] In January 1921 France set up a Permanent Archaeological Mission in its new mandate of Syria which was modelled on those that it had set up in North Africa before the war.[CITATION-131] The fears expressed by figures such as Kenyon and Breasted about access to antiquities did not become a reality in the post-war period, largely thanks to their effective lobbying in Paris.The Inter-Allied Reparation Commission was responsible for ensuring the payment of reparations following the signing of the treaties; thus, it inherited many of the cultural issues that had been discussed at Paris. The early 1920s demonstrated that these issues would remain contentious; politicians and media in different countries exerted pressure to expedite the return of different cultural objects and ensure that treaty obligations were enacted. At the same time, the economic difficulties caused by post-war conditions led to cultural objects taking on new monetary value and being used as security for the issuing of international loans. Culture remained an important component of international relations not only through the execution of reparations, but also through the emergence of cultural treaties between states.[CITATION-132] The Reparation Commission was populated by representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Italy, with Belgium, Yugoslavia and Japan invited for discussion of specific issues.[CITATION-133] It was tasked with establishing the extent of damage to be claimed in each state by assessing a wide range of claims. The commission was also responsible for collecting payments from the vanquished states, establishing payment schedules, and then dividing payments among the Allied states to whom they were due. In most cases, national committees were formed that gathered data specific to that state before feeding it up into the inter-Allied body. An early plan for the structure of the Reparation Commission envisaged it having a Reparation-in-Kind Service, which was charged with overseeing \u2018restitution and reparation of objects of artistic, historic or scientific interest\u2019.[CITATION-134] The restoration of cultural objects to France became a major political issue in the summer of 1920. While the return of the Cer\u00e7ay papers was unproblematic, the flags were delayed.[CITATION-135] In August 1920, Louis de Maud\u2019huy, a native of Metz and deputy for the Moselle department, criticised the government for the slow progress in the Chamber of Deputies of the restitution of objects under Article 245.[CITATION-136] By then, plans had developed for the interment of the unknown soldier at the Arc de Triomphe and the burial of the heart of L\u00e9on Gambetta at the Panth\u00e9on in Paris on 11 November 1920, to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the French Third Republic. The government, and the foreign minister, Aristide Briand, came under political and media pressure to secure the return of the flags surrendered by General Bazaine in October 1870. In mid-October 1920, for example, the deputy Henri Galli wrote that the inclusion of the flags would complete France\u2019sand urged their return.[CITATION-137] They were ultimately returned for the ceremony of 11 November, wheredescribed the scene: \u2018fifteen flags are brought around the altar; returned to us by the enemy, they lean towards the great heart of Gambetta\u2019.[CITATION-138] Unambiguously, this was about victory and the spoils of war.Germany quickly restored the items mentioned in Article 247 to Belgium. The restitution of books, manuscripts and incunabula was a difficult task; a committee at Louvain liaised with German representatives over the course of twelve months to establish the value of destroyed items and identify replacements. By the time the foundation stone of the new building was laid on 28 July 1921, 198,000 printed volumes had been returned to Louvain, many sourced from the personal collections of recently deceased German professors. A German committee also searched the open market as well as private collections to identify manuscripts and incunabula, presenting lists to representatives of Louvain for their selection.[CITATION-139] Books and other property to the value of 2,186,084 gold marks were returned to Belgium under the terms of Article 247.[CITATION-140] The two other items named in Article 247, by Van Eyck and Bouts respectively, were both restored to Belgium quickly; the Van Eyck \u2018Adoration of the Mystic Lamb\u2019 was part of a touring exhibition which began in Brussels in August 1920 and concluded in Ghent. An account published in a French periodical claimed that the return of this item caused joy not only to art experts, but also to the crowd, who saw in it \u2018the symbol of the justice of their cause [and] an homage to their suffering and their energy\u2019.[CITATION-141] In the cases of France and Belgium, the restoration of named items in articles 245 and 247 was relatively straightforward, and once returned, they were utilised in ceremonials to reinforce the victory over Germany.The resolution of claims in the Treaty of Saint-Germain was more complicated than the equivalent terms in the Treaty of Versailles. Article 195 of Saint-Germain established the principle that Italy, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and Poland could submit claims for \u2018objects or manuscripts\u2019 that had been carried off by the House of Habsburg to a committee of three jurists. In February 1921 the commission appointed J. Fischer Williams, Jacques Lyon and Hugh A. Bayne, all of whom were members of the legal service of the Reparation Commission, to these posts.[CITATION-142] Only two issues reached the committee of jurists, as the other named issues in Article 195 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain were resolved in bilateral agreements.[CITATION-143] Belgium had submitted a number of claims for inclusion in the treaty with Austria, none of which related to war damage. These claims covered the Treasure of the Order of the Golden Fleece and the Triptych of Saint Ildephonse by Rubens, among other items which were taken to Vienna in 1794 to be held in safety from the approaching French armies but were never returned.[CITATION-144] The Belgian government claimed that these claims concerned historic injustices \u2018for which public conscience demands reparation\u2019, which was \u2018fully justified\u2019 by Austria\u2019s artillery intervention against Belgian forts in August 1914.[CITATION-145] The jurists delivered their report in October 1921, where they dismissed Belgium\u2019s claims, finding that the items were the historic private property of the Habsburg dynasty rather than of a nation.[CITATION-146] Claims made by the Czechoslovak state for the return of documents and art from Vienna\u2014including the imperial crown of Rudolf II\u2014were dismissed for similar reasons.[CITATION-147] The drafters of the Treaty of Saint-Germain hoped that the contentious issues relating to the repatriation of cultural objects following the collapse of the Habsburg Empire would be resolved through bilateral agreements which operated on the premise of reciprocity. In the years that followed, Austria signed agreements with Czechoslovakia and Romania for the return of archives, before a general convention was agreed between Austria, Italy, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1922.[CITATION-148] Austria\u2019s position in these negotiations was weak, meaning that it was often dependent on the goodwill of its neighbours. The result was that, in the words of the German archivist Ernst Posner, \u2018the modern holdings of the Vienna archives have been torn apart in a most undesirable way\u2019.[CITATION-149] While bilateral agreements and the work of the Reparation Commission seemed to be taking care of the business of enacting treaty provisions, events in Austria overtook them and reopened many of the cultural issues of Saint-Germain. Austria had faced catastrophic food shortages from early in the First World War, and these continued into peacetime.[CITATION-150] On his return to Austria at the end of the war, the writer Stefan Zweig noted that \u2018there was no flour, bread, or oil; there appeared to be no solution other than a revolution or some other catastrophe\u2019.[CITATION-151] Appeals by international agencies on behalf of Vienna enlisted the city\u2019s historic importance as a centre of European civilisation in their support.[CITATION-152] F.O. Lindley, the British High Commissioner in Vienna, remarked that \u2018it is a tragic thing to see a great centre of culture and decent civilisation on the brink of complete ruin\u2019.[CITATION-153] With Austria bankrupt and unable to buy the supplies it needed to feed its population, a number of loan schemes emerged in 1919 and 1920.[CITATION-154] One of these utilised an Austrian national resource\u2014its art collections.The idea of selling historic collections\u2014specifically Gobelin and Arras tapestries which belonged to the collections of the former imperial palaces\u2014seems to have first emerged in late 1919.[CITATION-155] In December, Lord Curzon told the House of Lords that a decision to use valuable pictures as security for loans to Austria had been taken on the advice of the board of trustees of the British National Gallery; it would ensure that these paintings were not sold by the Austrian state to raise funds \u2018at knock-down prices\u2019, as this would constitute \u2018a scandal to the art-loving world\u2019.[CITATION-156] On 15 December 1920, the Austrian minister of finance formally asked permission of the Austrian Section of the Reparation Commission to pledge certain named artworks held by the state, including Gobelin tapestries, \u2018in order to procure funds to pay for foodstuffs\u2019.[CITATION-157] There was initially some reticence on all sides about the morality and the practicality of using artworks for this purpose. Following a meeting regarding a potential loan between the Austrian finance minister, Viktor Kienb\u00f6ck, and the House of Morgan, the American financiers expressed their fears that the arrangement could be viewed as \u2018pawn broking\u2019.[CITATION-158] In February 1921, Thornely Gibson of the British delegation to the Austrian Section of the Reparation Commission stated his fear that the Austrian proposals could flood an already depressed art market with tapestries. Gibson also feared that the legal ownership of the various collections was \u2018a problem of extreme intricacy\u2019.[CITATION-159] The pledging of artworks needed to be undertaken in a manner consistent with the Treaty of Saint-Germain, but its language proved ambiguous. The interpretation of Lord Sumner\u2019s Article 196 hinged on its definition of \u2018collections\u2019: some departments of the Austrian government took \u2018collections\u2019 to include only items that had been publicly displayed, while others took it to mean all state possessions, irrespective of whether they had been publicly displayed.[CITATION-160] The legal service was later called upon to decide whether the Reparation Commission was entitled to arrange for art to be pledged as part of the \u2018special arrangements\u2019 that would permit collections to be dispersed within the twenty-year period stipulated by Article 196. It was determined that the commission could not do this, but that it could facilitate bilateral agreements between Austria and other states.[CITATION-161] The prospect of tapestries being pledged against a loan elicited much negative feeling in Austria, demonstrating their perceived national importance. In December 1921, a number of learned societies in Vienna protested against the pledging of the Gobelins. They met with the Federal Chancellor, Johannes Schober, who decided that the tapestries would not leave Vienna either by sale or as security for a loan.[CITATION-162] In February 1922, a representative of Lord Curzon wrote to the Austrian Minister in London, G. Franckenstein, committing the British government to provide a loan of \u00a32,250,000, with certain Gobelin tapestries being pledged as security, in accordance with Article 197 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain.[CITATION-163] The Austrian government agreed to these terms on the understanding that the tapestries would not physically leave Austria.[CITATION-164] Additional short-term loans were provided by the French, Italian and Czechoslovak governments on similar terms.[CITATION-165] In July 1923 it was reported that the Gobelin tapestries had been restored to the Austrian government.[CITATION-166] The Reparation Commission inherited the cultural provisions of the treaties and had to ensure that items were restored in the years following the peace conference. This was a difficult task; public expectations were raised in countries such as Belgium and France about the return of items that would underscore their sense of victory in the conflict, while in Austria, even during a period of mass economic disruption, there was much public opposition to the removal of artworks from state collections. The work of the Reparation Commission, particularly in Austria, demonstrated the coming together of the issues of reparations and culture; the pledging of artworks as securities against loans involved not only their symbolic worth, but also their monetary value.Writing in 1932, the Greek legal scholar Stelio S\u00e9f\u00e9riad\u00e8s argued, with reference to the cultural reparation clauses in the treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain, that, had the Parthenon Marbles been ceded not to Lord Elgin but to Austria or Germany, \u2018the last peace treaties would not have failed to order their repatriation to Greece; they constitute an integral part of the intellectual patrimony of this country, more than any other artwork whose return was stipulated to its country of origin\u2019.[CITATION-167] S\u00e9f\u00e9riad\u00e8s\u2019s argument demonstrated the arbitrary nature of the post-war cultural settlements, which gave limited satisfaction to the victors of the war but left many others without any sense of justice. As recently as February 2020 the Greek government suggested making the return of the Parthenon Marbles from Britain part of the demands of the European Union in its trade talks with the United Kingdom.[CITATION-168] The language of 1919 has survived to the present day too; many modern-day museum professionals argue against the repatriation of objects from European and North American museums to formerly colonised territories by citing the importance of these institutions as \u2018universal\u2019 museums, much as defenders of Viennese collections did during the Paris Peace Conference.[CITATION-169] Discussions about cultural issues at the peace conference formed some of its most contentious points and demonstrated the complexity of negotiations about reparations and the property of former empires. The process by which claims were put forward by a range of actors highlights the importance placed on cultural objects in underpinning new or reconstituted states. These claims were generally discussed, adopted and resolved via mechanisms which had been created to deal with economic matters, rather than cultural ones. Victor states expected restitution for wartime damage to cultural sites or to right what they saw as historic wrongs; for France and Belgium this was not an exhaustive list, but it encompassed a number of symbolic and emotionally resonant examples. Italy\u2019s claims\u2014and pre-emptive action in Vienna\u2014were unusual in their extent and saw the return of much art that had originated in Italy, but the anxiety of the peacemakers to avoid the dismemberment of Austrian collections meant that Italy\u2019s experience was exceptional. Extensive claims made on the cultural resources of the former Habsburg Empire by Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, for example, were diluted in the final settlements by general rather than specific provisions and the institution of the committee of three jurists. This protected Vienna\u2019s elevated status as a \u2018centre\u2019 of civilisation; however, it also reveals much about the importance of culture to new states. This was made apparent through the restitution of named, historic objects which were seen as underpinning claims to civilisational advancement and national identity in the case of Poland and Czechoslovakia, and also Greece\u2019s claims against Bulgaria. It was also apparent in the claims of the Yugoslav state, which sought not named items from Austria but a proportional share of its intellectual resources to serve Yugoslavia\u2019s newly enlarged territory and population. The same idea can be seen in the appeals of Hungary, which protested against not only its territorial losses in the Treaty of Trianon, but also its intellectual losses.The cultural articles of the post-war treaties constitute a relatively unknown part of the story of reparations. The vast majority of cultural reparation clauses were discussed and drafted in the CRD, and the Inter-Allied Reparation Commission inherited their subsequent enforcement. This is important because the broader logic of reparations was often invoked to make determinations about cultural matters, as in the case of the Treaty of Neuilly not containing references to the restitution of specific items. When it came to cultural issues, the Paris Peace Conference demonstrated the persistence of a Eurocentric view of the world where damage to Western European cultural sites was understood as intrinsically more important than that which took place further east.While the five treaties were not consistent in their treatment of cultural matters, the settlements established some important precedents for the future of cultural heritage. In the decades that followed, a number of initiatives sought to strengthen norms concerning the protection of cultural property, such as the draft Rules of Aerial Warfare (1923), the Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments (1931) and the draft treaty for the International Museums Office, developed by the League of Nations (1938).[CITATION-170] In his formulation of the idea of genocide, Raphael Lemkin placed a particular emphasis on the destruction of the culture of a people as well as mass killing.[CITATION-171] These were all essential precursors to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. However, to see the post-First World War treaties only in terms of longer-term legal precedents is to overlook their immediate contexts and the way that they were shaped by the logic of reparations, an uneven commitment to self-determination, the persistence of thinking in terms of civilisational hierarchies, and the ability of key actors to shape thinking on certain issues. By examining the process by which these treaties were developed and implemented, the symbolic and monetary value of cultural heritage to European societies can be better understood. Cultural claims were not dealt with in a consistent manner by the treaty drafters, reflecting rather their own understanding of who had suffered most in the war as well as for what the war had been fought. Finally, the treaties demonstrated that culture had become part of the process through which the world order was to be refashioned."

    "title": "\u2018Take Power\u2014Vote Liberal\u2019: Jeremy Thorpe, the 1974 Liberal Revival, and the Politics of 1970s Britain*",
    "author": "Peter Sloman",
    "date": "22 February 2023",
    "text": "The Liberal Party\u2019s 1972\u20134 revival under Jeremy Thorpe placed it at the heart of political debate in 1970s Britain\u2014a period marked by inflation, strikes, and recurrent talk of political \u2018crisis\u2019. This article explores the evolution of Liberal policy, strategy, and support between 1970 and 1979, and argues that Thorpe and his colleagues were agents as well as beneficiaries of electoral dealignment. As long-standing critics of class politics, Liberals were well placed to exploit voters\u2019 frustrations with Edward Heath and Harold Wilson and to articulate demands for a more collaborative and participatory style of government. Thorpe\u2019s populist critique of the two-party system was backed up by a distinctive plan for economic and political renewal, in which social, industrial, and constitutional reforms would give governments the legitimacy to make incomes policies work. These ideas resonated strongly in the two 1974 general elections, but the Liberals\u2019 new-found support was relatively shallow, and Thorpe\u2019s appeal was waning even before the Norman Scott affair forced his 1976 resignation. The 1970s Liberal revival nevertheless laid important political foundations which the SDP/Liberal Alliance would build on after 1981, as it sought to articulate a centrist alternative to Thatcherism.On Monday 2 September 1974, the Liberal Party leader, Jeremy Thorpe, stopped off in a rain-soaked Brighton as part of a pre-election tour of English coastal resorts. Three days earlier, Thorpe\u2019s attempt to appeal to late-summer holidaymakers had descended into farce when his hovercraft ran aground on Sidmouth beach, but at Brighton he offered a sober warning about Britain\u2019s mounting economic difficulties.[CITATION-1] His flamboyant style, he explained to ainterviewer, was designed to draw attention to a \u2018deadly serious\u2019 message: \u2018we are living beyond our means, the Government is borrowing more than it could ever hope to repay, our debts are accumulating to the tune of \u00a34,500 million annually and there is no single panacea which can rescue us\u2019.[CITATION-2] If the coming October election produced another hung Parliament, the Liberals would seek to form a Government of National Unity in order to \u2018save the country from the perils of bankruptcy, poverty and unemployment\u2019. Unless the UK\u2019s democratic leaders took \u2018a grip on its affairs\u2019, Thorpe warned, then \u2018less discerning individuals\u2019 would \u2018have no scruples about using more painful instruments of repression\u2019 to tackle the nation\u2019s problems.[CITATION-3] The 1970s is widely remembered as a turning point in post-war British history: a period when inflation and trade union militancy led to a crisis of confidence in the post-war settlement and helped open the door for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s election victory in 1979. Political narratives of the decade have tended to be structured around a series of failures of governance\u2014the 1973\u20134 energy crisis, the 1976 International Monetary Fund (IMF) application, and the 1978\u20139 \u2018Winter of Discontent\u2019\u2014from which the Thatcher government\u2019s monetarist experiment offered a divisive but politically successful way out.[CITATION-4] As historians such as Lawrence Black and Hugh Pemberton have pointed out, however, the prevailing view of the 1970s as a \u2018benighted decade\u2019 is itself a politically constructed one, which risks obscuring more complex patterns of social and cultural change and foreclosing the possibility of different outcomes.[CITATION-5] On the one hand, electoral dealignment and fears of \u2018the break-up of Britain\u2019 can be seen as symptoms of a larger cultural shift in which class-based identities and established social institutions were disrupted by the decline of \u2018deference\u2019 and the rise of \u2018popular individualism\u2019.[CITATION-6] On the other hand, we also need to pay close attention to the complex temporalities of the decade and the political contingencies involved in the coming of Thatcherism.Recent accounts of the construction of \u2018crisis\u2019 in 1970s Britain have largely focused on Conservative politicians and their supporters in the press\u2014as, for instance, in Camilla Schofield\u2019s study of Enoch Powell, Robert Saunders\u2019s work on Margaret Thatcher, and Colin Hay\u2019s influential analysis of the \u2018Winter of Discontent\u2019.[CITATION-7] As Jim Tomlinson has noted, however, \u2018declinism\u2019 was by no means confined to the political right, but \u2018became the common currency of British politics in the 1970s\u2019.[CITATION-8] As Conservative and Labour governments struggled to respond to the UK\u2019s economic challenges, Liberals, Marxist radicals, and Scottish and Welsh nationalists all gained political traction and played an important role in fostering a sense of political dislocation.[CITATION-9] Thorpe\u2019s Brighton speech shows that even Liberal politicians sometimes couched their appeal in an apocalyptic register.The re-emergence of the Liberal Party as a significant electoral force was one of the most important political developments in 1970s Britain. In the general election of February 1974, the Liberals won more than six million votes (19.3 per cent of the total) and helped remove Edward Heath\u2019s government from office; in October 1974 they ran 619 candidates, took 18.3 per cent of the vote, and confirmed their renewed political relevance. Though the party struggled to convert these votes into parliamentary seats, returning fourteen MPs in February and thirteen in October, the tight results produced by the two elections gave the small band of Liberals significant weight in the House of Commons.[CITATION-10] Between March 1977 and July 1978, Thorpe\u2019s successor David Steel and his colleagues sustained Jim Callaghan\u2019s government in power through the \u2018Lib\u2013Lab Pact\u2019\u2014the first such formal inter-party agreement since the Second World War.[CITATION-11] Even as Liberal support declined during the late 1970s, the party remained a significant factor in Labour and Conservative calculations. Indeed, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s success in winning over between one-quarter and two-fifths of October 1974 Liberal voters was one of the foundations of her 1979 election victory.[CITATION-12] To date, however, the Thorpe-era Liberal revival has received surprisingly little attention from historians. The only full-length study of the party in the 1970s\u2014a 1999 Ph.D. thesis by Ruth Fox\u2014remains unpublished, and other analysis is largely confined to biographies (such as Michael Bloch\u2019s life of Thorpe), general surveys of the party\u2019s history and political thought (such as Tudor Jones\u2019s study of(2011)), and specialist articles in the.[CITATION-13] One possible reason for this neglect is that contemporary political scientists tended to see the upsurge in Liberal support largely as a protest vote. If Disraeli\u2019s working-class Conservatives were \u2018angels in marble\u2019, then 1974 Liberal voters were \u2018angels in plastic\u2019, drawn to the party by disillusionment with Heath and by Thorpe\u2019s charismatic image rather than any deeper Liberal commitment.[CITATION-14] A second problem is that the Liberals fell short of their stated goals of \u2018realignment\u2019 and electoral reform, both during the 1970s and in the subsequent Alliance with the Social Democratic Party (1981\u20138). As a result, the party\u2019s electoral gains under Thorpe and Steel have been overshadowed by a sense of ultimate strategic failure.[CITATION-15] Perceptions of Thorpe\u2019s leadership have also, understandably, been coloured by the Norman Scott affair, which culminated in his resignation in 1976 and trial in 1979 on the charge of conspiracy to murder. Posthumous allegations of child sexual abuse against the Liberal MPs Cyril Smith and Clement Freud have further damaged the party\u2019s reputation. The stench of scandal here is strong\u2014indeed, nauseating. Although most Liberals seem to have known little or nothing about these activities until they became public knowledge,published a report about Smith\u2019s conduct as early as 1979, and the recent Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) has strongly criticised David Steel for failing to launch a full investigation.[CITATION-16] The IICSA report raises troubling questions about the party\u2019s internal culture and procedures during the 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, these issues are not the focus of the present work, which looks instead at the party\u2019s public face. After all, the dark underbelly of the 1970s Liberal Party can only be properly understood against the backdrop of the party\u2019s political appeal, campaigns, and objectives.This article therefore re-examines the 1970s Liberal revival in order to establish the nature and significance of the party\u2019s breakthrough in 1974. In particular, it seeks to move beyond a personalised focus on Thorpe to explore how the party as a whole navigated the shifting social, economic and cultural landscape of 1970s Britain, and to see the party not as a passive beneficiary of \u2018dealignment\u2019 but as an active political agent. As Camilla Schofield has argued, \u2018the decline of class\u2019 was mediated by language and political argument, and thus, \u2018at least to some extent, arather thantransformation\u2019.[CITATION-17] As long-standing critics of \u2018class politics\u2019, Liberals were well placed to give voice to voters\u2019 frustration with both Conservative and Labour governments, and to tap into the \u2018growing desire to emphasize individuality, authenticity, and ordinariness\u2019 which Florence Sutcliffe-Braithwaite has identified in vernacular culture during this period.[CITATION-18] Younger voters seem to have been particularly attracted by the Liberals, perhaps because of Thorpe\u2019s forthright embrace of progressive causes from Europe and immigrants\u2019 rights to racial and sexual equality. At its peak, however, the party\u2019s critique of \u2018adversary politics\u2019 resonated well beyond the ranks of young idealists and metropolitan intellectuals. Under Thorpe, the Liberals pitched their appeal not only at \u2018People Who Think For Themselves\u2019 (as Jo Grimond\u2019s posters had put it in 1964) but at a broad swathe of disillusioned voters, framing a Liberal vote as an opportunity to \u2018Take Power\u2019 and \u2018Change the Face of Britain\u2019. The Liberals\u2019 strong performance in the two elections of 1974 reminds us that feelings of \u2018powerlessness\u2019 and alienation from governing elites were politically mutable, and could be given shape by liberal as well as conservative forms of populism.The article develops this argument in six main steps. The first section sets the scene by placing the Liberal Party in the wider social and political context of early 1970s Britain, including the cultural tensions brought to the fore by Enoch Powell\u2019s \u2018Rivers of Blood\u2019 speech, and examines how younger activists sought to revive Liberal fortunes after the disastrous 1970 election through campaign-oriented \u2018community politics\u2019. A second section unpacks the Liberal response to the economic challenges which Britain faced during the Heath years, and argues that the party\u2019s 1974 campaigns were rooted in a coherent (if somewhat technocratic) vision of a reconstructed post-war settlement. The third and fourth sections trace the revival of the party\u2019s electoral fortunes from the by-election victories of 1972\u20133 to the general elections of February and October 1974. The fifth section explores how core elements of the Liberal agenda\u2014particularly interest in electoral reform and \u2018national unity\u2019\u2014continued to shape political debate into the later 1970s, but were ultimately squeezed out by the more assertive \u2018conviction politics\u2019 of Mrs Thatcher. Finally, the conclusion reflects on the wider implications of the Liberal revival for our understanding of post-war British politics.The Liberal Party began the 1970s in a parlous state. In the election of June 1970\u2014Thorpe\u2019s first as leader\u2014the party lost six of the twelve seats which it had won four years earlier, and Thorpe himself only clung on in North Devon by 369 votes. If the landslide Labour victory in 1966 had dashed Jo Grimond\u2019s hopes of a \u2018realignment of the left\u2019, the unpopularity of Harold Wilson\u2019s government in the final years of the decade left the Liberals adrift, caught out by a rising tide of conservatism. Thorpe spent much of the 1970 campaign accusing Edward Heath of moving \u2018further and further to the right\u2019 under pressure from Enoch Powell, whom he described as \u2018stark staring bonkers\u2019, but the Tory victory suggested that many voters were unperturbed.[CITATION-19] Eric Lubbock\u2019s defeat at Orpington, which he had won in a famous by-election in 1962, set the seal on the Liberal reverse. \u2018[A]fter a decade of struggle to break back into the mainstream of British political life\u2019, Peter Fiddick noted in, the Liberals had been reduced to \u2018a tiny rump\u2019 and were \u2018once more the party of the Celtic fringe\u2019.[CITATION-20] agreed, and predicted that if the Heath government performed even \u2018reasonably well\u2019 there was \u2018no likelihood of the Liberals being able to make any impact\u2019 in the coming Parliament.[CITATION-21] The Liberals\u2019 poor performance in 1970 partly stemmed from the weakness of Thorpe\u2019s campaign\u2014Peter Hain, then a leading Young Liberal activist, thought the manifesto was \u2018shoddy, incoherent, and totally negative\u2019\u2014but it also reflected the party\u2019s traditional vulnerability to a Conservative recovery in rural and suburban areas.[CITATION-22] In the economic sphere, the Liberals had shared fully in the \u2018growthmanship\u2019 of the early 1960s, which came to seem increasingly na\u00efve during the second half of the decade; in the social and cultural sphere, the party was associated with the \u2018permissive\u2019 agenda, most notably through David Steel\u2019s role in introducing the 1967 Abortion Act and Thorpe\u2019s vocal support for Commonwealth immigration.[CITATION-23] As the Cambridge historian John Vincent had warned when Thorpe became leader, these progressive views sat uncomfortably with prevailing cultural norms in some of the \u2018up-country\u2019 seats which Liberal MPs represented.[CITATION-24] Richard Wainwright blamed Tory campaigning on crime and immigration for his defeat in Colne Valley, and some members of the party\u2019s national executive felt that \u2018Liberals\u2019 association with \u2026 so-called \u201cpermissive society\u201d measures\u2019 had become an electoral liability.[CITATION-25] The challenges posed by the cultural politics of the late 1960s were amplified by two areas in which the Liberals had shown signs of growth during the early years of Thorpe\u2019s leadership. Firstly, the Young Liberal Movement (YLs) had boomed as a result of an influx of left-leaning students who were attracted by Thorpe\u2019s attacks on apartheid and angered by the Wilson government\u2019s equivocations over the Vietnam War.[CITATION-26] Attempts to commit the party to an anti-NATO stance at its 1966 Assembly led the media to label YL activists as \u2018Red Guards\u2019, and the leading role which Hain and other YLs played in the Stop the Seventy Tour campaign against the white South African cricket team kept the movement in the limelight in the run-up to the 1970 election. Some older Liberals, such as Arthur Slack of the National Union of Liberal Clubs, blamed the YLs for the party\u2019s losses in 1970, and matters came to a head later in the year when the former YL chairman Louis Eaks was widely accused of stoking antisemitism.[CITATION-27] Thorpe responded by commissioning Stephen Terrell QC to lead a controversial and largely fruitless inquiry into the YLs and their relationship with the wider party.[CITATION-28] A second area of Liberal growth lay in the party\u2019s efforts to expand its local government presence from small towns and seaside resorts to inner-city areas, especially those where Labour\u2019s political organisation had decayed through neglect, industrial decline, or unpopular rehousing schemes.[CITATION-29] The most striking example of this progress came in Birmingham, where Wallace Lawler won Newtown ward in 1962, turned it into a political base, and then gained Birmingham Ladywood from Labour in a 1969 parliamentary by-election.[CITATION-30] Lawler, a plastics manufacturer, described himself as \u2018an unofficial Ombudsman for the whole of the city\u2019 and built up his profile through populist campaigns\u2014for instance, by taking a thousand Birmingham pensioners to Downing Street to protest against rising electricity charges.[CITATION-31] Yet this \u2018rebirth of working-class Liberalism\u2019\u2014as Brian Priestley of theput it\u2014came with a sting in the tail, as Lawler broke from the party\u2019s liberal line on immigration to complain about \u2018ugly problems\u2019 of overcrowding and venereal disease among immigrant groups, and called for labour permits in Birmingham to be restricted until these problems were solved.[CITATION-32] Lawler\u2019s flirtation with nativism was by no means typical of Liberal councillors, but a 1971 row over a traveller site in Barnsley suggested that it was not an isolated case.[CITATION-33] At a time of widespread anxieties over race and cultural change, a populist commitment to local representation could easily undercut the party\u2019s efforts to position itself as the champion of other liberal principles.Despite its small size, then, Thorpe\u2019s party found itself straddling the social and cultural divides which fractured late 1960s Britain, as MPs representing far-flung rural seats rubbed up against student radicals, middle-class professionals and inner-city activists.[CITATION-34] What held these groups together was a shared desire to keep the Liberal Party alive as an independent force. Indeed, the near-death experience of 1970 galvanised new efforts at co-ordination. Perhaps most importantly, some of the more pragmatic Young Liberals\u2014led by the new YL chairman Tony Greaves and vice-chairman Gordon Lishman\u2014began to throw their energies into local activism, and drew on New Left ideas about direct action and \u2018maximum feasible participation\u2019 in order to flesh out a liberal theory of \u2018community politics\u2019.[CITATION-35] At the 1970 Assembly in Eastbourne, Greaves and Lishman successfully amended a resolution on \u2018Party Strategy and Tactics\u2019 to commit the Liberals to \u2018a dual approach to politics, acting both inside and outside the institutions of the political establishment \u2026 to help organize people in communities to take and use power; to use our political skills to redress grievances; and to represent people at all levels of the political structure\u2019. The national party would support the effort to build \u2018a Liberal power base in the major cities of this country\u2019 by taking \u2018an aggressive political lead on issues of moral concern, injustice and oppression\u2019, identifying the Liberals with \u2018the underprivileged of this country and the world\u2019 and using these campaigns \u2018to publicise Liberal attitudes and policies\u2019. In due course, this strategy would prepare the party to fight the next general election \u2018on the broadest possible front\u2019.[CITATION-36] The community politics strategy which emerged during the early 1970s opened up common ground between New Left-influenced YLs and urban councillors, and helped shift the focus of the party\u2019s activities from Parliament to local government and the regions. Lishman wrote a \u2018community politics guide\u2019 for circulation to local parties, and the party set out to target major gains in the 1973 local elections, when voters in England and Wales would elect members of the new county and district councils created by the 1972 Local Government Act.[CITATION-37] Though Thorpe and other MPs treated the Eastbourne strategy with caution, Richard Wainwright\u2014who had become chairman of the national executive after losing his Colne Valley seat\u2014began to reshape the party\u2019s policy and organisation to support extra-parliamentary campaigning. For instance, during the winter of 1971\u20132 Wainwright launched an \u2018Action on Hardship\u2019 campaign to highlight the party\u2019s concern for low-paid workers, while the YLs ran a campaign on the \u2018Urban Crisis\u2019 which called for a new participatory approach to housing and planning.[CITATION-38] Wainwright hoped to use these campaigns to build links with the \u2018poverty lobby\u2019 groups which had emerged in response to the \u2018rediscovery of poverty\u2019 during the 1960s, such as Shelter and the Child Poverty Action Group.[CITATION-39] The initial response from the voluntary sector was \u2018not \u2026 very favourable\u2019, but the campaigns seem to have helped re-engage some wavering party members.[CITATION-40] David Steel also persuaded Shelter\u2019s founding director Des Wilson to join the party in order to stand as the Liberal candidate for Hove in a 1973 by-election.[CITATION-41] High-intensity \u2018pavement politics\u2019 yielded its biggest dividends in Liverpool, where Cyril Carr and Trevor Jones usedleaflets and \u2018grumble sheets\u2019 to exploit voters\u2019 frustration with poor housing conditions and other council services. Decades of often sectarian \u2018boss politics\u2019 provided an ideal foil for Liberal activism, and the Liberal group grew from four councillors in 1970 to forty-six in 1973, when the party supplanted Labour to form a minority administration.[CITATION-42] Greaves, a geography teacher at Colne Grammar School, put similar techniques into practice in his home borough of Pendle, where the Liberals also became the largest party.[CITATION-43] Across the country as a whole, the 1973 elections saw more than 1,400 Liberal councillors elected, about 6 per cent of the total, as the party took control of Eastbourne and held the balance of power in several other boroughs, including Leeds and Bury.[CITATION-44] By this point, the national political mood was also turning strongly in the Liberals\u2019 favour.The Liberals\u2019 experiments in community politics took place against the backdrop of the Heath government\u2019s efforts to achieve a \u2018quiet revolution\u2019 in the British economy by cutting taxes, taming trade union power, and unleashing the dynamism of the private sector.[CITATION-45] Heath\u2019s concern about the political impact of rising unemployment in 1971\u20132 prompted his famous \u2018u-turn\u2019 towards reflation, with the \u2018Barber boom\u2019 accompanied by a statutory incomes policy and repeated efforts to reach a bargain with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Trades Union Congress (TUC). Keith Middlemas has characterised 1972\u20134 as the last and boldest attempt to reverse the UK\u2019s relative economic decline through corporatist co-operation: \u2018a strategic attempt to rethink the nature of \u2026 the postwar settlement\u2019 which was undermined by bitter rows over the government\u2019s Industrial Relations Act, housing finance reforms and regressive tax policies.[CITATION-46] The OPEC oil embargo and Heath\u2019s confrontation with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) brought matters to a head in the winter of 1973\u20134; indeed, the economist Michael Stewart thought this period \u2018saw the opening up of class divides and the emergence of social antagonisms on a scale probably not witnessed since the General Strike half a century before\u2019.[CITATION-47] Heath\u2019s unpopularity and perceived divisiveness created new opportunities for the Liberals. If the role of the state in a modern economy was to hold the ring between capital and labour, as Heath\u2019s rhetoric increasingly suggested, then the Liberals could reasonably question whether either Labour or the Conservatives were sufficiently independent to define and represent the national interest.[CITATION-48] At the same time, the party\u2019s efforts to reassert its relevance were also aided by the divisions which had opened up in the Labour Party in 1971\u20132, when Roy Jenkins and sixty-eight other MPs defied a three-line whip to vote in favour of entry to the European Economic Community (EEC). Thorpe contrasted the Liberals\u2019 consistent support for Europe with Harold Wilson\u2019s equivocations on the issue, and floated the prospect of drawing Jenkinsites and moderate Tories into a \u2018coalition of the centre\u2019.[CITATION-49] thought that the idea of the Liberals as \u2018the nucleus of a powerful, moderate party\u2019 was a chimera, but William Rees-Mogg ofwas more receptive to the idea, and commissioned a poll in September 1972 which suggested that 35 per cent of voters would support an alliance between the Liberals and Labour moderates.[CITATION-50] (Perhaps more strikingly, 53 per cent agreed that \u2018The present party political system no longer works properly\u2019, and 40 per cent supported the proposition that \u2018If there was a chance of the Liberal Party getting into power, I would vote for them\u2019.) Though Jenkins and his supporters rebuffed the idea, discussions of realignment were kept alive by Dick Taverne\u2019s resignation as a Labour MP after a row with left-wing activists in Lincoln, and his triumphant victory as a \u2018Democratic Labour\u2019 candidate in the resulting March 1973 by-election.[CITATION-51] Since the 1920s, the Conservatives had generally sought to squeeze the Liberals out of British politics in order to monopolise the non-Labour vote; during 1972\u20133, some Tories and right-leaning journalists seem to have switched to talking up the Liberals as a way of encouraging a split in the Labour Party.[CITATION-52] Thorpe\u2019s approach to Liberal leadership was very different to the reflective, policy-oriented style of his predecessor Jo Grimond. Where Grimond had given the party \u2018credibility\u2019, Thorpe toldin September 1973, \u2018my task has been to try to give itcredibility, to prove that it can succeed, that it can win seats, that it can put people into the House of Commons who can do something\u2019.[CITATION-53] As the Bodmin MP Peter Bessell observed, Thorpe was fascinated by organisation and electioneering rather than ideas, and his firm liberal convictions on issues such as decolonisation and civil liberties coexisted with a rather woolly centrism on economic and social policy.[CITATION-54] Given how little attention most voters paid to Liberal policy, such vagueness was not necessarily a disadvantage; indeed, some of the party\u2019s campaign planners thought its \u2018most effective appeal\u2019 was to tap into \u2018the average voter\u2019s natural inclination for real change\u2019 by emphasising that \u2018Liberals can win and are winning\u2019.[CITATION-55] Nevertheless, the party clearly needed to back up its slogans with some policy detail if it was to mount a serious bid for office. Much of this work was undertaken by Wainwright, the Treasury spokesman John Pardoe, the party\u2019s research director Tony Richards, and the former party president Desmond Banks, who took on the newly created voluntary role of \u2018director of policy promotion\u2019.[CITATION-56] The policy package that emerged in 1972\u20133 drew heavily on proposals which had been developed under Grimond a decade earlier, but took on new relevance in a context of growing industrial tension. The party\u2019s economic analysis placed it firmly in the \u2018Keynesian-plus\u2019 mainstream, with the rise in unemployment during 1971 attributed to weak demand and the rising inflation of 1972\u20133 seen primarily as a \u2018cost-push\u2019 phenomenon.[CITATION-57] This focus on wages and prices led the Liberals to offer broad support for the incomes policies imposed by the Wilson and Heath governments, though they frequently criticised the details.[CITATION-58] Working with the industrial relations specialist Michael Fogarty, whose vision of the \u2018just wage\u2019 was strongly influenced by Catholic social teaching, Pardoe argued that the government should use punitive levies on corporation tax and National Insurance contributions to penalise excessive wage and price increases.[CITATION-59] The fundamental problem with Heath\u2019s incomes policy, however, was neither structure nor enforcement but a lack of consent, since the Conservatives had explicitly rejected \u2018the philosophy of compulsory wage control\u2019 in their 1970 manifesto. What was needed (the Liberals argued) was a clear electoral mandate for statutory controls, instead of an endless series of improvised short-term measures.[CITATION-60] Many contemporary commentators interpreted the wage inflation and union militancy of the late 1960s and 1970s in sociological terms. John Goldthorpe, for instance, thought that the rise of the welfare state and the decline of traditional social norms had made younger workers more sensitive to distributional inequalities, and the economist Ralph Turvey believed that \u2018strong feelings of social injustice\u2019 had contributed to the post-1969 \u2018wage explosion\u2019.[CITATION-61] In this political climate, the Heath government\u2019s ability to impose wage restraint appeared to be severely compromised by the Conservative Party\u2019s close relationship with business and the large tax cuts it had given to shareholders and high earners.[CITATION-62] By contrast, the Liberals argued that three sets of radical reforms could ensure that a permanent incomes policy was seen as \u2018fair\u2019.Firstly, the Liberals set out plans for a vigorous assault on poverty through wage regulation and social security changes. A Liberal government would introduce a statutory minimum wage set at two-thirds of average industrial earnings (\u00a324 per week in 1973), raise old age pensions to half average earnings for a married couple, and introduce a \u2018credit income tax\u2019 scheme to provide a minimum income floor for the whole population. Like Labour, the Liberals spoke the language of \u2018social justice\u2019; unlike Labour, the party was less concerned about unionised workers than those whom Thorpe called the \u2018forgotten minorities\u2019\u2014the farm workers, \u2018public servants, pensioners, and other social security beneficiaries\u2019 who lacked the bargaining power to keep pace with rising prices.[CITATION-63] Wainwright and Thorpe used the \u2018Action on Hardship\u2019 campaign to publicise this agenda\u2014for instance, by drawing attention to low pay among lace workers in Nottingham and Securicor security staff in Kent.[CITATION-64] During the election of February 1974 the party went even further by promising to \u2018freeze all rents for at least a year\u2019 in order to help maintain living standards.[CITATION-65] Significantly, the February 1974 manifesto also linked the case for redistribution to the longer-term environmental crisis which had been highlighted by thinkers such as E.F. Schumacher. Since the world\u2019s resources were \u2018limited\u2019 and the UK would need to transition to \u2018an age of stability\u2019 with \u2018controlled economic growth\u2019, it was all the more important to limit \u2018private consumption by the few in favour of better public services for the majority of our citizens\u2019.[CITATION-66] Secondly, the Liberals promised to transform the relationship between workers and employers by making radical changes to corporate structure. Under the label of \u2018co-partnership\u2019, the party proposed to create Works Councils in firms with more than twenty employees, to require firms with more than fifty employees to introduce profit-sharing schemes, and to give employees half the votes (alongside shareholders) in the election of \u2018supervisory boards\u2019. These proposals drew on a longer history of Liberal thinking about partnership which dated back at least as far as David Lloyd George\u2019s \u2018Yellow Book\u2019 on(1928) and had been fleshed out in the 1960s by Peter McGregor, a manager at the engineering firm Ferranti. During 1973, Liberal MPs introduced private members\u2019 bills on the subject in an attempt to capture public attention, and Thorpe claimed that co-partnership would create \u2018a totally new climate in industry\u2019, which would help to solve the UK\u2019s economic problems.[CITATION-67] As Stuart White has pointed out, the Liberals\u2019 plans implied a sharp break with the traditional conception of the capitalist firm, placing significant constraints on managerial autonomy and the pursuit of shareholder value. At the same time, they also attempted to empower workers as individuals, in contrast to the Labour left\u2019s trade union-orientated vision of industrial democracy.[CITATION-68] Thirdly, the Liberals reframed their long-standing commitment to constitutional reform as a response to the new political moment. Proportional representation (PR) remained the party\u2019s main demand, but Thorpe and his colleagues now justified it not only on grounds of fairness but also as a way of restoring the effectiveness and legitimacy of the UK political system. Electoral reform would end the abrupt swings of the pendulum which had destabilised British economic policy since 1964 and encourage a more consensual and \u2018European\u2019 style of government. In line with the principles of community politics, the Liberals also called for a radical devolution of power from Westminster and Whitehall: first to elected parliaments or assemblies in Scotland, Wales, and the English regions, then to local authorities, and finally to neighbourhood councils, which\u2014unlike the districts created by the 1972 Local Government Act\u2014would be small enough to allow for meaningful participation.[CITATION-69] The defence of local particularity against the centralising tendencies of the British state had been a hallmark of Liberal politics since the Second World War, but the 1970s reaction against \u2018bureaucracy\u2019 and \u2018bigness\u2019 gave it broader resonance. Lord Crowther-Hunt and Alan Peacock echoed the Liberal diagnosis in their memorandum of dissent to the 1973 Kilbrandon Report on the Constitution, arguing that sweeping decentralisation was necessary to deal with a \u2018pervading sense of powerlessness\u2019 and \u2018indications of a growing alienation from the governmental system\u2019.[CITATION-70] As the Liberal activist Hannan Rose noted in, the party found, \u2018perhaps to its own surprise\u2019, that \u2018some of its old, well-worn and well-loved tunes\u2019 had finally begun to attract public attention.[CITATION-71] Taken together, these policies added up to an ambitious programme for reconstructing the post-war settlement on new foundations. The Liberal agenda reflected the institutionalist tendencies of British social thought in the 1960s and 1970s, which (in different ways) had shaped both Wilson and Heath\u2019s attempts at \u2018modernisation\u2019.[CITATION-72] There were also links with the \u2018reconstructionist\u2019 ideas of progressive business leaders such as George Goyder and Wilfred Brown\u2014who sought to defuse industrial conflict by restructuring the capitalist firm and placing it within a new social architecture\u2014and with the emerging environmentalist movement.[CITATION-73] Yet the political meaning of this agenda was fundamentally ambiguous. On one level, the 1974 Liberal manifestos came as close as the party had probably ever done to challenging the assumptions of market economics in the name of social justice, building on the communitarianism of the Edwardian New Liberals and the interventionism of \u2018centrist-liberal\u2019 economists such as Keynes and Beveridge.[CITATION-74] At the same time, the party\u2019s interest in redistribution, co-partnership and political reform could also be seen as a way of bolstering the legitimacy of the state and strengthening its ability to face down the unions. If many Liberal activists saw their party through the former lens, some of its sympathisers in the press\u2014such as Rees-Mogg and Bernard Levin in\u2014appear to have been more interested in the latter.[CITATION-75] The upturn in the Liberals\u2019 electoral support was sudden and unexpected. As late as February 1972,saw \u2018no sign of another revival\u2019: the party\u2019s poll ratings had languished in the single digits since the 1970 election, and it had fought only five out of twelve by-elections, losing its deposit in four of them.[CITATION-76] Thorpe\u2019s own performance had been lacklustre since his first wife Caroline died in a tragic post-election car crash, and it was only when the European Communities Bill came to the Commons in early 1972 that he really returned to form.[CITATION-77] Then, as Heath imposed a wage freeze and Labour\u2019s divisions widened, the Liberal by-election bandwagon started rolling. In October 1972, Cyril Smith gained Rochdale from Labour on the basis of a populist local campaign; in December, Graham Tope won the safe Conservative seat of Sutton and Cheam on a 33 per cent swing; and during 1973 the Liberals took the Isle of Ely, Ripon, and Berwick-upon-Tweed from the Tories. This gave them five by-election gains in just over a year, along with three very respectable second places.As Richard Jay has pointed out, the Liberals were \u2018lucky in both the timing and the location of the by-elections\u2019, which allowed them to harness the votes of disillusioned Conservatives just as they had done at Orpington in the early 1960s.[CITATION-78] What was new, however, was the party\u2019s ability to make progress in constituencies where it had no tradition of success and very little local organisation, such as the Labour-held seats of Chester-le-Street and Manchester Exchange, where it came a strong second. In some cases this reflected intensive campaign techniques (pioneered by the Liverpool councillor Trevor Jones and deployed to great effect at Sutton and Cheam) and the personal appeal of strong local candidates, but it also suggested a growing openness to the party\u2019s national message, particularly as class-based loyalties started to wither. The political scientist Michael Steed, who stood as the Liberal candidate at Manchester Exchange, thought that \u2018the key to the mood of the electorate was \u201cthe feeling of utter powerlessness\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-79] Though many male manual workers in the constituency were still Labour partisans, their wives seemed more receptive to Steed\u2019s campaign, not least because of dissatisfaction with the Labour-run city council over housing conditions.[CITATION-80] Peter Hain also detected \u2018a growing feeling of rootlessness\u2019, which went hand in hand with \u2018a deep antipathy towards modern, centralised Party machines\u2019.[CITATION-81] After jumping in the opinion polls during summer 1973 and peaking at 29 per cent with National Opinion Polls (NOP) on 13 October, Liberal support drifted downwards as the winter closed in and the miners\u2019 dispute took hold.[CITATION-82] Some Liberals feared that they would be squeezed out in a \u2018crisis election\u2019; instead, Heath\u2019s decision to call an early poll on the question of \u2018Who governs?\u2019 played straight into the party\u2019s hands.[CITATION-83] The row between the Conservative government and the NUM and the resulting \u2018three-day week\u2019 powerfully dramatised the Liberal claim that adversarial politics had brought the country to a standstill, allowing Thorpe to pose as an honest broker who would \u2018unite the centre\u2019 and \u2018isolate the extremists on the right and left in the national interest\u2019.[CITATION-84] \u2018If we can offer to bring peace to Industry\u2019, he told candidates at the beginning of the three-week campaign, \u2018I believe that Liberals will gain massive support at the Polls\u2019.[CITATION-85] The Liberal campaign for the February election was \u2018patched together very hurriedly in January\u2019, but the momentum which the party had gained over the previous year meant that it fielded more than 500 candidates for the first time since the Second World War, allowing Thorpe to declare that \u2018If you want a Liberal Government you can have one\u2019.[CITATION-86] Thorpe himself spent most of the election in Barnstaple and appeared at press conferences via a specially installed video link, which helped to accentuate his detachment from the verbal dogfight between Heath and Wilson.[CITATION-87] The Liberals also benefited from a relatively generous allocation of party political broadcasts (divided between the parties in a ratio of 5:5:3) and increased television news coverage once the short campaign began: the party \u2018almost doubled its share of news coverage\u2019 compared with 1970, and Thorpe \u2018made skilled use of the nightly opportunity to present a fresh and constructive image\u2019.[CITATION-88] Finally, the party spent over \u00a325,000 on a series of press advertisements and \u2018Take Power\u2019 posters, orchestrated by the advertising executive and Liberal candidate Adrian Slade.[CITATION-89] This campaign was made possible by Thorpe\u2019s success in raising donations from businessmen such as Jack Hayward, many of which he handled directly (or through secretive \u2018direct aid accounts\u2019) and some of which he was later alleged to have misappropriated.[CITATION-90] On polling day, Liberal candidates took 19.3 per cent of the national vote\u2014more than double their 1970 performance\u2014and an average of 24 per cent in the 452 seats they contested in England.[CITATION-91] (The Liberals performed less well in Scotland, and to a lesser extent Wales, where the Conservative vote was more resilient and the nationalist parties offered an alternative vehicle of protest.) The broad geographical spread of Liberal support, however, meant that the party won only fourteen seats: holding three of the five by-election gains, retaking Colne Valley and Bodmin (which had been lost in 1970), and adding the Isle of Wight, Hazel Grove, and Cardigan. Data from the British Election Study (BES) suggests that almost half of the new Liberal voters had not voted in 1970, and that the rest were drawn fairly evenly from Labour and the Conservatives; however, some of the Labour-to-Liberal switchers may have been tactically motivated, since most of the Liberals\u2019 strongest performances (including more than four-fifths of their 146 second places) came in Tory constituencies.[CITATION-92] In particular, the Liberals established themselves as the main challengers to the Conservatives across a broad swathe of southern England, coming second in sixty-eight out of 105 Tory-held seats south of the Thames, and made particularly big strides in London suburbs and commuter seats such as Richmond, Twickenham, and Guildford.[CITATION-93] By contrast, the Liberal results bore little relationship to local government activity, perhaps because the dark February nights were not well suited to pavement politics. Indeed, Liverpool Wavertree\u2014where the incoming council leader Cyril Carr was the Liberal candidate\u2014was one of only two English seats where the Liberal vote share went down.[CITATION-94] Who were the six million Liberal voters? Analysis of the BES and other opinion surveys suggests four main patterns. Firstly, Liberal voters were disproportionately young: for instance, the BES found that 27 per cent of under-25s and 23 per cent of 25- to 34- year-olds supported the Liberals, falling to 10 per cent among those aged 75 and over.[CITATION-95] The Conservative Party\u2019s private polling of 16\u201328 year olds also highlighted \u2018[t]he disruptive effect of the Liberals on the political loyalties of the young\u2019, and suggested that young women and those with \u2018more and higher educational qualifications than the age group as a whole\u2019 were particularly likely to switch to Thorpe\u2019s party.[CITATION-96] Secondly, as in the 1960s, the Liberals did better among the \u2018salariat\u2019 and other white-collar groups than among manual workers.[CITATION-97] Thirdly, Liberal voters gave Thorpe high leadership ratings, particularly compared to Heath, whose battle with the NUM had made him seem both combative and ineffectual. Unlike Heath and Wilson, Thorpe\u2019s ratings ran well ahead of his party\u2019s, supporting the widespread view that his television appearances had been an important asset.[CITATION-98] Fourthly, Liberal voters tended to be less satisfied with the British political system than Labour or Conservative supporters.[CITATION-99] It is difficult to draw broader conclusions about political attitudes, since the February BES survey was relatively short (and therefore light on policy questions), but the October survey suggested that Liberal voters were disproportionately likely to believe that both \u2018big business\u2019 and trade unions had too much power, and held broadly but not overwhelmingly liberal views on issues such as race and women\u2019s equality.[CITATION-100] Thorpe discouraged talk of coalitions during the February 1974 campaign, but assured voters that he was prepared to work with other parties if the election produced a hung Parliament.[CITATION-101] When the results came in, with both Labour (on 301 seats) and the Conservatives (on 297 seats) well short of a majority, he had to deliver on this promise. Heath offered him a coalition, including a seat in the Cabinet, plus a Speaker\u2019s Conference on electoral reform; but though Thorpe seems to have been attracted to the idea, Liberal candidates and activists deluged party headquarters with objections. Not only would a Conservative\u2013Liberal coalition have lacked a majority of seats (and so required support from at least one other party, probably the Ulster Unionists), but most Liberals believed the party\u2019s success was largely the result of Heath\u2019s unpopularity. The fourteen Liberal MPs thus rejected Heath\u2019s offer and called instead for an all-party Government of National Unity to carry out an agreed short-term economic programme. Since neither of the main parties was interested in repeating the events of 1931, Heath resigned and allowed Wilson to form a minority administration.[CITATION-102] A new election was widely expected within months, and the most optimistic Liberals hoped that \u2018one more heave\u2019 would bring the party to power, though the Labour government\u2019s honeymoon period made this task much harder. By ending the miners\u2019 dispute, repealing the Industrial Relations Act, and taking action on rents and food prices, Wilson sought to signal a return to pragmatic social-democratic governance, and an Opinion Research Centre poll in April found that six out of ten voters\u2014including a majority of Liberals\u2014felt that Labour had been \u2018much more moderate and constructive than they expected\u2019.[CITATION-103] The Liberal Party was also divided in its analysis of the February result, since some activists believed that Thorpe had overdone the case for \u2018moderation\u2019 and should have offered a more \u2018assertive presentation of Liberal policies\u2019.[CITATION-104] By contrast, Thorpe was more impressed by the strong public support for co-operation, and worried that Heath would succeed in blaming the Liberals for putting Labour in office. In June, Thorpe and his chief whip David Steel went on television to declare that they were still willing to form a Government of National Unity (GNU) if the next election proved inconclusive.[CITATION-105] Polls carried out during the summer of 1974 found wide support for the principle of such a government; as Heath\u2019s Shadow Cabinet noted in July, the country was \u2018currently going through one of its coalition moods\u2019.[CITATION-106] Even the most cursory examination of the idea, however, revealed two serious problems. Firstly, a succession of Conservative MPs\u2014mostly moderates such as Maurice Macmillan and Ian Gilmour\u2014publicly expressed an interest in a coalition, whereas Labour ministers vigorously rejected it.[CITATION-107] The Liberals pointed out that Heath\u2019s confrontational record in office meant that he could hardly pose as a unifying figure, but that implied that they might be willing to serve under a different Tory leader.[CITATION-108] Secondly, as Jo Grimond pointed out, any coalition would need a clear \u2018goal\u2019, since the country would \u2018not be pulled out of its decline simply by cobbling together a Cabinet of different parties\u2019.[CITATION-109] The obvious rationale for co-operation was to deal with the economic crisis created by the oil shock, which by mid-1974 had produced rapid inflation and a large balance-of-payments deficit.[CITATION-110] Thorpe thus used a speech at Loughborough in July to set out a \u2018minimum programme required to save this country from economic disaster\u2019, involving prices and incomes controls, electoral reform, industrial co-partnership, and cuts in \u2018prestige projects\u2019 in order to redirect resources to social security.[CITATION-111] Yet thoughwas impressed by the \u2018Left-wing flavour\u2019 of his speech, many of the Liberals\u2019 most attractive social policies had already been pre-empted by the minority Labour government.[CITATION-112] To many on the left, a GNU seemed to be little more than a vehicle to manoeuvre Labour out of office, re-impose wage restraint, and smuggle in proportional representation by the back door.Suspicions that the Liberals were tacking to the centre right were reinforced by a hardening of the party\u2019s economic stance after the February election. John Pardoe, for instance, warned in lurid terms that Britain was \u2018approaching that situation of \u201cexplosive inflation\u201d which has been experienced in so many South American countries\u2019, which would be \u2018a danger to our society, to our politics, to our Parliamentary Institutions, to our very democracy\u2019. Though he rejected monetarism on the grounds that mass unemployment was unacceptable, he argued that \u2018the menace of inflation must be met; met hard; and met now\u2019, and accused the Labour Chancellor, Denis Healey, of attempting to evade the problem.[CITATION-113] Faced with an interventionist Labour government and corporate alarm about a \u2018profits squeeze\u2019, some Liberal MPs also began to worry about the survival of the market economy. Pardoe declared that Labour\u2019s attempt to hold down prices through controls and subsidies was \u2018nuts\u2019, while Wainwright warned that \u2018Export-led growth cannot be achieved by State-shackled manufacturing industry\u2019.[CITATION-114] Even Thorpe claimed that Britain had become \u2018a nation living beyond its means, with a standard of living which cannot be sustained by our current level of economic activity\u2019. Sooner or later, the Liberal leader insisted, the government would have to be honest with the electorate about the need for sacrifice.[CITATION-115] This gloomy analysis of Britain\u2019s economic position meant that the Liberal message in the October 1974 campaign sat rather awkwardly with the glitzy style which Thorpe had chosen. The party had calculated that a vote share of 26\u201328 per cent would deliver a much larger block of MPs, and Thorpe hoped that his tour of target seats\u2014first by hovercraft and then by helicopter\u2014would help attract the media coverage required for a national breakthrough.[CITATION-116] In addition to television news coverage, the Liberals gained sympathetic treatment from much of the press, which discussed the party\u2019s manifesto \u2018with unprecedented seriousness\u2019 and covered Thorpe\u2019s speeches at length.[CITATION-117] Alastair Hetherington ofechoed the Liberal argument that \u2018consensus\u2019 could be \u2018tough, progressive, and fair\u2019, whileendorsed a GNU and,, and thesupported a Conservative\u2013Liberal coalition with varying degrees of clarity.[CITATION-118] By Liberal standards, the campaign was also well resourced, though the party was still poorer than its rivals. Across the two elections of 1974, Conservative Central Office spent over \u00a31.6 million and Transport House just under \u00a31 million, while even the inclusion of Thorpe\u2019s direct aid accounts only took central Liberal spending to about \u00a3300,000.[CITATION-119] At constituency level, the gap was smaller: Liberal candidates\u2019 election expenses averaged \u00a3725 in October, compared with \u00a31,275 for Conservatives and \u00a31,163 for Labour candidates.[CITATION-120] Alongside the national campaign, the Liberals concentrated their efforts on about forty \u2018critical marginals\u2019, drawing on the work of the Winnable Seats Committee, which Thorpe had established in the 1960s, and the experience which agents such as John Spiller had gained in the 1972\u20133 by-elections.[CITATION-121] Almost all of these seats were Conservative-held, so squeezing residual Labour support became a particular focus.[CITATION-122] As both Labour and the Conservatives sought to burnish their moderate credentials, however, Liberal poll ratings struggled to break through the 20 per cent mark. In the final week of the campaign, Thorpe focused his argument back on political reform in an attempt to \u2018sharpen and simplify\u2019 the party\u2019s message:Shall we persevere with the mistakes of a quarter of a century for another five years on October 10, or shall we have the courage to BREAK THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM\u2014AND SAVE BRITAIN[?][CITATION-123] Peter Riddell of thethought Thorpe was \u2018more surefooted\u2019 after this pivot, but there was no Liberal surge, and attempts to attract tactical anti-Tory votes bore little fruit.[CITATION-124] Overall, the Liberal vote share fell back slightly, and the party dropped to thirteen seats, losing Hazel Grove and Bodmin while gaining Truro. The BES survey found an enormous \u2018churn\u2019 in Liberal support, as the party lost almost half its February voters but gained about two million others.[CITATION-125] The party\u2019s post-election inquests revealed a range of views. David Steel argued that the Liberal message had been \u2018too intellectual and too complicated\u2019 and that the party needed to strengthen its appeal to \u2018erstwhile Labour voters\u2019, but some activists felt that Thorpe and Steel\u2019s musings about coalition had alienated precisely this group.[CITATION-126] Some members of the national executive thought the emphasis on \u2018the gravity of the country\u2019s economic situation\u2019 had been overdone, to the detriment of \u2018other matters of equally vital concern to the people\u2019. Others complained that \u2018the image of frivolity surrounding the Leader \u2026 contrasted with the serious nature of the campaign\u2019, and that the party had \u2018failed to promote\u2019 the \u2018grass roots campaigning image\u2019 implied by the community politics strategy.[CITATION-127] R.W. Johnson has characterised the period between 1974 and 1976 as the era of the UK\u2019s \u2018Great Fear\u2019, in which \u2018parts of the establishment began seriously to consider alternatives to our present form of parliamentary democracy\u2019.[CITATION-128] Rapid inflation\u2014peaking around 25 per cent in 1975\u2014and the perceived humiliation of the 1976 IMF crisis led to widespread talk of national decline and social breakdown, reinforced by a wider cultural mood which made the 1970s \u2018the golden age of paranoia\u2019.[CITATION-129] At the most extreme end of the spectrum, figures such as the retired general Sir Walter Walker and the Cold War strategist Brian Crozier were rumoured to be flirting with the possibility of a military coup, and New Left commentators such as Stuart Hall warned that middle-class complaints about inflation, taxation and crime would provide fertile territory for \u2018authoritarian populism\u2019.[CITATION-130] Yet talk of realignment and constitutional change also drew on more liberal and progressive sources, including the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign in the June 1975 referendum, which brought Heath, Jenkins and Thorpe together to argue in favour of continued EEC membership. As Robert Saunders has pointed out, \u2018the spirit of cross-party solidarity embodied by Britain in Europe was widely applauded\u2019 in the press, and the referendum result was seen as a decisive victory for \u2018moderates\u2019 over the Labour left and the Powellite right.[CITATION-131] , for instance, followed up the referendum by calling for a centrist coalition which could give effect to the shared goals of the \u2018middle majority\u2019.[CITATION-132] The shift from election season to the normal routines of parliamentary life made it hard for the Liberals to maintain the high public profile they had gained in 1974. Although the Labour government\u2019s slim majority of three seats gave smaller parties some leverage, the Liberals found themselves jostling with the eleven Scottish National Party MPs, three Plaid Cymru MPs, and assorted Northern Irish politicians for influence and media coverage.[CITATION-133] Margaret Thatcher\u2019s election as Conservative leader helped to restore Tory morale, and Thorpe\u2019s position was under fire even before Norman Scott\u2019s allegations broke into the public domain in January 1976.[CITATION-134] By the time Thorpe resigned as leader in May 1976, the Liberals had fallen back to 10 per cent in the polls and were starting to experience heavy losses in local elections.Despite these setbacks, some of the themes which the Liberals had launched into public debate in 1973\u20134 continued to resonate. In particular, the case for electoral reform had begun to take on a life of its own before the October 1974 election, when the Oxford political scientist S.E. Finer used an article into articulate a \u2018defence of deadlock\u2019.[CITATION-135] Finer argued that the \u2018conventional wisdom\u2019 that the first-past-the-post system delivered \u2018firm and stable government\u2019 was no longer tenable, since neither Wilson nor Heath had managed to tame the unions, and the combination of economic crises (in 1967 and 1972) and electoral swings (in 1970 and 1974) had produced a succession of sharp policy reversals.[CITATION-136] Under a PR system, with coalition or minority governments, \u2018social and economic policy would be more continuous, more incremental and more self-consistent\u2019, and it would be \u2018all but impossible for one powerful sectional interest to bully or to capture parliament\u2019.[CITATION-137] Finer recruited sympathetic colleagues such as Nevil Johnson and the economists Thomas Wilson and David Stout to help flesh out this argument in a book of essays on(1975), and the \u2018adversary politics thesis\u2019 became a staple of UK political science literature during the late 1970s and 1980s.[CITATION-138] The Hansard Society sponsored a Commission on Electoral Reform chaired by the Conservative historian Lord Blake, which came out in favour of a switch to either the Additional Member System or the Single Transferable Vote.[CITATION-139] Lord Harlech, the chairman of the European Movement and a former British ambassador to Washington, also launched a National Committee for Electoral Reform (NCER) in June 1976 to co-ordinate a public campaign on the issue.[CITATION-140] The adversary politics thesis was strongly influenced by the apparent success of the West German political system in maintaining policy stability and public consent for anti-inflationary measures during the mid-1970s. As the NCER\u2019s director Richard Holme put it, West Germany was \u2018a democracy which works\u2019.[CITATION-141] This vision of a consensus democracy was particularly attractive to many of the technocrats who had struggled to make corporatism work in Britain over the previous decade; for instance, the director general of the National Economic Development Office, Ronald McIntosh, voted Liberal in the two 1974 elections and publicly urged politicians to break free from \u2018adversary politics\u2019.[CITATION-142] At the same time, PR also appealed to businessmen who feared the rise of a left-wing Labour government and complained that policy instability was undermining their investment plans. For instance, a meeting of British United Industrialists in June 1975 found \u2018considerable agreement that the present electoral system \u2026 is very bad for private enterprise which needs to make long-term plans and cannot know whether such plans might be viable under whatever Government may be in power\u2019.[CITATION-143] Thorpe canvassed business support for PR during 1974 and 1975, and drew a sympathetic response from figures such as Sir Val Duncan of Rio Tinto Zinc and Sir Marcus Sieff of Marks & Spencer.[CITATION-144] This interest in constitutional reform overlapped somewhat uneasily with right-wing machinations against the Labour government. Indeed, Duncan reportedly convened a dinner for business leaders in May 1975 at which he talked about how the army would \u2018play its proper role\u2019 if the UK descended into anarchy.[CITATION-145] Thorpe hoped that corporate donors would either defect to the Liberals or use their influence to swing the Conservatives round to electoral reform, but in the end, neither happened. Though Heathite MPs such as Douglas Hurd and Sir George Young were sympathetic, Margaret Thatcher was deeply hostile to both PR and the broader coalitionist impulse.[CITATION-146] As her biographer Charles Moore has noted, \u2018\u201cNational unity\u201d annoyed Mrs. Thatcher very much\u2019, because she \u2018instinctively preferred the public two-party battle to a world of private understandings and shifting alliances\u2019 and \u2018believed that the answer to the national crisis was not the forging of a national consensus round the old, wrong policies, but a bold leap for new, right ones\u2019.[CITATION-147] The Conservatives\u2019 rejection of consensus politics reflected Thatcher\u2019s commitment to monetarism and the wider free-market agenda, which (as Jim Bulpitt pointed out in his classic analysis of Tory \u2018statecraft\u2019) offered an alternative means of reasserting the authority of the state.[CITATION-148] At the same time, this strategic decision was also shaped by a particular view of the \u2018Liberal vote\u2019. The October 1974 Tory campaign had been premised on the belief that voters who had abandoned Heath for Thorpe favoured \u2018moderation\u2019, but Thatcher and her allies were more impressed by the heterogeneity of Liberal support. Nigel Lawson, for instance, insisted that the assumption that \u2018the Liberal vote is a liberal vote\u2019 was a \u2018complete misconception\u2019. Rather, Thorpe had attracted an anti-establishment \u2018protest vote\u2019 which had already largely disintegrated by the late 1970s.[CITATION-149] The belief that \u2018a special ploy to get the \u2026 Liberal vote\u2019 was unnecessary meant that the Conservatives tackled the Liberals \u2018in a very low key\u2019 during the 1979 campaign.[CITATION-150] Even so, Thatcher did develop a distinctive approach to dealing with the party. As Saunders has pointed out, the sharp rhetorical contrast which Thatcher drew between Conservative \u2018freedom\u2019 and Labour\u2019s \u2018socialism\u2019 had the effect of \u2018squeezing the space for the Liberals\u2019 and reinforcing the bipolar tendencies of the existing electoral system.[CITATION-151] Like Winston Churchill in the 1940s, Thatcher tapped in to an essentially liberal political language and positioned the Tories as the defenders of traditional Liberal values such as free enterprise, self-help and personal responsibility.[CITATION-152] Thatcher\u2019s efforts to polarise debate on these lines were aided by growing frustration with tax, regulation and trade union power among large sections of the middle class. For Thatcher and her sympathisers, such as Ronald Butt in, the Liberals had become \u2018a by-stander in the essential political battle\u2019 over the role of the state in British society.[CITATION-153] The long-standing Tory claim that \u2018a vote for the Liberals is a vote for Labour\u2019 was strengthened by David Steel\u2019s decision to prop up the Callaghan government through the 1977\u20138 Lib\u2013Lab Pact.[CITATION-154] The Pact is perhaps best understood as a reflection of Steel\u2019s belief that the Liberals needed to gain credibility as a potential governing partner if \u2018realignment\u2019 was ever to happen.[CITATION-155] At the same time, the Pact also marked an important shift in the party\u2019s public discourse. During 1974\u20135, Thorpe and Pardoe had framed Britain\u2019s economic and political malaise as an existential crisis which could be only be overcome through immediate and radical change; under Steel, the party\u2019s tone became more orthodox and incremental. Steel threw his weight behind the Callaghan government\u2019s economic strategy, including the spending cuts which Denis Healey had agreed with the IMF, and sought to take credit for the recovery that followed. Through the Pact, the Liberals argued, \u2018doctrinaire Socialism\u2019 had been curbed, inflation had fallen from 18 per cent to less than 10 per cent, and the UK had experienced \u2018a remarkable recovery of financial confidence\u2019.[CITATION-156] Yet the actual policy concessions which Steel obtained were slim, and mainly involved tax changes (such as incentives for profit-sharing). As Michael Steed warned in a 1978 strategy paper, Steel\u2019s emphasis on moderation was \u2018a negative appeal, unlikely to build up committed support\u2019, even if it fitted \u2018logically and naturally with a balance of power strategy\u2019.[CITATION-157] Jo Grimond posed the issue more starkly to the journalist Hugo Young: \u2018What is happening, in all this, to the Liberals as the party that wants to bust the system?\u2019[CITATION-158] When the 1979 election came, Steel fought an effective and well-organised campaign, and fears of a full-scale collapse did not materialise.[CITATION-159] Nevertheless, the Liberals\u2019 fall from 18.3 per cent to 13.8 per cent of the vote made a significant contribution to Thatcher\u2019s victory. Between October 1974 and 1979, the Conservative vote rose by 3.2 million. BES data suggest that this involved a net gain of about a million votes from the Liberals and about 750,000 votes from Labour, with the rest coming from differential turnout and the minor parties.[CITATION-160] The BES found that most of the Thorpe-to-Thatcher switchers were former Conservative voters who were returning to the fold, but some were new converts.[CITATION-161] Thatcher not only won back middle-class voters (and especially women) who had flirted with the Liberals earlier in the decade, but also made inroads into traditional Liberal heartlands.[CITATION-162] In particular, the Conservatives defeated Thorpe in North Devon and Pardoe in North Cornwall, and won the rural Welsh seat of Montgomery for the first time since 1874. The fact that Thorpe was about to stand trial on charges of conspiracy to murder a former gay lover hardly helped the Liberal cause.[CITATION-163] By contrast, Thatcher\u2019s brand of Conservatism, rooted in her provincial Methodist background, resonated with many small-business people and Nonconformist voters. As in 1970, the Liberals found it difficult to insulate themselves from a middle-class backlash against Labour\u2019s economic record or to deflect the Tories\u2019 appeal to cultural conservatism.Set in this broader context, it is clear that the Liberal revival is of profound importance for our understanding of political change in 1970s Britain. The events of 1972\u20134 established the Liberals as a major political force across rural and suburban England for the first time since the Second World War, building on the foundations which had been laid in the Orpington period. Thorpe and his colleagues articulated a resonant critique of class politics and warned that Conservative and Labour governments were leading the nation into crisis; as such, they were agents as well as beneficiaries of dealignment. At a cultural level, the Liberals gave expression both to young voters\u2019 frustration with the starchiness and materialism of post-war politics and to a more conservative (and in many ways antithetical) impulse towards \u2018national unity\u2019. The very ambiguity of Liberal policy contributed to this broad appeal. In particular, the demand for electoral reform and the belief in \u2018community politics\u2019 allowed the Liberals to adopt the rhetoric of \u2018anti-system\u2019 populism while remaining firmly committed to pluralist parliamentary democracy.[CITATION-164] By framing \u2018adversary politics\u2019 as a hangover from the industrial conflicts of the early twentieth century, the Liberals also tapped in to a growing sense that class-based identities were becoming anachronistic. Voting Liberal was a simple way for people to assert their political agency, even (or perhaps especially) if it was a one-off act rather than a lasting conversion.The political scientist Peter Hall has characterised the mid- and late 1970s as a period of deep political choice in Britain, in which the crisis of confidence in Keynesian economic management opened up the \u2018marketplace for economic ideas\u2019 and paved the way for a \u2018paradigm shift\u2019 towards monetarism and neo-liberalism.[CITATION-165] In this marketplace, the Liberals offered a distinctive proposition, albeit one based mainly on constitutional rather than economic radicalism. Indeed, the Liberals\u2019 response to inflation and industrial conflict was strongly coloured by the technocratic, productivist and nationalist assumptions which permeated Britain\u2019s post-war settlement.[CITATION-166] Yet though the prospect of a renewed consensus was an attractive one, the Liberals\u2019 strategy for shoring up Keynesian welfare capitalism was not without its limitations. In particular, Pardoe\u2019s economic policy relied heavily on the belief that a package of redistribution, workers\u2019 participation, and constitutional reform could make statutory wage controls effective and politically sustainable.[CITATION-167] This was always an optimistic notion, and became more so over time as the mid-1970s recession and the IMF loan reduced the scope for \u2018flanking\u2019 wage restraint with progressive social policies. Nor was the party well prepared to confront the hard choices which coalition would require. For instance, most Liberal voters in 1974 saw the party as closer to the Conservatives than to Labour, whereas Liberal activists leaned to the left and (as the row over Heath\u2019s coalition offer showed) were generally hostile to working with the Tories.[CITATION-168] The broad but shallow nature of the Liberal breakthrough can also be seen as a reflection of Thorpe\u2019s leadership style. As Peter Bessell noted, the February 1974 campaign was \u2018a personal triumph for Jeremy\u2019:In an age dominated by TV personalities, he succeeded in conveying to the viewers the policies of his party in simple terms while projecting a personal image of statesmanship fortified by idealism.[CITATION-169] Heath\u2019s lack of charisma and charm created a political opening which Thorpe energetically filled. At his best, he helped the Liberals tap into an iconoclastic mood while remaining a \u2018safe\u2019 option for erstwhile Tory voters. Yet Thorpe\u2019s focus on publicity rather than ideas also came at a political cost, and by the time of the October election there were signs that his appeal was already waning.[CITATION-170] His reputation as \u2018a preening dandy who adored the limelight\u2019 tended to undermine the credibility of Liberal policies and to obscure the more creative currents of activism at the Liberal grass roots.[CITATION-171] This made it easy for critics to portray the party as a narrowly electoral machine, characterised by \u2018rootless opportunism and occasional poujaedism\u2019 (as the Labour MP Phillip Whitehead put it in 1981), rather than a principled political movement.[CITATION-172] Even so, the legacies of 1974 lived on, most obviously in the SDP/Liberal Alliance. Roy Jenkins\u2019s landmark 1979 Dimbleby Lecture drew heavily on the critique of \u2018adversary politics\u2019 that had emerged earlier in the decade; if the voice was unmistakeably Jenkins\u2019s own, most of the words could have been written by John Pardoe or S.E. Finer. The Gang of Four gave the Alliance the gravitas which Thorpe had lacked, though Jenkins\u2019s lacklustre performance in the 1983 campaign suggested that this was a dubious asset. Thatcher\u2019s confident leadership and renewed popularity after the Falklands War also made it hard to present constitutional reform as an urgent response to a looming crisis. The SDP\u2019s focus groups in the run-up to the 1983 election found that the language of stability and national unity still resonated, but this was \u2018not interpreted as meaning a need for centrist policies\u2019 so much as allowing Thatcher to \u2018finish the job\u2019 she had embarked on.[CITATION-173] As the Alliance struggled to \u2018break the mould\u2019, 1974 passed into Liberal mythology as a reminder of what the party had achieved on its own and how little progress had been made. \u2018What were all the doubts, humiliations, climb-downs, sell-outs and surrenders to Dr Owen \u2026 for\u2019, a dispirited contributor tomagazine asked after the 1987 election, \u2018when we have gained a total haul of seats and votes not greatly in excess of that won by a scratch Liberal campaign 13 years ago?\u2019[CITATION-174] Only when the Conservative vote collapsed in 1997 did the Liberal Democrats manage to convert the electoral potential which Thorpe had revealed into significant parliamentary gains. Only when Nick Clegg took the party into government in 2010 did it become clear that the bond between its leaders and its voters was just as fragile as it had been in the 1970s.[CITATION-175] "

    "text": "In October 1939, the British Government lifted a formal \u2018colour bar\u2019 to military service for the duration of hostilities. Yet despite the state\u2019s rhetoric of a multi-racial, multi-ethnic \u2018People\u2019s War\u2019, racial discrimination continued to pervade Britain\u2019s wartime armed forces. In particular, the Royal Navy (RN) fiercely resisted opening up naval service to eligible British men of colour. Providing a fresh critical perspective on wartime Admiralty records, this article establishes that the Second World War catalysed a significant shift from a codifiedstructure of racial exclusion in the Navy, to a more informal system that was rooted in a complex and diffuse web ofracist recruiting practices. It demonstrates the ways in which, between the temporary removal of the formal \u2018colour bar\u2019 to naval service in 1939 and its permanent abolition in 1947, the RN enacted a series of complicated covert mechanisms that were designed to shut out men of colour by stealth as far as possible. The article also scrutinises a number of letters of protest that were written to the Admiralty on behalf of Black West Indian, Maltese and Anglo-Indian individuals who were denied entry to the Service. These letter-writers collectively sought to expose the Navy\u2019s hidden racial discrimination and to challenge, with varying degrees of individual success, the naval institution\u2019s continued practices of racial exclusion. Overall, this article ascertains how complex and contested meanings of \u2018race\u2019, national \u2018belonging\u2019 and \u2018Britishness\u2019 were invested in the Royal Navy during the Second World War.His Majesty\u2019s Government have decided that any Colonial British subjects and British protected persons in this country, who are not of pure European descent, are to be on the same footing as British subjects of pure European descent as regards voluntary enlistment in the armed forces and as regards eligibility to be considered for the grant of emergency commissions in those forces.[CITATION-1] On 19 October 1939, the British government lifted an official \u2018colour bar\u2019 to enlistment and commission in His Majesty\u2019s armed forces for the duration of hostilities. Multiple factors fed into this decision, including military manpower requirements; maintaining control in British colonies; and bolstering Britain\u2019s image as a self-proclaimed liberal democracy and moral antithesis of Nazi Germany\u2019s programme of racial superiority. In practice, however, as Wendy Webster has explained, during the Second World War the image of imperial unity and common cause portrayed through government propaganda and media messaging of a \u2018people\u2019s empire\u2019 was mostly a chimera. Notwithstanding the Colonial Office\u2019s endeavours to market convincingly the concept of a racially unified wartime \u2018imperial community of allies\u2019 across the metropole and the colonies, Webster has shown that a range of wartime ministerial departments in Britain continued to pursue racist policies through increasingly covert private discussions and documents rather than more visible formal state policies.[CITATION-2] Despite the October 1939 proclamation, Britain\u2019s wartime armed forces remained tainted by entrenched systemic racial discrimination, and Tony Kushner and Gavin Schaffer have discussed at length how the Air Ministry and War Office continued to exhibit and implement racial discrimination in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Army throughout the Second World War.[CITATION-3] The Royal Navy (RN), however, displayed a distinctive and peculiarly hostile approach towards the recruitment and commission of \u2018non-white\u2019 Britons which demands closer socio-cultural analysis than it has so far received.Questions remain as to why the Navy embraced such acute resistance to opening up naval service to otherwise eligible British men of colour, and whether the Second World War wrought any significant and long-lasting change to the nature and practices of systemic naval racism in Britain. Uncovering how racism was institutionally hidden, performed and embedded within the Navy during the nation\u2019s \u2018finest\u2019 hours, this article adopts two key areas of focus. First, it investigates how senior naval commanders and politicians in the Admiralty (the government office in charge of naval affairs) made a concerted effort to circumvent the lifting of the state\u2019s restrictions on entry to the RN while maintaining a public stance that naval service remained open to all. It shows how, between the temporary removal of the formal colour bar to military service in 1939 and its permanent abolition eight years later, the RN enacted a series of complicated covert mechanisms that were designed to shut out men of colour by stealth as far as possible. Following this line of enquiry, the article interrogates the Second World War as a turning point for a significant shift from a codifiedstructure of racial exclusion in pre-war naval regulations to a more informal system that was rooted in a complex and diffuse web ofracist practices in recruiting policy. Many of these forms of racism had certainly been in circulation throughout the Navy\u2019s pre-war history, but this article contends that the Second World War period drove the administrative operationalisation of naval racism more deeply under cover and ratified furtive, oblique performances of racial discrimination into key pillars of naval recruiting policy in the 1940s. This article therefore considers the Second World War as a catalyst in the RN\u2019s institutional transformation of concrete official racial barriers into the clandestine endorsement of subterranean pathways of prejudice, many of which lingered into the later twentieth century. Secondly, the Navy\u2019s enduring biases did not go unchallenged in wartime British society, attracting considerable anger from the families and communities of men who were rejected for naval service on the grounds of racial heritage. Some of these people, including colonial subjects of Black African descent in the British Caribbean and people of Black African, Indian and Maltese heritage living in Britain, wrote to the Admiralty to protest against the continued performance of racial oppression in the wartime RN. Through examining this correspondence, this article endeavours to understand more about what impact institutional discourses and practices of racial exclusion exerted on the identities, lives and emotions of men and women of colour who wished to join Britain\u2019s armed forces between 1939 and 1945. The following research highlights how complex and contested meanings of race and national identity were invested in Britain\u2019s Second World War Navy and how wartime individual, community and institutional selfhoods were fashioned in connection to the service. Ultimately this study extends and complicates a broader picture of what British naval service meant to different groups of Britons during the Second World War.Training fresh sights on wartime Admiralty records held in the National Archives, this article analyses intersecting constructions of \u2018race\u2019, naval identity and national \u2018belonging\u2019 in internal and external naval correspondence, memos, regulations and responses to proposed policy changes. These documents also reveal the Admiralty\u2019s attempts to reinstate official policies of racial exclusion from British naval service in the two years immediately following the war. Consequently, this article extends its focus into the mid- to late 1940s in order to establish how far significant changes and continuities in the Admiralty\u2019s wartime discursive and institutional practices of racial discrimination set the scene for a new chapter in the naval politics of race in post-war Britain. A great debt is owed here to Marika Sherwood, who brought attention to the relevant Admiralty files in the 1980s and has written multiple works that outline the broad contours of institutional racism among naval top brass during the Second World War.[CITATION-4] Building on Sherwood\u2019s foundations, this article proffers a closer, more granular reading of contemporary ideas about \u2018race\u2019 and \u2018Britishness\u2019 in the wartime archive and develops a recent scholarly focus on the remaking of racial paradigms within colonial contexts across the world between 1939 and 1945.[CITATION-5] The Second World War marked a major point of inflection in the transformation of global empires and economies based on racialised social and political order. The demands of total war forced imperial regimes to create new strategies and optics of confronting racial discrimination in order to manage racialised populations and recruit colonial subjects to meet military manpower requirements. For many militaries the war thus represented an extraordinary global moment of racial integration amid the race-based hierarchies of an imperial world. Takashi Fujitani\u2019s study of the United States\u2019 recruitment of Nisei Japanese and Japanese recruitment of Koreans during the Second World War underlines, for instance, that the exigencies of fighting a total war compelled the modification of previously formalised racial hierarchies and prejudices in both military institutions and the national communities they served. Within both the US and Japanese wartime militaries, a \u2018complex recalibration\u2019 of attitudes towards different ethnic groups occurred, a process that Fujitani identifies as an important transition from \u2018vulgar\u2019 overt discrimination to a \u2018polite\u2019 racism which appeared less violent and more inclusionary.[CITATION-6] As this article establishes, similar mutations of \u2018acceptable\u2019 official racism were embedded in wartime British naval recruiting practices and attitudes, institutionalising surreptitious forms of racial discrimination that profoundly shaped the Navy\u2019s post-war peacetime profile.Generally speaking, well-publicised shifts in official approaches to harnessing the military manpower of racialised subjects did very little to erase entrenched racial hierarchies, which military officers in different armies across the globe were frequently determined to maintain so far as possible. As historians of Britain\u2019s wartime colonial forces have pointed out, despite the British government liberally coating colonial military recruitment and advancement in a glossy veneer of multicultural inclusivity and equality of opportunity, widespread racial prejudices continued to inform how those military hierarchies operated in practice. David Killingray, Tarak Barkawi and Daniel Owen Spence have illustrated that colonial military leaderships engaged in a variety of gambits to avoid white servicemen having to serve alongside, or be commanded by, indigenous personnel.[CITATION-7] Britain\u2019s Royal Navy was thus only one of many military organisations that waged an imperial war in the context of official assurances of multi-racial solidarity while stealthily maintaining informal colour bars. Nevertheless, with one or two exceptions, the RN remains unaccountably confined to the footnotes of the wider scholarship.[CITATION-8] By putting forward new understandings of the distinctive reasoning, mechanisms and tactics by which Britain\u2019s Navy sought to remain a chiefly \u2018whites only\u2019 institution in a conflict that was popularly billed as levelling and unifying British society, this article pushes forward the developing field of \u2018new naval history\u2019, using \u2018the prism of naval affairs\u2019 to examine wider themes of imperialism, nationhood, society and culture.[CITATION-9] In so doing, it also critically advances a recently and rapidly growing scholarship that emphasises the contribution of British subjects from the British Isles, colonies and Commonwealth countries to the nation\u2019s armed services between 1939 and 1945. This literature challenges an effective whitewashing of historical portrayals and popular memories of the \u2018People\u2019s War\u2019.[CITATION-10] In thus helping to reorient wider historical analysis of the Second World War as a multi-racial, multi-ethnic enterprise, this article offers an intervention in the history of racial and ethnic presence, diversity and belonging in Britain\u2019s mid-twentieth century armed services.Sections I and III explore how the Admiralty\u2019s militant opposition to both temporary and permanent removal of a colour bar to Britain\u2019s armed services created a long-lasting collective of insidious mechanisms of policing the racial boundaries to naval service. Section I identifies the production of a range of backdoor practices during the early war years to limit the numbers of men of colour who were able to enlist for naval service. These included the use of weaponised racial humour; the deployment of racialised gradations of \u2018Blackness\u2019 and \u2018whiteness\u2019; and a tacit reliance on ingrained racial prejudice among naval recruiting authorities and officers recommending candidates for commissions. In addition, there were articulations of pseudo-concern for the emotional well-being of the sailor of colour, who was identified as an automatic target of racial abuse on the lower deck. Section III considers how, between 1944 and 1947, in an effort to reinstate formalised racially prohibitive pre-1939 naval recruiting regulations, the Admiralty yoked together emerging geopolitical anxieties about Britain\u2019s deteriorating colonial power, fears of damage to the Service\u2019s reputation and fighting efficiency, and racialised assumptions about the psychological and command capabilities of commissioned officers of colour.These sections on Admiralty structures and practices bracket a discussion of more individual perspectives on wartime naval racism. In her pioneering work on archives and race in Britain, Caroline Bressey emphasises the importance of historical researchers finding new \u2018pathways\u2019 to trace the presence, identity and stories of people whose ethnicity was not necessarily included in the archives on which historians conventionally rely.[CITATION-11] Section II thus approaches the wartime Navy\u2019s informal colour bar from a fresh angle, opening up different ways of reading the presence of Britons of colour in the official naval archive and recovering the reactions and emotions of those who were excluded from joining the Service. Statistical evidence recording the number of British sailors from the Indian subcontinent and African diaspora in the wartime RN is notoriously elusive, not least because even the Navy itself claimed not to know the precise figures. Some records appear to have been disposed of altogether.[CITATION-12] This archival silencing in the official wartime naval records reflects a longer-term late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century disaggregation of men of colour from the service and history of the Navy, conveying a misleading impression that British-born and colonial subjects of colour had little stake in Britain\u2019s Second World War naval project. In fact, as Section II establishes, this was far from the case. During the research process, five forceful letters were unearthed from these files, written to the Admiralty on behalf of Black West Indian, Maltese and Anglo-Indian men who were denied entry to the service. Frustratingly, since these letters advocated on behalf of others, we cannot, and do not, hear the voice of the seafaring subaltern himself speaking from the Admiralty records. Nevertheless, this correspondence stands testament to the desire of many British men of Asian and African heritage to enlist for naval service. These letters of protest and entreaty are therefore analysed, not just as evidence of the continued performance of racially discriminatory practices at British naval recruiting offices during the war years, but also as a means of accessing hitherto neglected responses and challenges to naval racism from the rejected sailor\u2019s family and friends. These epistolatory challenges to discriminatory naval recruitment practices are read here individually and collectively as meaningful acts of racial and gendered agency, opposition to naval race-based discrimination, and assertions of selfhood that complicate understandings of race relations and Britain\u2019s wartime armed services.Throughout this article, the term \u2018race\u2019 is approached as an unstable social construct and discursive category. This, as Laura Tabili suggests, enables the analysis of an \u2018opportunistic flexibility\u2019 with which various historical actors created and employed racial categorisation.[CITATION-13] Tracking key pillars in the Admiralty\u2019s racially discriminatory perceptions of the sailor of colour from 1939 to 1947 highlights the ways in which a distinctive nautical investment in early twentieth-century \u2018race science\u2019 underpinned official naval reluctance to admit men of \u2018non-European descent\u2019 into the Service. Throughout the British Army, RAF, and RN during the war, there was considerable cross-fertilisation of ideas drawn from a pseudo-racially scientific discourse which shaped the broad enactment of exclusionary principles against \u2018a wide range of minorities and nationalities deemed to be insufficiently white\u2019.[CITATION-14] However, the wartime Navy presents a unique and instructive case-study of the creation and implementation of new social technologies of racial control and strategies of managing servicemen of colour within Britain\u2019s mid-twentieth-century armed forces. Wartime RN recruiting regulations may have been broadly aligned with the mechanisms of \u2018racially scientific\u2019 discrimination that the other services operated, but naval officials fashioned their own constructions of race within the maritime world, creating and performing specific stealthy strategies to oppose widespread racial inclusivity in the Senior Service. Discourses belonging to an imperial \u2018seafaring race theory\u2019 played a key role in shaping wartime naval recruitment strategies, and Spence has shown how Britain\u2019s recruitment and management of male personnel for colonial navies drew heavily on pseudo-scientific preconceptions of racial suitability for naval service.[CITATION-15] Some wartime recruitment of men from colonial coastal and river communities into Britain\u2019s Navy did occur, but the inclusion of \u2018non-Europeans\u2019 for naval service continued to be considered as desirable only under highly restricted and localised circumstances. Men of colour from the metropole were given very little encouragement to enlist at all. In the wartime process of establishing a revised set of racial border controls at the gateway to the RN community, the Admiralty regularly pleaded that the Navy represented a unique case and deserved special privileges to operate racially exclusionary policies in terms of enlistment and commissions. Their tactics consistently demonstrated the performance of Tabili\u2019s \u2018opportunistic flexibility\u2019 in the racial categorisation of who was granted access to Britain\u2019s naval community. As this article explores, the British wartime naval gaze allocated men of colour to specific, highly limited roles within the economy of naval labour in a warship and firmly consigned the sailor of colour to a place on a geographical and cultural \u2018imperial periphery\u2019.It is argued here that the wartime Navy serves as a prism through which to examine different discourses surrounding national belonging in relation to race and military service in mid-twentieth-century Britain. The language in which \u2018race\u2019 and \u2018belonging\u2019 were connected and articulated was manipulated in many different ways. Under the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act (1914), the common status of British subject applied to any person born within \u2018His Majesty\u2019s dominions and allegiance\u2019. This status left considerable room for different groups and actors to interpret and claim Britishness and national belonging along a flexible range of political, cultural, geographical and racial lines. Like many of their contemporaries, various members of the Admiralty employed \u2018British\u2019 as a synonym for \u2018English\u2019, which was invariably equated with whiteness. The labels \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018coloured\u2019 were also used inconsistently and interchangeably in the wartime Admiralty files. In the period under discussion here, many people living in Britain tended to use the term \u2018coloured\u2019 to refer to anyone who was not considered to be \u2018pure\u2019 white European, including persons of Black African, West Indian, Asian, Maltese and mixed-race descent. Furthermore, the term \u2018native\u2019 was used to label persons identified as indigenous to colonial lands (even when this was inaccurate) and was often used commensurately with \u2018coloured\u2019 as a code for communicating an implicit cultural status of \u2018non-Britishness\u2019. Within this \u2018larger racialized discourse of disenfranchisement\u2019 and framework of racial differentiation, Britons of colour continued to live largely outside the symbolic and linguistic boundaries of the white imagination in the metropole during the Second World War.[CITATION-16] In examining the wider fashioning of a distinctly white official naval selfhood in these Admiralty files, this article advances a literature that examines historical processes of remaking the modern sailor in the Royal Navy as racially white. It builds on the scholarship of Mary Conley and Isaac Land, who identify the increasing conflation of concepts of male \u2018Britishness\u2019 and \u2018whiteness\u2019 with an imagined national right to serve and belong in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Navy, confirming that these ideas also critically shaped naval recruiting and commissioning policy in the 1940s.[CITATION-17] To some extent, the Admiralty\u2019s attitudes towards creating a racially desirable community of white sailors during the war were not particularly new. A lengthy historical process of creating an increasingly \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for men of colour in the British navy while simultaneously promoting the RN as a literal and metaphorical figurehead of white British manhood, national identity and imperial power dates back to at least the early nineteenth century.[CITATION-18] Notwithstanding a short interregnum in which colour lines were temporarily blurred to meet the exigencies of the First World War, in this sense the 1939\u201345 conflict represents only a more recent chapter in a longer story of refashioning ideas of the British seaman as racially white in the modern RN.[CITATION-19] However, the fundamental change that the Second World War chapter of this story brought about was the British state\u2019s formal (if decidedly flimsy) prohibition of racial discrimination in the armed services. Rather than softening Admiralty views towards racial inclusivity, what Kennetta Hammond Perry conceptualises as the \u2018mystique\u2019 of the state\u2019s anti-racist policy had the effect of both disguising and crystallising Admiralty determination to covertly institutionalise racial exclusion in the wartime and post-war Navy.[CITATION-20] Against ideas of the racially desirable white British sailor, the emergence of the \u2018coloured\u2019 seaman as a source of social, cultural, economic and political anxiety in the early twentieth century maritime workforce also fed into the Admiralty\u2019s construction of the sailor of African or Asian descent as a problem figure in the Second World War Navy. On the whole, despite the \u2018seafaring race theory\u2019 that created gradations in the Admiralty\u2019s beliefs in the usefulness of some racial groups to the Navy\u2019s war effort, Admiralty discussions between 1939 and 1947 primarily articulated discourses of the \u2018non-European\u2019 sailor as inherently undesirable in general naval service. Official objections to regularising the inclusion of \u2018coloured\u2019 sailors in warships were, as Schaffer observes and as this article fleshes out, mostly rooted more in practical than ideological concerns.[CITATION-21] In specific ways, however, the practical and the ideological collide and entwine in the Admiralty archive. Racial discrimination in the wartime Navy must be read against a wider milieu in which the labour demands of the inter-war shipping industry had shifted and redefined ideas of racial difference in Britain.[CITATION-22] Inter-war assumptions that increasingly associated any seaman who possessed black or brown skin with a legal and cultural status as \u2018alien\u2019, and as the source of unfair competition with white men for jobs, implicitly informed and underpinned the wartime Admiralty\u2019s discussions surrounding the inclusion of sailors of colour on an equal footing in the elite national community of the RN. The net effect of hostile inter-war government legislation such as the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act (1919) and the Coloured Alien Seamen Order (1925) was to knot together more tightly racialised and \u2018alien\u2019 identities. This served to define Black and minority ethnic seamen in Britain collectively as \u2018presumptive aliens\u2019 and to create a loose second-tier form of British national belonging which was detached from white \u2018Englishness\u2019.[CITATION-23] Nevertheless, the trope of an imperial \u2018family\u2019 of British subjects pulling together in common endeavour was heavily tied into Britain\u2019s martial efforts in two world wars, and was not easy for the Admiralty during the Second World War to discard.[CITATION-24] With its privileged status as a British national emblem of global pride and power, the twentieth-century Royal Navy was also closely tied into an imperial \u2018family\u2019 concept and had been deployed to propagate a binding sense of belonging and Britishness across the Empire since the late nineteenth century. Pre-1939 recruiting regulations made quite clear, however, that this sense of being \u2018family\u2019 stopped short of men of \u2018non-European descent\u2019 being allowed to join the Service on the same terms as white men. Thus framed by complex, tangled concepts which painted sailors of colour as both \u2018alien seamen\u2019 and \u2018imperial family\u2019 in wartime Britain, this article approaches these terms as two ambiguous and negotiated points on a shared continuum of discourse. This discourse critically shaped constructions of \u2018race\u2019, ethnicity and national \u2018belonging\u2019 in the Admiralty\u2019s debates over who should be included in the wartime RN, and by implication in the wider national and imperial community that the institution served and symbolised.On 30 September 1939, a senior naval officer announced that \u2018there is no need for us to take coloured men residing in England who may show a preference for the R.N.\u2019.[CITATION-25] When war broke out, it had been the Navy\u2019s intention under the Military Training Bill (May 1939) and National Service (Armed Forces) Act (September 1939) to reject any man of colour in Britain who stated a preference to join the navy. As a result of government pressure, however, by early October, the Admiralty had been forced to revise its position, deeming it \u2018politically expedient\u2019 to follow the Air Ministry and War Office in lifting the official colour bar as an emergency measure for the duration of hostilities.[CITATION-26] Anxious about the risk of agitation across Britain\u2019s colonies, Malcolm MacDonald, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and the Marquess of Zetland, the Secretary of State for India, applied pressure on the armed forces to remove racial barriers to Britain\u2019s military services temporarily. Responding to a specific enquiry about the inclusion of men of Indian heritage in the RN, on 14 October, the Admiralty grudgingly announced a change of direction:There must be no discrimination on grounds of race or colour. In practice much inconvenience would arise if this theoretical equality had many examples. Each case must be judged on its merits, from the point of view of smooth administration. I cannot see any objection to Indians serving on H.M. Ships where they are qualified and needed, or if their virtues so deserve rising to be Admirals of the Fleet. But not too many of them, please.[CITATION-27] The rather mendacious dualism exhibited here set the tone for the ensuing years of Admiralty discussions surrounding racial inclusivity in the Navy. Indicative use of the phrase \u2018theoretical equality\u2019 established a clear sense of intended naval resistance towards the proposed relaxation of rules on race and place in the Navy. This document also embodies Tabili\u2019s \u2018opportunistic flexibility\u2019, switching back and forth between public acceptance of racially inclusive recruitment regulations and private imposition of conditions on and limitations to the service of men of colour. This two-faced attitude firmly underpinned the range of backdoor codes and strategies that the wartime Admiralty devised to deploy against candidates of colour.Wartime Britain housed unprecedented numbers of new arrivals who formed a multi-national, multi-ethnic imperial community of allies, and the trope of a \u2018family\u2019 of Britons uniting across the colonial world to fight fascism was broadcast throughout the metropole and the colonies.[CITATION-28] The Admiralty, however, did not subscribe to discourses that encouraged colonial peoples to identify themselves as \u2018British\u2019 and to consider themselves \u2018at home\u2019 in Britain, and vehemently opposed any suggestion of encouraging colonial men of colour to travel to Britain to join the Navy. Instead, the Admiralty preferred to expand existing colonial navies or create new ones, such as the Trinidad Naval Volunteer Force, inaugurated in October 1939, in order to prevent a racial open door recruitment policy:If the coloured races in our Colonial Empire wish to volunteer \u2026 the proper course seems to be for the colony concerned to raise an entirely coloured force, that is with coloured Officers commanding their own men, speaking their own language who they understand.[CITATION-29] The prejudiced belief that men of colour from the colonies were psychologically, culturally and linguistically unfit for service alongside white British seamen was further articulated in Admiralty discussions which advised that, with the exception of \u2018those limited spheres of employment where native races are specially suitable\u2019, the Navy should continue to \u2018set its face against\u2019 any widening of entrance to the service.[CITATION-30] Specific colonial coastal societies or localised riverine communities, such as the Kru people of West Africa or Muslim sailors from the Swahili coast known as \u2018Seedies\u2019, had long been deemed by the British to possess qualities that made them inherently superior to other non-seafaring populations for limited naval service. For several centuries, traditions of fishing and maritime trade among the Kru and the \u2018Seedies\u2019 had been harnessed by the British imperial power to legitimise its authority and to promote global naval superiority.[CITATION-31] Throughout the war, the RN continued this long tradition of accepting men of \u2018non-European\u2019 descent for limited, local service in places such as the Mediterranean, the West Indies, East Asia and Africa. A distinctive, racially linked index of shipboard roles frequently operated, in which seamen of Black African, Maltese, Chinese and Indian heritage were traditionally allocated domestic roles such as stewards and cooks, or occupations which kept them below decks as stokers. Separate messing and sleeping arrangements were usually made for ratings of colour on local colonial stations.Official naval opinion thus deemed that the \u2018rightful\u2019 place of colonial naval recruits of colour was to serve limited engagements on selected stations within their own \u2018natural\u2019 environment. In this way, the body of the colonial seaman of colour could be kept static, literally, figuratively and collectively restricted from accessing positions of power, and his employment would offer no threat to the labour of white British sailors. In addition to this clear adherence to separate spheres of naval service as delineated by racial and environmental borders, there was a distinct hierarchy of naval service in Britain\u2019s wartime naval forces. In subscribing to \u2018seafaring race theory\u2019, the Admiralty perceived that the so-called \u2018native races\u2019 were biologically unsuited to general naval service and lacked \u2018the qualities which are required in a Naval rating\u2019.[CITATION-32] This stance was partially connected to long-running assumptions that climate determined biological suitability for localised naval service. From the eighteenth century, Enlightenment arguments that northern Europeans possessed superior morals and intelligence because of the temperate climate in which they lived were used to justify British colonial rule over peoples who inhabited hot or humid climates, which purportedly sapped morality and incited uncontrollable passions.[CITATION-33] These ideas of \u2018racial suitability\u2019 for naval service resonated throughout official recruitment policies for the RN. As Spence notes, it was believed that a \u2018lack of imagination\u2019 rendered men of colour innately more \u2018suitable for monotonous work\u2019.[CITATION-34] The Admiralty\u2019s preferred colonial naval strategy was thus to allocate more mundane tasks such as anti-submarine patrols, harbour defence, minesweeping and local convoy escort duty to the colonial naval reserves, leaving the RN free to sweep out to engage the enemy in battle on the high seas.Gradations of \u2018colour\u2019 were also fashioned in opposition to the supposed virtues of \u2018pure\u2019 white European heritage as a mechanism for filtering out racially undesirable groups of sailors from joining the elite naval community of the RN. \u2018Seafaring race theory\u2019 heavily conditioned the Admiralty\u2019s views of what one senior naval officer described as \u2018the borderline races\u2019, a category of people whom he deemed unsatisfactory for naval service, in which he included \u2018near-whites\u2019 such as men of Turkish, Armenian, Syrian and Maltese descent.[CITATION-35] With regard to the latter, the Admiralty had long denigrated the suitability of the Maltese for naval service. Maltese requests to join the inter-war RN had been firmly restricted to non-continuous (short) Service engagements and local deployments in the Mediterranean on the grounds of:the unfitness of the Maltese for responsibility \u2026 their dislike for service away from the Mediterranean and the family problems which would arise if they served on any other station; their ignorance of English; and, above all, their poor fighting qualities, which had been repeatedly emphasised, and had led to the opinion that the Maltese would be a weak spot in any ship.[CITATION-36] This attitude continued to shape Admiralty responses towards hopeful applicants of Maltese origin throughout the war. Maltese sailors were racially categorised at the point of intersection where gradations of \u2018Blackness\u2019 and white \u2018Europeanness\u2019 met. As Simon Jenkins observes, 1930s and 1940s racialised constructions of the Maltese highlight the ways in which men from the Mediterranean area were bequeathed an \u2018in-between\u2019 racial status which was not fully white British, but nor were they entirely aligned with those of Black African descent.[CITATION-37] Jenkins suggests that this \u2018in-between\u2019 status reflected both Malta\u2019s geographic and linguistic middle ground between Europe and North Africa, while perceptions of racial difference between Maltese and white British seamen were heightened by a hierarchical political economy of labour on naval ships in which, like most West African and West Indian sailors, Maltese ratings tended to be employed as stokers, stewards or cooks. Again, this conflation of racial groups and roles aboard ship produced and reinforced racialised hierarchies of naval service. From the perspective of enlistment and commissioning into the wartime Navy, the Maltese were expediently construed as racially more aligned with North Africa than with Europe, thus providing a means of restricting the longevity, nature and geography of these seamen\u2019s service.Although the presence of African sailors in the RN can be traced back for several centuries, the Second World War confirmed the modern British naval gaze as decidedly white.[CITATION-38] The late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century \u2018cult of the navy\u2019 in British imperial culture fundamentally reconfigured the relationship between navy and society, tethering together national and imperial identities to shape a distinctive sense of Britishness that was symbolised by the Royal Navy.[CITATION-39] As protector and promoter of Empire, the pre-1914 Fleet became a potent national icon of imperial strength and naval men came to be represented as \u2018defenders not only of British interests abroad but also of Britishness\u2019 itself.[CITATION-40] In so doing, it squeezed sailors of colour out of the wider cultural narrative. Despite the Navy\u2019s appalling losses at Jutland in 1916, and drastic inter-war cutbacks to the service, elements of this naval \u2018cult\u2019 continued to shape social and cultural images of the prestige of naval men throughout the Second World War. Patriotic Britishness was frequently linked to the nation\u2019s long-standing relationship with, and mastery of, the maritime environment. Conley highlights the creation of a distinctive \u2018model of naval manhood\u2019 that \u2018served to inculcate British patriotism by constructing a shared British heritage based on freedom, whiteness and admiralty of the seas\u2019.[CITATION-41] Increasingly, this \u2018cult of the navy\u2019 aligned itself with what Bill Schwarz describes as \u2018racial whiteness\u2019.[CITATION-42] Since white skin was viewed as \u2018the norm\u2019 in Britain and thus provided a means of defining \u2018Britons\u2019 against racialised \u2018Others\u2019, Schwarz notes that modes of transmission of whiteness rarely needed to be made explicit.[CITATION-43] These Admiralty files contain only the most fleeting overt references to their preference for white recruits; rather, articulations of desirable \u2018racial whiteness\u2019 are found in the substitution of the word \u2018British\u2019 for \u2018white\u2019 and the racialisation of belonging in the nation\u2019s navy. One discussion about the rules for entering naval ratings for permanent service ascertained that the entry of \u2018Maltese or men of Colour\u2019 for other than local service must be \u2018subject to special Admiralty sanction\u2019. \u2018In practice\u2019, the statement continued, \u2018the cases that come up are usually those of half-breeds, and the decision depends mainly on the \u201cBritishness\u201d of the man\u2019s appearance and habits\u2019.[CITATION-44] Acceptance for long-term or career service in the Navy thus depended upon the individual\u2019s countenance and performance of racial whiteness under the guise of \u2018British\u2019 qualities perceived in his physical appearance, speech and behaviours during his interview with naval recruiting authorities. The Admiralty used constructions of identity, largely based around ideas of white Europeanness, to create a racially bordered pool of recruits for the service. This \u2018racial community\u2019 of acceptable naval recruits remained more or less sealed by a colour bar on the grounds that \u2018the wider the nationality door is thrown open\u2019, the greater the \u2018competition\u2019 to enter the Navy and \u2018many Englishmen will perforce have to be rejected for naval service\u2019.[CITATION-45] This speaks to the powerful legacy of inter-war anti-alien discourses that were bonded to skin colour and viewed the Black or brown sailor as poaching in the preserves of white Britons. As an extension of a racially white elite national community, the wartime Admiralty regarded naval service as the rightful privilege of the white British male.The Admiralty\u2019s desire to maintain, as far as possible, a racially white community of seamen below decks is again articulated in a further flimsy justification for excluding recruits of colour. Admiralty discussions in October 1939 referred to \u2018the well-known difficulties we have in associating coloured men with British ratings on the Lower Decks of His Majesty\u2019s ships\u2019.[CITATION-46] No mention was made, however, of precise evidence or salient details of the \u2018difficulties\u2019 which are referred to here. Instead, these discussions were glossed over in general tropes of physical and cultural difference and assimilation which drew directly upon older imperial constructions of a so-called \u2018science of race\u2019 that synthesised phrenology, eugenics and crude \u2018social Darwinism\u2019. Contemplating the \u2018problem\u2019 of including men of colour as naval recruits, subsequent internal consultations remarked that \u2018a rating who is not as the other men on board are is liable to be uncomfortable and a source of discomfort to the rest of the ship\u2019s company\u2019.[CITATION-47] Claiming a shared official knowledge that non-white ratings posed a risk to morale and discipline, thereby endangering the fighting efficiency of a ship, enabled the Admiralty to demand a special privilege to exercise practices of racial discrimination:Conditions in the Navy are very different to those in the other Services; men have to live under much closer and intimate conditions; a man can choose his friends but he cannot get away from those who wish to be unfriendly \u2026[CITATION-48] A distinctive brand of naval racism based on the intimacy of the shipboard environment and the necessity of maintaining a \u2018happy ship\u2019 in order to maximise fighting efficiency thus emerges from these files. Pseudo-paternalistic concern for the individual man of colour attempting to \u2018fit in\u2019 with a white ship\u2019s company offered a key mechanism for maintaining racial barriers to wartime naval service. Conjecture that the lower decks would not accept a rating of colour was propagated as received wisdom by naval authorities. Objections were raised to the inclusion of men of colour for naval service \u2018principally because they would not mix with the lower deck generally\u2019.[CITATION-49] Doubts were also expressed about how the meaning \u2018of pure European descent\u2019 might be applied to recruitment procedures: \u2018The Admiralty view has been that it should be interpreted as excluding persons whom the Lower Deck would be likely to class as \u201cn****rs\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-50] Such conscious marketing of racism as the natural preserve of the lower deck, rather than that of the officer class and \u2018top brass\u2019, offered senior naval officials a means of refusing \u2018coloured\u2019 sailors while proclaiming institutional commitment to racial equality and fair play.Assertions of racialised humour below decks offered a further strategy for denying Britons of colour the opportunity to serve in the Navy. Frequently expressed official \u2018concerns\u2019 for the welfare of the sailor of colour insisted that he would be an automatic butt of racist jokes from his white comrades. Proclamations that \u2018a coloured man might suffer from the gibes of those who still object to the coloured persons being received \u201cinto our midst\u201d\u2019[CITATION-51] and \u2018Any pronounced native feature would be a constant source of amusement which would be unfair to the man\u2019 were common in the official naval archive.[CITATION-52] This presumption that the lower deck would immediately make the sailor of colour a target of malicious amusement on the grounds of physical difference not only inadvertently reveals a sense of class prejudice against the predominantly working-class lower deck, but also exposes another articulation of racial whiteness in the form of perceived working-class naval humour. In 1943, the Director of the Admiralty\u2019s Press Division commented that if a recruit did not possess a \u2018predominantly European\u2019 appearance, he would be \u2018likely to attract attention and comment from their shipmates, which however good humoured, is likely to cause distress and resentment if the person concerned is at all sensitive\u2019.[CITATION-53] There are echoes here of the twenty-first century concept of \u2018banter\u2019, in which teasing is regarded as \u2018a means of performing masculinity, male bonding and creating boundaries to inform in-group acceptance and out-group rejection\u2019.[CITATION-54] By the early twentieth century, the bawdy \u2018Jolly Jack Tar\u2019 persona of the naval rating had been reworked into something more domesticated, decent, kindly and cheerful.[CITATION-55] Desirable naval masculinity was fundamentally rooted in \u2018good humour\u2019 but these Admiralty documents suggest that the \u2018good humour\u2019 of the naval rating was enclosed by racialised boundaries. For \u2018banter\u2019 to be successful, there is an imperative to meet a \u2018humour requirement\u2019.[CITATION-56] In manipulating an assumption that the racialised recipient of such banter would not accept the situation in the requisite spirit of \u2018humorous and comradely\u2019 tolerance, the Admiralty\u2019s preconception of the non-white sailor\u2019s response structure to teasing threw the onus of responsibility for maintaining harmonious working relations below deck onto him.[CITATION-57] This wartime form of \u2018victim blaming\u2019 thus set up a binary in which the white Tar was full of genial humour and bonhomie whereas the sailor of colour was positioned as primitive and volatile, and \u2018flunked every test of masculine respectability\u2019, including the ability to take a joke.[CITATION-58] Under the guise of concern for the emotional welfare of the rating of colour, racialised humour was weaponised by naval \u2018top brass\u2019 as a tool to shut him out of the Navy.Tacit reliance on ingrained racial prejudice among naval recruiting authorities and officers recommending candidates for commissions offered a further means of preventing large numbers of men of colour from either entering or progressing in the Navy. While the Admiralty may have been grudgingly forced to comply with the government\u2019s October 1939 lifting of racial barriers to the armed services, it nevertheless took advantage of multiple workings of institutionalised discrimination to quietly shut anybody considered not sufficiently white out of the Navy as far as possible. Theoretically, from October 1939, the colour bar on temporary commissions had been lifted for the duration of the emergency, yet the Admiralty remained quite adamant that they did not want \u2018non-Europeans\u2019 in command of white ratings. Should the war continue for long enough, it was accepted that some \u2018Hostilities Only\u2019 ratings would have to be commissioned in order to meet manpower requirements. However, there were still mechanisms by which the upper deck could continue to remain white. Candidates from the lower deck who wished to apply for a commission required the approval of their commanding officer; \u2018it is most unlikely\u2019, reflected one member of the Admiralty, \u2018that Commanding Officers will recommend for commissions any of the coloured ratings\u2019.[CITATION-59] The Admiralty maintained its two-faced approach towards racial inclusivity in the wartime RN through reliance on an implicit shared set of racist structural attitudes on the upper deck and in its recruiting offices to keep prospective officers and ratings of colour out of the Navy. At the beginning of the war, a view was expressed that \u2018hard and fast\u2019 collective regulations were required to deal with the issue of recruitment of men of colour for naval service. This view was rationalised on the grounds that it would be \u2018an unfair responsibility to place upon recruiters generally, to ask them to exercise discretion between a native whose intelligence might be such as to enable him to overcome the natural disadvantages of his race and a native without such qualities\u2019.[CITATION-60] Publicly, however, the Admiralty maintained the position that each applicant would be treated on his individual merits, and a few weeks later, the Director of Naval Recruiting was informed that \u2018it would seem desirable to notify to recruiting authorities the change in policy involved in the above decision so that they shall not refuse entry out-right to men who are barred from entry by the present regulations against men of colour\u2019.[CITATION-61] In the event, this deliberately left naval recruiting authorities considerable scope to exercise their own judgement as to what the \u2018merits\u2019 of the individual applicant actually were. Some recruiting officers were clearly open to supporting the applications of men of colour. Others were distinctly less so.Residues of the emotional impact of this informal colour bar can be found in the disparate surviving handful of letters that were written to the naval authorities on behalf of Britons of colour (including British Isles-born and colonial subjects) whose hopes of serving in the wartime RN had been dashed. Pulling together this fragmented range of \u2018ephemeral archival presences\u2019 to read more closely along the naval \u2018archival grain\u2019 enables the location, albeit at second hand, of some sense of the rejected candidates\u2019 experiences and feelings\u2014and those of their families and communities\u2014at being denied entry to the Navy on the grounds of ethnicity.[CITATION-62] While writing from within a vast global spectrum of different experiences and responses to British colonial rule, collectively these letter-writers tend to emphasise a shared belief in the service as an institutional branch of Britain\u2019s \u2018imperial family\u2019, both among British subjects living in the colonies and in the British Isles (though whether this expressed belief was genuinely held or more strategically leveraged is impossible to discern). Although penned from very different social, cultural, political, economic, colonial, familial and ethno-racial backgrounds, and from very different physical and emotional proximities to hegemonic white British national identity, these letters are read collectively here as anti-racist acts of protest against naval discrimination. They offer a fleeting glimpse into the subjectivities of the author, proffering deeply intimate expressions of selfhood that contrast with what Ann Stoler calls \u2018the sober formulaics of officialese\u2019 in the archive, and complicating understandings of race relations and Britain\u2019s armed forces during the Second World War.[CITATION-63] Arguably, the content and existence of these letters in the administrative records, providing living evidence of racial discrimination in the Navy, somewhat destabilise the official naval archive and its accompanying narrative of racial whiteness as the ultimate signifier of \u2018Britishness\u2019 and national belonging.An early voice of anger and disappointment at the wartime Navy\u2019s practices of racial exclusion pours out of a letter written in February 1940, penned by a Mrs J. Lepine from Surrey to the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain. In her letter, Lepine sought to enquire into the Navy\u2019s recruitment policies for Anglo-Indians on behalf of her son, whom she was sure had been rejected for enlistment because of his racial heritage. Expressing considerable frustration that her previous communication to Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, had been \u2018ignored\u2019, Lepine challenged Chamberlain that she was \u2018anxious to know if you also are prejudiced against Anglo-Indians being accepted in the Navy\u2019.[CITATION-64] The letter clearly registers the lady\u2019s dismay and censure that her son had been refused entry for naval service on what she perceived to be a basis of racial prejudice: \u2018It puzzles me why the Navy should take this attitude\u2019. As we shall see, like other letter-writers, Lepine used her correspondence to launch a blistering broadside in protest against racist naval recruitment policies, contending that it was \u2018unfair and senseless to condemn any race from sheer prejudice\u2019 and making an appeal for equitable treatment, remonstrating that \u2018This doesn\u2019t go to prove British justice\u2019.Echoing this letter\u2019s appeal to an imagined, idealised sense of \u2018British justice\u2019, a similar challenge was also launched in a letter received by the Admiralty in January 1943. On this occasion, the letter-writer was an unnamed white English mother of a young man aged between 14 and 15. Despite being \u2018very keen\u2019 to join the Navy, the youngster suffered the disappointment of being turned away from a recruiting centre in Bristol because his father was a Black West Indian.[CITATION-65] Due to his age, the young man had hoped to enter for naval training as a boy seaman and thus to embark on a professional career in the service. Unfortunately, this route of entry came under the category of \u2018Continuous Service\u2019, for which the Admiralty had specifically refused to relax its regulations governing recruits of colour. Much of this letter communicated the boy\u2019s mother\u2019s outrage at the racist attitudes she and her son had encountered at the recruiting office. In particular, she reported that \u2018I was told that my son would probably not be acceptable because he has black hair and eyes, and an olive complexion. \u201cIf only he was lighter-skinned\u201d was one remark\u2019. As the mother of several sons, her letter emphasised the distress that these social and systemic practices of racial discrimination based on shade and tone of skin colour and \u2018un-English appearance\u2019 could cause within a family unit. The letter-writer also communicated a feeling of bitter irony that her son was not deemed suitable to make his career in regular naval service because of his skin colour but in a few years \u2018he would be called up in any case\u2014so he would be considered acceptable to fight, and perhaps die for his country\u2019. Upon contending that since Britain was fighting to preserve the Commonwealth it was downright unjust that her son was ineligible to enter the Navy, the mother claimed to have received the following response from the naval recruiters:technically there is no \u2018colour bar\u2019 for entrance to the navy, but simply \u2026 my boy would not be able to \u2018get on\u2019. He could sit for entrance as an apprentice it appears, but would be up against an intangible social bar: I was told that I should have appreciated this difficulty.[CITATION-66] Once again the Navy denied allegations of outright discrimination. The Bristol recruiting centre seemingly maintained the official line that there was no \u2018colour bar\u2019 to the wartime armed services, although the discussion of the youngster\u2019s lack of \u2018pure European\u2019 appearance somewhat undermines this stance. Again, backdoor strategies of racial exclusion are evident in the recruiter\u2019s deployment of a claim that a \u2018social bar\u2019 that would inhibit his professional prospects and make his life afloat a misery in order to prevent the boy\u2019s entry to the Navy. This provides a clear example of putting naval two-faced paternalism into practice, invoking the pretence of doing the boy a kindness to discourage him from pursuing his application. The letter-writer was clearly dismayed and angry at this rejection, noting that her son had been \u2018decently educated and is fit and keen, but because of racial prejudice would be handicapped from the start\u2019. The timing of this letter is particularly significant, as it was written only a matter of weeks after the publication of the Beveridge Report in November 1942, which offered a blueprint for a new, more equitable post-war society. Echoing some of the contemporary wider discussions that were in circulation about what the post-war reconstruction of British society would look like, the mother introduced both imperial and racial factors into the debate: \u2018Does this attitude give hope of real understanding between the peoples of our Empire\u2014or of justice within these Islands? Should not social reconstruction start now\u2014and not wait upon some problematical future day?\u2019In asserting her son\u2019s rights to join the Navy, this letter-writer articulates a clear belief that the naval institution should be reflective of Britain as a multi-racial democracy in both the wartime present and a peacetime future. The correspondent chose to send her letter to the Admiralty by way of the photojournalistic magazine,, which was known for its liberal editorial views. Harnessing the power of a popular magazine proved an effective method of combating the Admiralty\u2019sracism. When the Editorial Department at the magazine passed the letter on to the Admiralty, asking for their comments on the matter, some consternation was clearly caused in various Admiralty departments. In February, the Director of the Press Division replied towith a strong affirmation that there was \u2018no colour bar as such\u2019 against entry to the Navy but repeating all the familiar cautions that it was not in the individual candidate\u2019s best interests to apply unless they were of \u2018predominantly European\u2019 appearance.[CITATION-67] In a transparent endeavour to prevent unwelcome publicity, the Admiralty askedto inform the boy\u2019s mother that in this particular instance, arrangements could be made for her son to attend an interview at the Charing Cross Road recruiting office in London. However, clearly fearing a rush of hopeful applicants of colour, firm instructions were issued to the magazine that this information was to be shared with the correspondent only and was categorically not to be included for publication and public consumption. Within her epistolatory assertion of power from below, this letter-writer deployed a range of tools to advocate for her son, including the emotive invocation of maternal outrage, familial disruption, appeals to \u2018British justice\u2019, and her own cultural capital as a white British woman. The records do not show whether the youngster was eventually admitted to the Navy, but what this letter does demonstrate is that, when threatened with reputational damage, the Admiralty was not prepared to risk making public its covert racist recruiting strategies. As a corollary to this incident, it is also worth noting that the boy\u2019s mother commented on the fact that one of the original recruiters at the Bristol centre had \u2018told me not to accept his word as final\u2014therebe exceptions\u2019.[CITATION-68] This presents a working example of the levels of discretion invested in recruiting offices to decide individual cases on their \u2018merits\u2019, and the fact that entrance to the Navy for any length of service could be subject entirely to the prejudices of the recruiter on duty on any given day.Challenges to the Admiralty\u2019s attitude that the borders of Britain\u2019s \u2018imperial family\u2019 stopped short of the RN were also launched from the colonial periphery. In her analysis of the responses of West Indian peoples to the outbreak of war, Anne Spry Rush highlights that many experienced a surge of affectionate desire to support Britain as the \u2018mother country\u2019.[CITATION-69] Within the Caribbean region, many people identified\u2014albeit for differing religious, social, political and economic reasons, and in different ways\u2014with an identity as \u2018imperial Britons\u2019. This enabled colonial subjects to conceptualise, negotiate and manipulate a sense of \u2018Britishness\u2019 alongside more localised identities.[CITATION-70] Determined early twentieth-century endeavours to promote the navy throughout the Empire as an agent of imperial strength, unity and \u2018Britishness\u2019 had also sought to distribute the \u2018cult of the navy\u2019 to colonised as well as colonisers, with varying degrees of receptivity.[CITATION-71] One of the letters in the Admiralty files demonstrates how a young Black Bermudan woman invested a complex range of emotions including hope, anger, disappointment and hero-worship in the institution of the RN. On 16 March 1943, a Miss Robinson penned a furious letter to the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound.[CITATION-72] This letter provided a detailed account of an incident earlier that day in which the author\u2019s brother had presented himself at the Royal Naval Dockyard in Bermuda in the hopes of joining up as a Wireless Operator but had been rejected. Upon being called to appear before the secretary to the Commander of the Dockyard, Robinson recorded, her brother was flatly refused entry: \u2018one word \u201ccoloured\u201d kept that boy from joining the British Navy\u2019. According to Robinson, the secretary explained her brother\u2019s rejection on the grounds of \u2018naval orders\u2019, although it is unclear whether these \u2018orders\u2019 pertained to the Admiralty\u2019s instructions to prevent men of colour from travelling to Britain to serve in the Navy, the naval strategy of funnelling men from the colonies into colonial naval forces, or the wider backdoor colour bar which operated through the Navy\u2019s administrative and recruitment practices. In any case, Robinson clearly believed that her brother had been prevented from joining the navy on the grounds of his skin colour alone. Her letter professed to blame localised racism in the island of her birth as the culprit for her brother\u2019s rejection rather than to accept that such institutional racism was being directed all the way from the metropole. Alluding to a local culture steeped in centuries of racial discrimination, she contended that:it is my idea that such orders must have been made in this confoundedly crooked little island\u2014surely they could not have come from London!\u2014It seems to me that I heard that any man regardless of race, colour or creed could join any of H.M. Forces \u2026 I have suffered enough in twenty one years through being born with a \u2018lick of the tar brush\u2019.Bitterness and disbelief that additional racial discrimination to that already suffered by Robinson and her family could be channelled through naval recruitment procedures is poured into this letter. Written only hours after her brother\u2019s rejection from naval service, Robinson\u2019s strength of feeling is communicated through the ferocious dashes which punctuate her letter. This epistle speaks not only of her brother\u2019s humiliation and disappointment, it also testifies to her own pain and feeling of racial rejection at the hands of the Navy:From early girlhood, I have always had the greatest love and admiration for H.M. Navy\u2014and have heatedly defended it on many an occasion \u2026 For nights since the war began I have knitted comforts for British sailors and love and prayers for their safety have gone into every one\u2014is this reward?A fascinating and complicated set of meanings attached by Robinson to the Navy emerges here. Although the RN had long been a chief vehicle of colonial power across the British West Indies, her letter does not articulate explicit connections between the Service and the historical legacies of racial oppression it helped to facilitate in Bermuda. Instead, like the previous letter-writer, she deploys an emotional appeal that lays claims to a wider status of personal \u2018belonging\u2019 in both the naval institution and the British imperial communities it served. Perry\u2019s \u2018mystique of British anti-racism\u2019 is invoked here through the author\u2019s semi-wishful, semi-accusatory construction of \u2018Britain\u2019 as a land of racial tolerance, equality and fair play.[CITATION-73] It is certainly possible that the letter-writer deliberately employed these strategic discourses in the hopes of creating space for her family\u2019s economic opportunity and professional mobility within the naval institution. In any case, this letter was intended to convey the disappointment of a woman who had treasured an idealistic image of the RN, had physically and emotionally invested in the institution as a beacon of personal opportunity, and who now felt that her place in that \u2018imperial family\u2019 which she so valued had been fundamentally threatened. Like many British colonial subjects in the Caribbean region, Robinson seemingly identified with an invented ideal of imperial Britishness that was bound up in impossibly inflated ideas of racial equality and fairness. In addition to the emotional distress that she describes her brother as experiencing, this letter communicates that the Navy\u2019s racist recruitment policies also punctured her own sense of identity, self and status within this imaginary British Empire of decency and paternalistic justice.[CITATION-74] Robinson\u2019s letter ended on a personal plea, assuring Pound that:I have not just written this letter in a fit of bad temper but am merely asking for justice, of which I know the island Home on which you live, is built.\u2014If any of my phrases seem sharp please believe me, I mean no impertinence; but when one receives a blow from something that has been held dear\u2014perhaps you know the feeling.There is a distinct, perhaps calculated, poignancy in her direct emotive appeal, which affirms a sense of inherent trust in the First Sea Lord\u2019s desire and ability to recognise the injustice of her family\u2019s situation. Mary Chamberlain\u2019s interviews with Caribbean women have highlighted kinship as a powerful, dynamic force in constructions of selfhood, a theme which emerges strongly in Robinson\u2019s letter.[CITATION-75] In her fury, she implores and challenges the institution\u2019s hierarchy of command to acknowledge her brother\u2019s mistreatment, but also to recognise the legitimacy of her own anger and sense of personal disappointment in the Navy\u2019s racist attitude.Collectively, these letters exude sadness and dismay at male relatives\u2019 experiences of racism meted out by the wartime Navy, a sense of hurt which also impinged upon the authors\u2019 own lives. Nevertheless, these are not victims\u2019 letters. They are powerful, angry, and rather brave indictments of the Navy\u2019s racist recruitment policies. In disputing the rejection of beloved sons and brothers for naval service on racialised grounds, these \u2018archival fragments\u2019 offer snippets of clear protest against ingrained racial discrimination within the armed services, and within the archive itself. As epistolary challenges posed by women to masculine power structures within the male-dominated naval institution, these letters also operate as an intriguing form of domestic anti-racist activity in wartime. In fighting for racial justice and equality on behalf of loved ones, they constitute both clear acts of maternal and sororal female agency, and assertions of private gendered and racial selfhoods and power. However, these texts are also layered with multiple contradictory dimensions and complexities which simultaneously enrich and complicate analysis. As Sherry Ortner reflects in her classic essay on the \u2018problem of ethnographic refusal\u2019, by uncritically slotting personal narratives like these letters into a monolithic framework of \u2018resistance\u2019 we risk obscuring their subjective \u2018ambivalences and ambiguities\u2019 and social complexities.[CITATION-76] In entreating the Admiralty to permit their sons and brothers to enlist in the Navy, the letter-writers essentially pleaded for their men to be allowed to fight an inter-imperial war, highlighting some challenging ambivalences between the authors\u2019 commitment to anti-racism and stringent expressions of militarist and imperialist identities in these letters. The maternal agency expressed in the Lepine letter also articulates clear class-based prejudice, with the writer contending that her son deserved privileged consideration for enlistment in the Navy due to his family\u2019s high social status:My father was an Inspector of Police for 26 years, he has even officiated as Dewan of an Indian State. His father was a doctor, yet a dustman\u2019s son has a prior right to the Navy than my son.[CITATION-77] Through highlighting these challenging and intersectional subjectivities in British women\u2019s wartime anti-racist protests, these letters thus provide an important reminder of Ortner\u2019s warning of the need to introduce \u2018complexity, ambiguity, and contradiction into our view of the subject\u2019.[CITATION-78] Nevertheless, despite their many-layered dimensions and subjective ambivalences, these epistles help us to locate previously hidden voices of women of colour, and white mothers who bore sons of colour in inter-racial relationships, claiming and mediating their own identities and stories alongside those of the male relatives on whose behalf they speak.Two other letters that engaged the Admiralty in battle were written by non-familial representatives of the wider communities of men of colour who wished to serve in the wartime Navy. In June 1940, A.V. Agius, Trade Commissioner for Malta, passed along to the Admiralty, via the Colonial Office, a request he had received regarding the hopes of Maltese seamen living in Cardiff to undertake naval service. He included a letter penned by Michael Camilleri, who kept a boarding house in Cardiff and looked after the best interests of Maltese seamen in the local community. Camilleri had written to ask for Agius\u2019s assistance in making enquiry of the Admiralty whether these men might be able to join British naval defence efforts in the Mediterranean. \u2018The Maltese of Cardiff\u2019, explained Camilleri, were keen to offer their services as \u2018The air-raids on Malta have encouraged the Maltese Seamen to do all they can to help the British Empire to keep the Union Jack flying over our Island\u2019.[CITATION-79] Agius added his own postscript, noting meaningfully that \u2018a large number of Maltese have already offered their services for H.M. Minesweepers, but it has not yet been possible to absorb all of them\u2019.[CITATION-80] Pointedly emphasising the contribution of Maltese sailors to the recent heroic feats of the Navy at Dunkirk, he reported that approximately ten Maltese naval ratings had seen action in the minesweeper HMS. The Maltese sailors\u2019 request to play their rightful part in the naval defence of a home that they understood as both nationally Maltese and imperially British contains clear echoes of the Bermudan letter\u2019s sentiments. Inevitably, though, the Navy\u2019s reply indicated that the Maltese seamen\u2019s contention that they were a valued part of a wider imperial family was not shared by naval command. On 4 July 1940, the Admiralty responded with the familiar bland official statement regarding the eligibility of all British sons of British parentage to apply to join the service for the duration. The Admiralty files, however, contain a rather more revealing \u2018fragment\u2019, an abrasive note that was clearly intended for internal purposes which states that the \u2018proper sphere\u2019 of the Maltese seamen was in the Merchant Navy and they would be \u2018rendering the best service by remaining there\u2019.[CITATION-81] This again testifies to the longevity and performance of prejudices about the Maltese sailor\u2019s perceived lack of racial fitness for naval discipline, and underscores ways in which Maltese access to the RN was restricted during the war.Finally, active national Black African and Indian political organisations also exerted a powerful influence on the government\u2019s undertaking to remove racial discrimination in the wartime military. The League of Coloured Peoples (LCP), a Black civil rights group established in Britain by Dr Harold Moody in 1931, fought particularly hard to change pre-war rules governing race and enlistment in the British armed services. In 1939 the LCP joined forces with the International African Service Bureau (IASB) and the West African Students\u2019 Union (WASU) to lobby the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and his counterpart in the India Office, to dismantle racially prohibitive military restrictions. Throughout the war, Moody and the LCP frequently challenged the Services\u2019 continuing racist recruitment practices, lobbying MPs and taking up the cases of individuals who had experienced racism.[CITATION-82] The final letter analysed here illuminates the solid determination of members of Britain\u2019s Black community to secure the lasting removal of the colour bar to military service after the war. A letter dated April 1941, written by Moody in his capacity as leader of the LCP, constituted one of numerous epistolatory challenges launched by the organisation against Service recruitment policies. This letter is particularly significant as it communicates the LCP\u2019s deep concern about the re-imposition of a colour bar once hostilities had ended and desire to build a more racially equitable post-war military in Britain.[CITATION-83] Warning that \u2018already measures have been taken to ensure a status quo ante after the war\u2019, Moody reported that one LCP member who was currently serving with the forces had recently received \u2018a printed notice about re-enlistment in the Services after the war, in which it specifically states that applicants must be of pure European parentage\u2019. The Director of Naval Recruiting denied any knowledge of the existence of such a notice but the challenge to the post-war profile of the Navy was not so easy to quieten.[CITATION-84] Although the Admiralty managed to shelve the question of race and post-war enlistment for a couple more years by claiming that it was impossible to make such decisions while the war was still raging, by 1944 this challenge could no longer be ignored.From 1944, the Army, Navy and RAF began to consider what Britain\u2019s post-war armed forces would look like. All three armed services demonstrated a \u2018grim determination\u2019 to return to a pre-war status quo of racially exclusionary policy.[CITATION-85] Under the guise of recognising the wartime loyalty, bravery, ability and sacrifice of West Indian aircrew, the Air Ministry led the way in openly pushing for a lifting of the colour bar to peacetime service while quietly pulling the door to enlistment shut a little tighter through more informal means.[CITATION-86] The Admiralty fought particularly hard to roll recruitment regulations back to September 1939, and between 1944 and 1947 numerous discussions about the racial makeup of the post-war Navy demonstrated the service\u2019s commitment to ensuring that the naval community afloat remained racially white. Although opposition to racial integration in the army and air force was also voiced, the Admiralty once again contended that the Navy possessed a special legitimacy for maintaining racially exclusionary regulations, on the grounds that unique practical \u2018difficulties\u2019 must be taken into consideration. In this way, arguments that were used to communicate the undesirability of allowing \u2018coloured\u2019 volunteers to enlist as ratings or receive commissions as officers during the war also found expression in discussions that sought to mould the post-war service along racially white lines. Indeed, in July 1946, the Admiralty informed the Cabinet that reasons for \u2018maintaining pre-war practice apply with even greater force to the Royal Navy\u2019:Officers and ratings spend much of their time in ships where living conditions are often uncomfortable and very restricted. For men thus brought together in confined living spaces there is an undeniable reaction against the presence of other races \u2026 Life afloat entails a sacrifice of privacy and the acceptance of an intimacy which have no counterpart in shore life. It would be far more difficult successfully to absorb coloured officers and men into H.M. Ships than it would be to absorb them into a land based Service.[CITATION-87] The Admiralty also retained clear beliefs in a pseudo-scientific racial hierarchy, at the top of which the white European sailor remained with his perceived innately superior skills and abilities. As the post-war era dawned, the Admiralty\u2019s enduring attitude that white sailors were economically and martially preferable to the \u2018coloured\u2019 sailor for regular naval service invoked older anxieties that a highly skilled class of African and Indian sailors might deprive white British men of privileged employment and status in the Navy. Admiralty suspicion that fewer resources would be allocated to the peacetime Navy thus became an additional plea for reintroducing legal codes of racial prohibition. In September 1945 it was contended that lack of funding would make it difficult to maintain the size of post-war Navy that the Admiralty argued was necessary to secure the national interest. The rationale for renewed formal codification of racial exclusion was thus based in a claim that it was \u2018essential that every man recruited is of the highest possible calibre capable of being used in any ship or establishment to which he may be sent and rising to whatever level in Naval service his qualities may permit\u2019. Dire warnings predicted that \u2018it would not be in the interests of efficiency to accept men of colour\u2019.[CITATION-88] As in the army and air force, the key focus of debates about the post-war composition of the Navy concentrated largely on the question of granting peacetime commissions. In 1944 the Secretaries of State for India and the Colonies increased pressure on the services to remove permanently the stipulation that regular commissions could only be granted to officers of \u2018pure\u2019 European descent. Warnings that the colour bar to commissions in the armed forces represented a clear threat to the future of the British imperial project deepened. The Navy, however, remained stubbornly resistant to pressure from the Colonial and India Offices, expressing a trenchant view in November 1944 that British colonial policy of non-discrimination against men of colour was \u2018more suited to Utopia than to the world as it is to-day\u2019.[CITATION-89] Until 1947, when forced to accept at least theprinciple of racial equality in commissioning officers, the RN renewed its assertion that \u2018white lower deck personnel are averse to serving under coloured officers\u2019.[CITATION-90] Discourses claiming that \u2018coloured\u2019 officers were unsuited to command white ratings had underpinned naval recruitment policies since long before the war, but they attained a new level of vehemence as discussions about the post-war Navy gathered pace. In 1944, an internal minute stated that:to expect a United Kingdom rating to take orders from a coloured man holding either Petty Officer rank or commissioned rank is putting a strain on discipline which in these days of relative slacker discipline is undesirable.[CITATION-91] Extending this line of argument, in 1946 the Admiralty expressed concerns that the inclusion of \u2018coloured\u2019 officers in ships would adversely impact on deployment abroad:The Royal Navy is more liable than the other two Services to come into contact with the Dominions and with other countries. In many places the presence of non-Europeans in the complement of one of H.M. Ships, especially as officers, would be in the highest degree embarrassing for the Service, for the individual and for the authorities on the other side.[CITATION-92] South Africa was frequently identified as one place where \u2018difficulties and unpleasantness\u2019 may be experienced on the basis that \u2018conditions ashore, are such that the coloured officer would be debarred from enjoying many of the amenities available to white officers\u2019.[CITATION-93] The Admiralty also opined that imperial policy and national pride would suffer from a racially inclusive service, arguing in early 1947 that if the king should visit South Africa, the presence of naval personnel of colour would prove politically embarrassing and inhibit ceremonies in the Dominions: \u2018We could hardly allow a coloured officer to be present on such an occasion nor would it be wise to have coloured ratings mixed with white, on any ceremonial parade etc\u2019.[CITATION-94] The Admiralty were also quick to harness shifting colonial situations to their arguments, especially once Indian and Burman independence began to loom large on the imperial horizon. In February 1947, anxieties about the end of British rule in India and Burma were presented as justifying continued blanket racial discrimination in Naval recruitment:Until the future can be more clearly seen, it appears unwise to admit them on permanent engagements, and if this is accepted, undesirable to modify the present regulations at all at the present time, since any discrimination between Indians and Burmese on the one hand and Colonial subjects on the other would surely cause great difficulty.[CITATION-95] Security concerns that men from these nations might be entered for regular service in the Navy and then find themselves in a conflicted situation should India or Burma become a hostile, or even allied, power were cemented as key pillars of the Admiralty\u2019s unyielding position.Again yoking expressions of pseudo-concern for the individual sailor\u2019s happiness to the wider plea that the peacetime Navy ought to receive special dispensation to retain a colour bar, in July 1946 the First Lord of the Admiralty informed the Cabinet that \u2018The welfare of the R.N. is planned on the basis that the United Kingdom is \u201chome\u201d. For instance all sailors have a right to expect to spend some part of their time within reach of their families\u2019.[CITATION-96] Explaining that the Admiralty was mindful of the need to strike an effective balance between time spent ashore and time at sea for the sailor\u2019s morale and health, he reasoned thatIt does not follow because a non-European was living in the United Kingdom at the time of his enlistment that his family and connections would be here. The opposite is more likely. It would not then be possible under the existing schemes of naval drafting for him to be given enough time with this family for his own well-being.[CITATION-97] Once again, the concept that a prospective recruit of colour could conceivably possess African, Asian, or other racial heritage and simultaneously be entitled to identify himself as \u2018British\u2019 and regard Britain as \u2018home\u2019 was entirely ignored.Kushner describes the route to the eventual removal of the colour bar in the armed services in 1947 as a \u2018tortured path\u2019.[CITATION-98] Nowhere is this description more apt than in the Navy\u2019s professed commitment to maintaining a transparent and fair-handed approach to decision-making about post-war regulations and racial discrimination. Having been informed of the impending decision to lift the pre-war regulations concerning \u2018non-Europeans\u2019 in the air force, the Navy expressed deep concern that, should it be obliged to adopt the RAF\u2019s approach, convenientloopholes, such as the nebulous and subjective terrain of personal \u2018character\u2019, by which candidates of colour could currently be refused entry to the RN, would be sealed off. The Admiralty files document deep anxieties that \u2018if a coloured candidate were given no marks for interview he could still be on the successful list if his educational marks were good enough\u2019.[CITATION-99] Furthermore, there is a strong implication in these records that if proposals to remove the colour bar were to be adopted, the Navy\u2019s usual backdoor mechanisms of unobtrusively avoiding the selection of \u2018coloured\u2019 entrants would no longer function so effectively: \u2018it is difficult to believe that the Service Depts. could indefinitely \u201cblackball\u201d every Indian, for example, who applied for a commission\u2019. \u2018Sooner or later\u2019, one senior naval officer cautioned, \u2018the hidden-hand would become obvious, and the political complications would then probably be worse than now exist under the clear-cut and publicly-stated ban\u2019.[CITATION-100] Prospective political and publicity risks of beingto be operating mendacious backdoor strategies of racial discrimination, as opposed to a \u2018cleaner\u2019 overt colour bar, were further outlined in a pompous warning of the inevitability that:the charge of hypocrisy would be added to that of unfair discrimination. It would be almost as dangerous to appear to constrict the application of the principle by administrative action; for if figures were produced showing that a high proportion of non-European candidates had been unsuccessful it might not be entirely convincing to reply that in all cases they were below the standard for Europeans.[CITATION-101] General foreign policy and security concerns were also expediently roped into this discourse of specious reasoning. In early 1947, George Hall, the First Lord of the Admiralty, contended that \u2018Commonwealth interests would be injured more severely if some years after relaxing our entry regulations it was disclosed that no coloured officers had in fact been entered\u2019.[CITATION-102] This self-confident certainty that no officers of colour would enter the Navy may be read as tantamount to full admission that informal practices of racial discrimination would indubitably be used to maintain the colour bar in peacetime regular service. With appreciable hypocrisy, however, the Admiralty claimed that \u2018Whatever we do must be honest and open\u2019.[CITATION-103] Clearly, therefore, the Navy\u2019s primary moral imperative in the immediate post-war period was to avoid the appearance, rather than the actual practice, of racial discrimination.Nevertheless, despite such trenchant opposition to removal of the colour bar for entry to naval service, in early June 1947 the Cabinet concluded that \u2018it would be difficult to justify the retention of an admitted ban on the entry of non-Europeans\u2019 in Britain\u2019s armed forces.[CITATION-104] Arguing that there would be \u2018no need to give wide publicity\u2019 to the Government\u2019s decision to lift the formal colour bar, on 5 June 1947 the Cabinet agreed to follow the example of the RAF in so far as:British subjects and British protected persons of non-European race should be admitted to the Royal Navy and the British Army, provided that they attained the requisite standards, were resident in this country, and could satisfy the selection authorities that they were likely to mix with other entrants and hold their own in the corporate life of the Services.[CITATION-105] This was not remotely the equitable open-door policy of racial inclusion into Britain\u2019s armed services for which civil rights organisations such as the LCP, and the letter-writers discussed earlier, had fought. It continued to leave vast room for \u2018opportunistic flexibility\u2019 in the exercise of racism in recruitment and enlistment practices. As Sherwood notes, although the colour bar was finally removed from naval recruiting instructions in 1948, ultimately there is no way of knowing how frequently this \u2018new administrative ploy\u2019 of rejecting candidates of colour on the tenuous grounds that they might not mix well with other white ratings or officers was employed.[CITATION-106] In twenty-first-century Britain a cultural narrative has sprung up around the idea that the Second World War brought a \u2018redemptive ending\u2019 to racial discrimination in the armed forces.[CITATION-107] Yet the story of racial exclusion and discrimination in the Royal Navy did not end with the lifting of restrictions to wartime service in 1939 or peacetime service in 1947. While the removal of a formal, codified colour bar prohibiting entry to the RN marked an important moment in British race relations, the diffuse system of clandestine naval racism that replaced it became more difficult to challenge openly after the war. The Admiralty archive of 1939\u201347 emphasises that racial discrimination continued to have an impact on enlistment and commissioning in the wartime and post-war Navy in multiple covert ways. The Navy\u2019s ongoing endeavour to circumvent both the 1939 lifting of the colour bar to wartime service and its permanent counterpart in 1947, at the same time as publicly proclaiming the institution\u2019s commitment to equality of opportunity, epitomises Tabili\u2019s \u2018opportunistic flexibility\u2019 in the historical construction and application of \u2018race\u2019 as a mode of categorisation. Resorting to the creation of a plethora of evasive and shadowy strategies to prevent Britons of colour from joining the service, the Admiralty sought to maintain the mid-twentieth century Navy as a racially white community as far as possible. Synthesising language and ideas from inter-war maritime labour unrest, \u2018seafaring race theory\u2019, class prejudice, imperial anxiety and the \u2018cult of the navy\u2019, the Admiralty refined an exclusionary discourse that sought to impose severe limits on the service of seamen whom they considered not \u2018white\u2019 enough. In this way, the Admiralty sought to embed a shared knowledge of the unsuitability of some racial groups for naval service in wartime and early post-war recruitment in the RN. Pleading a special privilege to operate racially exclusionary policies, the Navy shrouded its fierce resistance to the inclusion of ratings of colour in a language of concern for the well-being of these men in a shipboard environment. Under the guise of caring for the rights and protection of the \u2018coloured\u2019 rating, this generated a vicious circuit of \u2018victim blaming\u2019 discourse which locked the \u2018non-European\u2019 sailor into an entrenched status as complicit in his own experiences of racism below decks. What emerges from the archive, therefore, is a two-faced paternalism in the Admiralty that weaponised a language of equality and fairness as a means of tacitly upholding the colour bar and reinforcing practices of racial discrimination in naval recruitment. Wartime naval recruitment of colonial manpower on a massive scale may well, as Spence suggests, have forced some broader \u2018cultural change in British attitudes towards colonial subjects and their \u201cracial\u201d suitability for naval service\u2019 in the colonial navies.[CITATION-108] Nevertheless, this \u2018cultural change\u2019 was not total, and it certainly did not extend to promoting racial inclusivity in Britain\u2019s domestic Navy.Throughout the Second World War era of global imperial flux, the Royal Navy\u2019s opposition to racial inclusivity and equality, and its institutionalisation of covert forms of racial discrimination in naval recruitment, spotlights wider contemporary disputes that were playing out in constructions of \u2018British\u2019 selfhoods. Internal discussions about the profile of the post-war Navy were held against a backdrop of increasingly heated wider political debates about imperial decline, migration from the Commonwealth, demographic change, and nationality laws. By the 1950s a \u2018veritable crisis of national self-representation\u2019 had unfolded in Britain; yet, as the Admiralty files underscore, this \u2018crisis\u2019 began brewing well before 1945.[CITATION-109] Debates over rights to serve in the Royal Navy between 1939 and 1947 saw the deployment of conflicting discourses of national \u2018belonging\u2019 both by naval authorities who were determined to maintain some form of racial barrier to naval service, and by people of colour who protested against the Navy\u2019s racist recruiting practices as being inherently \u2018un-British\u2019. The Admiralty\u2019s race-based \u2018politics of belonging\u2019 that shaped entrance to, and career progression in, the RN undoubtedly formed part of a wider \u2018political project\u2019 to police the racial boundaries of the British nation in the pre-Windrush era. Yet such systemic racism in naval enlistment and commissioning during the Second World War did not go uncontested. Epistolatory challenges sent to the Admiralty by relatives and representatives of men who were rejected on the grounds of racial heritage challenged the racially white \u2018cult of the navy\u2019 to which the Admiralty subscribed, offering competing definitions of Britishness, national belonging, and the right to serve. As the letters from the families and communities of men of Maltese, West Indian and Anglo-Indian British subjects testify, different racial and ethnic groups both in Britain and the colonies during the Second World War articulated a sense of imperial British identity through constructions of the RN as an institution that symbolised the best of \u2018British\u2019 might and justice across the globe. Expressions of desire to \u2018belong\u2019 in the Navy represented part of a dynamic process of identity creation and emotional investment in the nation. Asserting the legitimate claim of people of colour to inhabit naval space and culture during this period was also fundamentally a discussion about feeling \u2018at home\u2019 in Britain and, in Perry\u2019s phraseology, strategically \u2018leveraging claims to imperial belonging and citizenship\u2019.[CITATION-110] In challenging the right of their menfolk to serve in the wartime Royal Navy, therefore, these letter-writers fundamentally contested the wider right of persons of colour to belong as accepted Britons and to consider Britain as \u2018home\u2019 in the pre-Windrush era."

    "text": "The February revolution of 1917 brought about the complete collapse of the tsarist autocracy and offered multiple possibilities for the reorganisation of society based on new principles of democracy, equality and citizenship. Amid societal reconfiguration, the tsarist system for the regulation of prostitution was repealed in July 1917. After this, the Provisional Government and later the Bolshevik Party looked for new methods to prevent the spread of venereal diseases (VD), which had reached epidemic proportions. The regulation of prostitution had been the tsarist government\u2019s main form of VD control and it was frequently attacked by commentators across the political spectrum on both medical and moral grounds in the decades preceding February 1917. Therefore, its abolition was a political project that was interconnected with broader discourses of liberation and efforts to rid society of the unwanted remnants of the old regime. Physicians rallied around the issue of prostitution, and its eternal bedfellow VD, as part of their broader efforts to dominate the public health agenda of the new revolutionary state. In the Russian capital of Petrograd, the February revolution did not disrupt well-established class or gender stereotypes, which had profound implications for the way in which medical professionals and the police dealt with the issues of prostitution and VD. This article examines how experts, state bureaucrats and the police approached prostitution and VD in Petrograd throughout 1917 and 1918. In doing so, it traces continuities in administrative-bureaucratic regimes and informal policing practices across collapsing regimes and governments in revolutionary Russia.In June 1917, the Union of Naval Doctors in Petrograd convened a meeting to discuss a matter of grave importance. Incidence of venereal diseases (VD) had been rising sharply in the Navy since the outbreak of the\u00a0First World War, but now the \u2018revolutionary anarchy [provided] fertile soil for mass contamination and the rampant spread of infection\u2019.[CITATION-1] The Union of Naval Doctors\u2019 concern was not unfounded, as rates of VD had reportedly reached epidemic proportions in the city of Petrograd by the\u00a0summer\u00a0of 1917.[CITATION-2] The \u2018revolutionary anarchy\u2019 that they cited referred to the period following the revolution of February 1917, a series of events of seismic importance that brought about the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, the end of the 300-year reign of the Romanov dynasty, and the complete collapse of the tsarist autocracy.[CITATION-3] In Petrograd, two centres of power emerged to replace the tsarist government: the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet, which uneasily shared authority until the October Revolution. The period between February and October 1917 was marked by a series of successive crises over political power, economic supply, chronic food shortages, war, epidemic disease and rising crime, as well as the widespread mobilisation of various segments of the urban population against the conditions and options offered to them by political elites.[CITATION-4] The rampant spread of VD within the city of Petrograd and the nearby garrison added another layer to the potent atmosphere of crisis in the capital.The collapse of the old regime in February 1917 offered multiple possibilities for the reorganisation of society, as well as the destruction of the symbols and institutions of the tsarist era. Soldiers ripped the epaulettes from officers\u2019 shoulders, the imperial eagle was torn down in public places, and the tsarist police were attacked, disarmed and dissolved.[CITATION-5] In the midst of this societal reconfiguration, the tsarist system for the regulation of prostitution was repealed in July 1917. Regulation had been introduced in 1843 as a method for preventing the spread of VD. Under the system, women engaged in prostitution had to register with the police, attend regular gynaecological examinations, and abide by a whole host of restrictions governing their visibility and behaviour.[CITATION-6] Before 1917, regulation was criticised by commentators across the political spectrum for promoting extramarital sex, exacerbating the sexual double standard, failing to prevent the spread of VD, and encouraging police interference in the lives of lower-class women. Therefore, the abolition of regulation was of great symbolic significance, both for its vocal opponents and for public health experts who seized the opportunity to propose alternative strategies for combatting VD in the months that followed. Despite this radical change, pre-revolutionary practices for policing prostitution continued in Petrograd and other cities throughout 1917 and beyond. The Provisional Government gave public health experts opportunities to formulate new, radical policies in the field of VD control and prevention, but the chaos and multiple political crises of the revolutionary year meant that these proposals largely remained on paper, rather than being implemented in practice.This article uses prostitution and VD as lenses for tracing continuities in administrative-bureaucratic regimes, informal policing practices, and ideologies across collapsing regimes and governments in revolutionary Russia.[CITATION-7] The issues of prostitution and VD were often intertwined in official and popular discourse in this period, but this article addresses them separately\u00a0in order to examine closely two key policy shifts that had their roots in 1917\u20131918, but that continued to influence state approaches to prostitution and VD throughout the entire Soviet period: the shift away from state regulation and the criminalisation of VD transmission. In the process of remaking society out of the ashes of the old regime, new ideologies of equality, democracy and civil rights commingled with enduring ideas about the \u2018immorality\u2019 of VD and the need to police female sexuality for the benefit of public health and morality. 1917 was a year of frenetic change, but the stigmatisation of women who sold sex and paternalistic approaches to VD patients remained constant.Prostitution and VD were ever-present in Russian urban society and issues of fervent discussion among educated elites in the decades preceding 1917.[CITATION-8] However, only a handful of studies integrate these topics into the historiography of revolutionary Russia, and even then, only prostitution is mentioned in passing.[CITATION-9] This is probably because women who sold sex have long been excluded from general histories of migration and labour in pre- and post-revolutionary Russia, despite the fact that they were a group of closely monitored, and predominantly migrant, workers.[CITATION-10] The absence of prostitution and VD in scholarship on the revolution is also a question of sources. Under the regulation system, the tsarist authorities endeavoured to monitor every woman believed to be selling sex across the Russian Empire. This left behind a mass of documentation on urban prostitution and VD, which is now preserved in central and regional archives. In all the archives that I\u00a0have worked in\u00a0in the territory of the former Russian Empire, ample documentation on prostitution exists from the late nineteenth century onwards, but not for the year of 1917. The tsarist administrative organs in charge of policing prostitution disintegrated after the February Revolution, so information on prostitution and VD thereafter must be pieced together from a patchwork of sources, including military files, municipal police records and newspaper articles.The fragmented nature of material on prostitution and VD in 1917 makes it impossible to draw broad generalisations about experiences across Russia, or to access the perspectives of women engaged in prostitution or individuals who contracted venereal infections. Despite these problems with the source base, focusing on prostitution and VD in revolutionary Petrograd provides valuable perspectives on the Provisional Government\u2019s approach to public health and social issues, both themes that remain chronically understudied in the historiography of the Russian Revolution.[CITATION-11] From the material which does survive, we can explore the evolution of ideas regarding health-based citizenship and examine how various groups attempted to claim authority within the emerging societal and political order. Physicians rallied around the issues of prostitution and VD as part of their broader efforts to dominate the public health agenda of the new revolutionary state. The Provisional Government\u2019s recognition of physicians\u2019 expertise on these matters provided a corrective to decades of struggle for professional autonomy and inclusion within the state\u00a0bureaucracy.[CITATION-12] After the February Revolution, Petrograd residents, like non-elites in other regions of Russia, sought engagement with the new organs of government and law enforcement to achieve specific ends, settle old scores, and in the case of prostitution, enforce a specific moral order.[CITATION-13] Histories of prostitution do not map neatly onto political histories, as legislative changes often had little impact on policing practices at the street level.[CITATION-14] The categorisation of women engaged in commercial sex as threats to public health and social order has remained constant across the disintegration of empires and the collapse of political regimes. Many of the new nation states that emerged following the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy kept the pre-existing imperial-era legislation on prostitution.[CITATION-15] After the abolition of the state regulation of prostitution in Sweden, Weimar Germany and France, the police and state-run medical organisations continued to closely monitor and directly intervene in the lives of women suspected to be working as prostitutes.[CITATION-16] Rather than a radical rupture, the specific developments of the Russian revolutions were \u2018germinations of Russia\u2019s broader experience of modernity\u2019 and mirrored practices in radically different political contexts elsewhere on the European continent.[CITATION-17] In the case of prostitution and VD, the events of 1917\u201318 were connected to decades of national and international anti-regulation activism, to the chaos of war, and to the broader pivot towards criminal law as a method for preventing the spread of VD occurring across Europe at the turn of the twentieth century. Epidemic rates of VD raged throughout the First World War and beyond, adding another layer to the \u2018continuum of crisis\u2019 brought about by mobilisation, colossal social dislocation and the disintegration of state structures.[CITATION-18] The road to the abolition of the regulation of prostitution in Russia was long and well-trodden. Amid the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of the late nineteenth century, prostitution became increasingly visible in the urban centres of the Russian Empire, and in turn, a burning issue frequently discussed in philanthropic, political, popular and medical discourse. Charitable organisations devoted to rescuing \u2018fallen women\u2019 bemoaned the tsarist state\u2019s sanctioning of premarital and extramarital sex, while feminist groups criticised the way in which regulation institutionalised a sexual double standard and promoted gender inequality.[CITATION-19] Reform-minded doctors opposed regulation for its failure to prevent the spread of VD and for its violation of women\u2019s civil liberties, and even physicians who supported the principle of regulation branded the existing system ineffective.[CITATION-20] Opponents on the left and right of the political spectrum found common ground in linking prostitution to economic hardship and in moralising about women who sold sex.[CITATION-21] Russian upper-class feminists participated in the wave of anti-regulation activism that broke across Europe and the Americas at the turn of the twentieth century, fuelled by widespread anxiety about the abduction and procurement of white women and girls by ambiguously \u2018foreign\u2019 pimps, a practice referred to as \u2018white slavery\u2019 or the \u2018trade in women\u2019.[CITATION-22] On 8 March 1913, the\u00a0feminist physician Poliksena Shiskina-Iavein managed to arrange the introduction of a bill to the State Duma (Parliament)\u00a0calling for the abolition\u00a0of regulation, which was endorsed by all but two doctor Duma deputies.[CITATION-23] Criticism of regulation also reverberated outside the echo chamber of educated elites. Registered prostitutes wrote letters to the tsarist authorities to protest against one-sided medical examinations and their unfair treatment at the hands of the police.[CITATION-24] Urban residents demanded that state-licensed brothels be moved off their streets or shut down completely. The tsarist government largely ignored this opposition to regulation, but the growing criticism of the system mounted in the years preceding the Empire\u2019s collapse.By the time revolution broke out in February 1917, the regulation of prostitution had become an increasingly political issue, connected to the corruption of the tsarist police, the Empire\u2019s inadequate medical infrastructure, and the crippling injustices of the patriarchal gender order, sexual double standard, and limited opportunities for upward social mobility within Russia\u2019s highly stratified society. Nevertheless, regulation remained in place even after the February Revolution. Amid the upheaval, women\u2019s groups continued to push for the abolition of regulation as an important step in the pursuit of women\u2019s equality, which was not automatically enshrined in law after the collapse of the autocracy and abdication of the Tsar. On 6 March 1917, the Moscow branch of the League for Women\u2019s Equal Rights called for the \u2018abolition of any exclusionary laws applying to prostitution and the abasement of women\u2019s human dignity\u2019 as part of their demands for suffrage, equal pay and equal political representation.[CITATION-25] In their statement, the Moscow branch questioned how the new Russia could actually be considered a free country if their demands were not met, reflecting the wider frustration at the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet\u2019s reluctance to include women\u2019s rights in their respective political programmes.[CITATION-26] Later in March, the League for Women\u2019s Equal Rights organised the largest women\u2019s demonstration in Russian history and forced leaders of the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government to guarantee women\u2019s right to vote.[CITATION-27] On 4 May 1917, the Russian Society for the Protection of Women ([ROZZh]) met in Petrograd to discuss the abolition of regulation. Since its establishment in 1900, the Society had devoted its energies to combatting prostitution through providing \u2018fallen women\u2019 with moral education and material support. ROZZh organised volunteer groups at major railway stations and ports to meet newly arrived peasant migrants and prevent them from becoming acquainted with procurers and pimps.[CITATION-28] Before the February Revolution, the Society\u2019s membership roster had included members of the Imperial family and other elite dignitaries, so it was not a vocal opponent of government policy and therefore never formally campaigned for the abolition of regulation.[CITATION-29] However, the transcript of the May 1917 meeting reveals how the abolition of regulation was now regarded as an urgent necessity. Attendees unanimously agreed that regulation needed to be repealed and planned to present the Provisional Government with the same bill that the State Duma had considered in 1913 in order to apply some pressure.[CITATION-30] One month after ROZZh\u2019s meeting in June 1917, a three-day physicians\u2019 congress was held in Moscow to address the urgent issues of prostitution and one of its key consequences, VD.[CITATION-31] The congress was convened by the Pirogov Society of Russian Physicians, a national medical organisation founded in memory of medical scientist Nikolai Pirogov (1810\u201381). In the final decades of tsarism, the Pirogov Society promoted community () medicine, held regular congresses, fostered efforts for social reform, and became an active political force.[CITATION-32] The Pirogov Society had a complicated relationship with the tsarist government, as members bemoaned the constraints that official interference placed upon their professional practice, but simultaneously sought to expand their roles within the state apparatus, especially as forensic experts within the judiciary.[CITATION-33] After the February Revolution, the Society threw its support behind the Provisional Government, regarding this as its best chance to dominate the new public health agenda.[CITATION-34] The Pirogov Society had not been vocally critical of the regulation system before 1917, preferring to avoid taking a stance on certain politically contentious issues.[CITATION-35] However, at its June 1917 congress, the Society supported the abolition of regulation as an urgent necessity, arguing that prostitution could not be prevented with punitive measures, but\u00a0rather by radical social and healthcare reform.[CITATION-36] One month after the congress in July 1917, the Provisional Government established the Central Medical Sanitary Council to replace the medical institutions of the tsarist regime and to take tentative steps towards centralising healthcare in Russia.[CITATION-37] Within the Central Medical Sanitary Council, a Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases was formed, headed by venereologist Vladimir Ivanov. The Commission met on 19 July 1917 and voted to abolish the regulation system across the country by disbanding medical-police committees and closing state-licensed brothels.[CITATION-38] After more than seventy years of operation and decades of mounting opposition, the Russian regulation system was officially no\u00a0more.The Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases\u2019s vote to abolish regulation marked a rhetorical break with the pre-revolutionary past, but this decision probably had little impact in practice. The Commission was under the authority of the Central Medical Sanitary Council, which had very limited political power throughout the summer of 1917 and had to compete with both a separate military medical council and the Petrograd Soviet\u2019s medical section for influence on public health policy.[CITATION-39] Therefore, it is unclear how the (largely toothless) Commission would have had the political power or resources to change both law and practice across Russia. Additionally, the abolition of regulation had already begun during the final decades of tsarism. Due to the decentralised nature of Russian imperial governance, provincial authorities across the Empire had had significant latitude to adapt regulation in light of regional circumstances before 1917. In the early 1900s, regional authorities in Kiev (Kyiv, Ukraine), Tomsk and Iaroslavl\u2019 chose to revoke the licences of brothel madams in their cities and forced legal brothels to close.[CITATION-40] The medical examination of women registered as prostitutes in these cities continued in theory, but closing brothels would have undoubtedly made it much more difficult for the police to enforce the medical screening of registered women, which they consistently failed to do anyway. The colossal social dislocation of the First World War exacerbated existing deficiencies within the regulation system and made enforcing the medical examination and spatial segregation of registered prostitutes virtually impossible.[CITATION-41] By the time the Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases made their decision to abolish regulation in July 1917, certain city authorities had already beaten them to it. For example, in the Siberian city of Tomsk, regulation had officially ended in June 1917 by order of the City Executive Committee.[CITATION-42] After the February Revolution, medical-police committees\u2014the tsarist organisations in charge of ensuring that registered prostitutes and brothel madams followed the rules of regulation\u2014quickly ceased to exist in certain towns and cities. In the midst of the social and political upheaval, the extremely unpopular tsarist police were dissolved, disarmed, imprisoned and even murdered in Petrograd.[CITATION-43] Police stations were ransacked and huge stacks of police files were thrown into bonfires.[CITATION-44] At the ROZZh meeting in May 1917, the\u00a0venereologist F.A. Val\u2019ter explained that the Petrograd medical-police committee had been washed away by the \u2018revolutionary wave\u2019, just like other similar \u2018vestiges of the past\u2019.[CITATION-45] After this, new police forces were formed, known as militia () to signify a break with the tsarist era. In Petrograd, the tsarist police force was replaced by a variety of different militia organisations: one state-driven body under the authority of the Duma committee, and two organisations independent of central government, the workers\u2019 militia and the Petrograd city militia.[CITATION-46] The disintegration of the tsarist police and formation of new militias also took place in villages and provincial towns across the territory of the former Russian Empire.[CITATION-47] In Petrograd, the abolition of regulation did not abruptly end the centuries-old tradition of classifying women who sold sex as threats to public order, health and morality.[CITATION-48] Even though the tsarist apparatus for policing prostitution collapsed after the February Revolution, officers of the city militia continued to perform the functions of the former medical-police committee, conducting raids on suspected brothels and forcefully transporting women engaged in paid sex to hospital for VD treatment.[CITATION-49] As well as enforcing the rules of regulation, tsarist-era medical-police patrolmen had also been expected to expose \u2018clandestine prostitutes\u2019 by conducting secret surveillance on women identified as suspicious by the police or in denunciations penned by urban residents.[CITATION-50] This directive encouraged patrolmen to monitor \u2018promiscuous\u2019 women and register them as prostitutes, even when there was no concrete evidence to support their suspicions. Regional authorities pressured patrolmen to register as many \u2018clandestine prostitutes\u2019 as possible and used the number of women detained as evidence of the rigour of their local medical-police committees.[CITATION-51] On 16 May 1917, the recently\u00a0formed Petrograd city militia detained a woman for \u2018indecent behaviour\u2019 (), a phrase often synonymous with promiscuity and prostitution in official and popular discourse before 1917.[CITATION-52] In another case, two young women were detained simply \u2018for prostitution\u2019 by the Petrograd militia on 16 September 1917, almost two months after the formal abolition of regulation.[CITATION-53] As the women were found to be infected with VD, presumably following their physical examination performed by the police or a doctor, they were sent to Obukhovskaia hospital immediately for treatment. Sweeping changes to legislation did not reach the street level, as the Petrograd city militia attempted to enforce the detention and hospitalisation of women assumed to be working as prostitutes, just as the medical-police committee before them had\u00a0done.This continuity in policing practices across the February Revolution was not just confined to Petrograd; it was replicated across the territory of the former Russian Empire. In early March 1917, the Provisional Government confirmed that military commanders had the right to deport women believed to be engaged in prostitution from the theatre of conflict, a practice that began in 1915.[CITATION-54] In Tomsk, the city militia continued to detain women suspected of being engaged in prostitution and to examine them for signs of VD, even after the formal end of regulation in the city.[CITATION-55] In Riga, the medical examination of women who sold sex ceased to be police function in May 1917, but the Riga people\u2019s militia () continued to detain and examine suspected prostitutes in the months that followed.[CITATION-56] That the policing of women suspected to be engaging in prostitution persisted after the collapse of the old regime, despite the proliferation of new nodes of power and increased democratisation of state structures, is consistent with those continuities in police functions across the February Revolution which have been observed by other scholars.[CITATION-57] Indeed, the Petrograd militia performed extremely similar tasks to those of the tsarist police, including sanitary inspections, investigating complaints made by the population, and conducting searches.[CITATION-58] The February Revolution did not disrupt administrative regimes in the city of Smolensk either, as the duties and even staff composition of the city militia were remarkably similar to that of the tsarist era.[CITATION-59] In Petrograd, continuity in administrative-bureaucratic regimes was repeated in informal policing practices. A\u00a0report filed by the Petrograd city militia on 23 October 1917 revealed that a war veteran named Ivan Kalil visited the apartment of a certain Mikhail N.\u00a0at 2 a.m. and paid him 15 roubles to have sex with an unnamed woman.[CITATION-60] After he had paid, Mikhail N.\u00a0abruptly asked Kalil to leave, and severely beat him when he refused. Although the Petrograd city militia found that Mikhail N.\u00a0was clearly running a brothel at his apartment, they simply requested that Mikhail N.\u00a0return the 15 roubles to Kalil and took no further action.[CITATION-61] Before the abolition of regulation, brothel keepers had close ties to the tsarist police. A\u00a0well-established system of bribery allowed brothel keepers to pay medical-police patrolman to turn a blind eye to their violations of the rules of regulation, and in some cases, their violent or criminal behaviour.[CITATION-62] In ignoring the assault charges, the Petrograd city militia dealt with Mikhail N.\u00a0leniently, especially when compared to the treatment of women assumed to be engaged in prostitution discussed earlier. Although there is no documentary evidence confirming bribery, as a brothel keeper earning up to 15 roubles per client (an amount significantly higher than the average worker\u2019s daily wage), Mikhail N.\u00a0would have been in a financial position to pay the militia to ensure a favourable outcome.[CITATION-63] Petrograd residents used the new organs of law enforcement as an instrument to settle long-standing disputes about prostitution in urban space. Urban residents called on the Petrograd city militia to close city brothels or to conduct raids on suspected \u2018dens of debauchery\u2019. On 9 June 1917 the militia conducted a raid on the Metropol and Montenegro Hotels on Nevskii Prospekt, after which women believed to be selling sex there were sent to a nearby police station.[CITATION-64] In another case from July, the Petrograd city militia carried out a raid in the Poliustrovo district of the city after residents complained about the \u2018orgies and gambling\u2019 that happened there on a nightly basis.[CITATION-65] Raids of brothels, hotels and teahouses were conducted across the Petrogradskii district on 20 and 21 October, after which the Petrograd city militia detained a \u2018significant number\u2019 of criminals.[CITATION-66] In all these instances, the militia were assisted by groups of soldiers and the public. Elsewhere in the city, urban residents turned to other emerging organs of power in their attempts to shutter brothels. In September 1917, the Kolomenskii District Soviet vowed to forcibly close all brothels in their district after receiving a request to do so from workers at the Franco-Russian factory.[CITATION-67] Public calls for brothel closures and the participation of city residents in brothel raids marked the crescendo of decades of tension bubbling between urban residents and brothel keepers. Brothels were a contentious feature of the towns and cities of the late Russian Empire.[CITATION-68] Under the regulation system, brothels had provided valuable income for medical-police committees, as brothel keepers had been required to purchase licences, pay taxes based upon the number of women employed at their establishments, and at a more informal level, were expected to top up the low salaries of medical-police patrolmen through bribes. The financial relationship between brothel keepers and the police gave the former an elevated status within urban communities, which bred resentment. Urban residents bemoaned the fact that brothels made prostitution increasingly visible (and even audible) within the city. In the decades before the February Revolution, medical-police committees across the Russian Empire received hundreds of petitions from furious urban residents requesting that brothels be shut down or relocated.[CITATION-69] More often than not, city authorities refused these requests, prioritising the income generated from brothel keepers over the moral concerns of the petitioners. After the February Revolution, brothel keepers no longer had the protection of the tsarist police and were more vulnerable to raids and forced closures. Within this context, certain urban residents attempted to reverse traditional hierarchies, settle old scores and claim authority within the emerging moral order.[CITATION-70] The regulation of prostitution was formally abolished in 1917, but rather than a rupture, it merely marked one moment in part of a broader process. In certain cities, brothels had been shuttered and medical-police committees had ceased to operate before the abolition of regulation in July 1917. Despite the rhetorical abolition of regulation, the stigmatisation of women engaged in commercial sex stretched across the revolutionary divide, which had a significant impact on policing practices. In Petrograd and other cities, women who sold sex continued to be classified as threats to public health and morality, and their voices are entirely absent from conversations about combatting prostitution in state, philanthropic and expert discourse. The end of regulation was the outcome of decades of criticism from an increasingly noisy public sphere, the growing professionalisation of physicians, and the participation of elites in international abolitionist activism.After the collapse of the old regime, the Provisional Government inherited a public health crisis, as VD was reportedly rampant within the civilian and military populations in Petrograd and beyond. Public health experts firmly believed that rates of venereal infection had begun to rise sharply during the latter half of the nineteenth century, driven by the interconnected processes of industrialisation, mass seasonal migration and rapid urbanisation. Russian physicians and public officials, like their counterparts abroad, regarded increased VD as another manifestation of the dark side of modern life and indicative of the broader moral and physical degeneration perceived to be infecting humanity at the turn of the twentieth century.[CITATION-71] In 1897, the Ministry of Internal Affairs sponsored a congress in St Petersburg specifically to address the growing syphilis epidemic.[CITATION-72] Throughout the early 1900s, countless articles penned by physicians expressed concern that rates of syphilis and gonorrhoea were constantly increasing in urban and rural settings.[CITATION-73] In 1911, thereported that syphilis was the third most commonly registered disease across the Russian Empire, beaten only by influenza and malaria.[CITATION-74] Another survey from 1914 stated that 10 per cent of all city residents in Revel\u2019 had VD, as well as 6 per cent of St Petersburg inhabitants and almost 5 per cent of all Muscovites.[CITATION-75] The situation was even worse for military personnel, who experienced significantly higher levels of venereal infection in the late imperial period.[CITATION-76] In 1904, military statistics reported that nearly half of all soldiers had syphilis.[CITATION-77] In certain ports and garrisons, the percentage of infected military personnel was far higher.[CITATION-78] In his recent book, Tsuyoshi Hasegawa claims the \u2018VD epidemic\u2019 of 1917 was caused by the end of the regulation of prostitution, as women who sold sex were no longer subject to medical examinations to prevent the spread of infection.[CITATION-79] However, all the available evidence suggests that VD was already widespread in the decades preceding the revolution. Syphilis and gonorrhoea were extremely common among registered prostitutes who were working under regulation and (in theory) subject to regular examinations. The decentralisation of regulation meant that the tsarist government relied on individual municipal authorities to raise the money to pay for the doctors, rooms and instruments required for registered prostitutes\u2019 examinations.[CITATION-80] Municipal governments were subject to various fiscal constraints and often struggled to raise the necessary funds to provide the most basic services for the expanding urban population.[CITATION-81] Because of this, registered prostitutes\u2019 examinations were often conducted in squalid conditions, rushed, and largely futile. Specialist doctors were hired for these examinations, but they were often required to see hundreds of women per hour, which meant that signs of infection were frequently missed.[CITATION-82] Municipal governments also struggled to provide free treatment for registered women who contracted venereal diseases.[CITATION-83] In 1909, almost 40 per cent of all registered prostitutes in European Russia had a venereal infection and almost half of the women registered on the St Petersburg police lists had syphilis.[CITATION-84] The outbreak of war in 1914 further exacerbated the situation. Millions of soldiers contracted diseases during their service and millions more were wounded, which placed enormous strain on the Empire\u2019s already inadequate medical facilities.[CITATION-85] Disease ravaged the civilian population amid immense social dislocation, as millions of Russian subjects were displaced from their homes on the front line to the interior provinces of the Empire.[CITATION-86] Rates of VD soared as medical practitioners were drafted into the war effort and fewer hospital beds were available to venereal patients.[CITATION-87] To make matters worse, the military leadership pursued policies that actively contributed to the widespread circulation of VD. On 16 January 1915, the Supreme Chief of the Medical Directorate of the Military issued Order No. 28, a directive that forbade the admission of soldiers and sailors infected with VD to hospitals unless their disease was in its most severe form.[CITATION-88] Not only did this mean that hundreds of thousands of men with highly infectious VD were evicted from hospitals or simply left untreated, but it also prevented the collection of accurate statistics during the war years.[CITATION-89] After the collapse of the old regime, physicians and military commanders turned their attention to eradicating the VD epidemic. The Pirogov Society held an emergency conference in April 1917 to discuss the healthcare crisis facing the Empire due to the inadequate state of medical services and the extraordinary conditions of wartime.[CITATION-90] After hearing the remarks of various delegates, the Society decided to organise a separate emergency conference specifically to discuss soaring rates of venereal infection a few months later. The All-Russian Pirogov Conference of Physicians for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases met in Moscow on 10\u201312 June 1917 and issued a public statement on how to combat widespread VD shortly afterwards. They insisted on the urgent need for treatment to be organised at hospitals, sanatoria and outpatient facilities, stressed the importance of mass health education, and called on co-operative societies to help fund the cost of medications.[CITATION-91] The call for an urgent response to the VD epidemic was mirrored in the military. At end of May 1917, the Chief Military Medical Inspector wrote to the War Minister outlining the severity of epidemic VD, as he stressed that syphilis had become a grave threat to the health of troops at the front and rear and that stopping the spread of infection was now \u2018a matter of national importance\u2019.[CITATION-92] In late June and early July 1917, the Central Medical Sanitary Council outlined a series of new measures to address VD in the military.[CITATION-93] The blanket ban on the hospitalisation of military venereal patients from 1915 was lifted, and recommendations included preventive measures that reform-minded military physicians had been pushing for decades: widespread popular health education, freely available contraceptives, and universal free treatment for military personnel and civilians.The solutions proposed by the Pirogov Society and the Central Medical Sanitary Soviet provided a corrective to decades of struggle between medical professionals and the tsarist authorities in the realm of VD control. State attempts to prevent the circulation of venereal infection in the tsarist era had been mainly conducted with the involvement of the police and were primarily reactive, involving the examination and forced hospitalisation of specific lower-class populations who were thought to be the primary transmitters of infection, namely women engaged in prostitution, migrant workers and military personnel.[CITATION-94] Various public health practitioners, especiallyphysicians and urban doctors who predominantly served lower-class communities, were extremely critical of forced examinations and hospitalisation, complaining that these practices violated individual liberty and civic rights, served to stigmatise the patient and acted as a disincentive to seeking treatment voluntarily.[CITATION-95] Throughout the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, medical professionals sought greater autonomy in matters related to disease control and an end to the involvement of the police.[CITATION-96] This was part of broader opposition to the constraints placed upon their professional practice by restrictive criminal laws, as well as the quest for official recognition of physicians\u2019 expertise in matters of public health.[CITATION-97] Rather than forced hospitalisation, physicians advocated affordable and available treatment alongside treating the perceived principal causes of widespread VD: poverty, poor housing, insufficient food, hygienic ignorance and the prevalence of unhygienic traditional practices in the countryside, such as communal eating and sleeping.[CITATION-98] Just likemedicine, treatment and health education were ideally to be organised at a local level by provincial organisations specifically dedicating to combatting VD\u00a0and staffed exclusively by specialist physicians with knowledge of the specific characteristics of the region in question.[CITATION-99] Collecting accurate statistics on VD across the Empire was also deemed an urgent necessity.[CITATION-100] The recommendations made by the Pirogov Society and the Central Medical Sanitary Soviet in 1917 appear to have been hypothetical proposals for the future, when the chaos of war had abated and when more state funding was available for medical facilities. The Central Medical Sanitary Soviet insisted that venereal patients were to be treated in field hospitals \u2018equipped with all the necessary medicines and instruments necessary for treatment\u2019 including laboratories for conducting the Wasserman reaction, a highly specialised blood test for the detection of syphilis.[CITATION-101] Special outpatient clinics for less severe cases were also to be established at the front and staffed by dedicated venereological specialists. Only military personnel suffering from the most severe infections were to be evacuated to the rear, where they ought to be admitted to separate military hospitals to prevent them from spreading their infection within the civilian population. These measures would have been impossible to implement in practice: hospitals were severely overcrowded in wartime and there were chronic shortages in medical personnel and supplies. Between 1915 and 1916, 24,623 venereal patients were refused admission at one hospital in Kiev, and one doctor was responsible for 1,500 venereal patients at Moscow general hospital throughout the war.[CITATION-102] Furthermore, after the February Revolution, the army continued to mobilise thousands of physicians, leaving a lack of qualified specialists at the home front throughout 1917.[CITATION-103] Doctors strove to end the coercive practices of the incompetent tsarist government, but they did not envisage a complete end to coercion in the treatment of venereal patients. While criticising government methods, Russian physicians in the late imperial period advocated forcontrol over patients, so long as agency was transferred from unqualified bureaucrats to \u2018\u201cknowledgeable\u201d liberal professionals working for the public good\u2019.[CITATION-104] This continued after the February Revolution, driven by the persistence of paternalistic notions within the medical community about Russia\u2019s vast lower-class population, who were presumed to be na\u00efve, ignorant and in need of direction from those in positions of social, cultural and educational superiority.[CITATION-105] Paternalism was especially potent in approaches to VD, as public health practitioners largely believed that such infections were spread either through lack of self-restraint or because of the low cultural and educational level of the patient. In the countryside, venereal patients were presumed to have contracted their infections through the communal customs of rural life, such as sharing spoons, beds and bowls with infected people. Delegates at the 1897 Syphilis Congress agreed that over three quarters of syphilis patients were such \u2018victims of ignorance and low levels of culture\u2019.[CITATION-106] In contrast, the same diseases were presumed to be spread through sexual contact in urban centres, as lower-class urban dwellers fell victim to the debauched nature of modern city life. This stubborn refusal to regard syphilis and gonorrhoea as sexually transmitted diseases in rural space was part of the educated elite\u2019s idealised perceptions of the Empire\u2019s peasant population as na\u00efve, innocent and in need of paternal protection.[CITATION-107] Laura Engelstein suggests that these epidemiological understandings began to shift in the decade before the 1917 revolutions, as increased peasant mobility and the widespread engagement in the strikes, mutinies and rural unrest of the 1905 revolution shook physicians\u2019 image of the na\u00efve and innocent rural venereal patient.[CITATION-108] However, these ideas were certainly still alive after February 1917. At a meeting of the Central Medical Soviet\u2019s Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases in the summer of 1917, the\u00a0prominent venereologist and dermatologist Oskar Petersen claimed that 97 per cent of syphilis infections were sexually transmitted in urban centres, whereas in the countryside the disease was a \u2018people\u2019s disaster\u2019 () as 85 per cent of cases were spread without any sexual contact.[CITATION-109] His recommendations for controlling syphilis emphasised the centrality of medical experts and the state, who ought to work together to provide universally available (and affordable) treatment. Patients were described exclusively in passive terms, as individuals to be sent to hospital for specific treatments, to be \u2018thoroughly disinfected\u2019 during the contagious stages of their infection or, in the case of soldiers at the front, prevented from returning home if found to be exhibiting symptoms of infection.[CITATION-110] Petersen\u2019s recommendations echoed commonly held views within the medical profession, which largely presumed that lower-class patients were ignorant about the transmission and treatment of VD. This presumption did not necessarily correspond to reality, especially not in the early 1900s when advertisements for medical services, medicines and advice literature filled the pages of mass-circulation newspapers.[CITATION-111] At the same time, rising consumerism and the development of Russia\u2019s internal and international postal system also afforded Russians greater opportunities to place postal orders.[CITATION-112] Within this environment, advertisements for VD cures, as well as rudimentary contraceptive devices, impotence cures and books on a whole host of sexual themes, appeared with increasing frequency.[CITATION-113] There is also evidence to suggest that venereal patients had an awareness of the different treatments available to them and their efficacy in the early 1900s. After the development of the first effective cure for syphilis (arsphenamine, more commonly known as Salvarsan 606 or the \u2018magic bullet\u2019) at the laboratory of the\u00a0German immunologist Paul Ehrlich in 1909, patients in naval hospitals began to demand the treatment as it was both more effective and less painful than the alternative of mercury therapy.[CITATION-114] In June 1911, a riot broke out at the Odessa city hospital when syphilitic patients demanded to be treated with Salvarsan and refused to take any other medications prescribed by doctors.[CITATION-115] Therefore, physicians\u2019 presumptions of ignorance reflected their own assumptions about the na\u00efvety of their lower-class patients and their need for paternalistic protection and guidance.In certain professional circles, the persistence of paternalism in discussions of VD control led to discussions of forced treatment. In September 1917, public health experts gathered in Tomsk to address the various health crises currently facing inhabitants of the region. In their discussions of VD, delegates generally agreed that poverty was a factor contributing to rising rates of infection and remarked on the urgent need for free treatment and health education. Taking the floor, the\u00a0professor of law and historian of medicine Nikolai Novombergskii insisted on the need for compulsory treatment for individuals who were infected with VD:The principle of coercion was discredited under the police system, when it was applied to the majority for the interests of the minority. In a socialist democracy, the principle of coercion will be applied to the minority in the interests of the majority. If it is considered necessary to destroy rotten herring or meat, vaccinate for smallpox, quarantine for the plague, or destroy unhealthy housing, then compulsory treatment for syphilis patients should be imposed \u2026 The idea has developed that coercion in healthcare is incompatible with the demands of public and political freedom. It is time to end this delusion.[CITATION-116] As\u00a0can\u00a0be seen in the above quotation, even though Novombergskii was calling for a continuation of tsarist-era practices, he couched his recommendations in the political language of the era. Other delegates sympathised with his position and insisted that coercive () measures were necessary to combat the \u2018syphilisation\u2019 () of the population.[CITATION-117] The discussions among public health experts in Tomsk echo the broader paternalistic visions of educated elites that stretched across the revolutionary divide. Aaron Retish\u2019s work on Viatka explores how Provisional Government administrators\u2019 perceptions of the peasantry as poorly educated, ignorant and uncultured informed their views on peasant citizenship. Provisional Government elites in this region regarded themselves as \u2018full participants and citizens\u2019 in the broader project to build a democratic Russia, but did not include peasants, and especially non-Russian peasants, as equal partners in this vision.[CITATION-118] Despite the discourses about citizenship and equality\u00a0in circulation, demeaning perceptions of lower-class people held by certain educated elites were \u2018incongruous with democratic ideals of citizenship\u2019 in which all citizens were equal members of the political community.[CITATION-119] Discussions of VD control in summer 1917 revealed new understandings of civic belonging that were founded on social hygienic principles. Good sexual health became an important component of citizenship in the new Russian republic, and the individual had a responsibility to put aside personal desires and bodily autonomy for the benefit of the social body. Experts stressed the importance of Russians becoming \u2018hygienic citizens\u2019, individuals who willingly complied with restrictions on their rights and freedom in the name of preserving and perpetuating the future of the nation.[CITATION-120] A\u00a0handful of doctors at the Tomsk conference agreed that abstinence ought to be mandatory for men and women before marriage and that it was the duty of physicians to dispel any myths about sexual continence being harmful to health.[CITATION-121] In June 1917, the Union of Maritime Physicians in Petrograd called for mandatory periodic examinations of sailors\u2019 genitalia.[CITATION-122] They snubbed the idea of abstinence for military personnel as an unrealistic goal, and instead instructed military doctors to keep accurate lists of sailors who asked for prophylactic devices and medicines, effectively monitoring their sexual activity. One month later, in July, the branch of the Pirogov Society dedicated to VD issued a call for society-wide mobilisation to prevent the \u2018physical and spiritual degeneration\u2019 of the Russian nation that was allegedly brought about by widespread venereal infection. Addressing all Russian citizens, the Society insisted that donating money to the cause of fighting venereal diseases was the responsibility of the public because the government was facing \u2018difficult days\u2019 and could not provide any funding.[CITATION-123] This call for citizens to \u2018compensate for the state disintegration occurring around them\u2019 echoed discussions among tax inspectors in summer 1917 about citizens\u2019 responsibility to pay their taxes and effectively manage their own personal financial budgets.[CITATION-124] Not only did \u2018hygienic citizens\u2019 have a societal responsibility to comply with treatment and inspection regimes, they also had to part with their money to ensure the health of the wider population.Discourse on the health responsibilities of citizenship became especially significant as Petrograd plunged into crisis in\u00a0the summer\u00a0of 1917. Amid a backdrop of deteriorating living conditions, food and fuel shortages, and a devastatingly unpopular military offensive at the front, the Provisional Government faced a series of progressive disasters. The so-called \u2018summer of discontent\u2019 was punctuated by violent clashes between armed demonstrators and government troops in July and an unsuccessful putsch against the Petrograd Soviet organised by General Lavr Kornilov in August.[CITATION-125] Political crisis was accompanied by economic collapse, soaring unemployment and rapid social disintegration.[CITATION-126] Chronic shortages in food, fuel and other essential supplies reached catastrophic proportions, which were further compounded by major problems with supply and transportation.[CITATION-127] At the end of July 1917, the Provisional Government abolished Petrograd\u2019s temporary courts, which deprived city residents of a \u2018state-approved method to satisfy their sense of justice\u2019.[CITATION-128] Thousands of convicts escaped from poorly\u00a0guarded prisons in the city and the incidence of mob justice\u00a0and organised and petty crime dramatically shot up, creating a potent atmosphere of social anarchy, chaos and lawlessness across the capital.[CITATION-129] In this context, critiques of lower-class city dwellers\u2019 use of their new freedoms to advance their own narrow personal interests emerged in the centre and right-wing press, and liberals and moderate socialists urged workers and soldiers to show restraint and responsibility for the \u2018common good\u2019.[CITATION-130] In response, workers and soldiers refuted these claims in public appeals and asserted their willingness to sacrifice their personal interests for the revolution. In doing so, they criticised those who misinterpreted freedom in hedonistic terms, ignoring the \u2018order, responsibility, sense of duty, and moral self-discipline\u2019 that came with \u2018real\u2019 freedom.[CITATION-131] They drew on well-established pre-revolutionary discourses critiquing the growing individualism, moral decay and excess that allegedly permeated life in Russia\u2019s rapidly expanding urban centres around the turn of the twentieth century.[CITATION-132] Stemming the social anarchy of\u00a0the summer\u00a0of 1917 was categorised as the responsibility of individuals, who ought to show restraint and self-discipline in order to ensure the future of the nation. Therefore, maintaining good sexual health was imbued with urgent significance, especially because medical professionals understood VD as illnesses spread through engagement in extramarital and premarital sex in urban centres. Avoiding contracting VD by exercising sexual restraint was necessary for hygienic citizens of the new\u00a0Russia.The Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolshevik party in October 1917 before any discussions about how the state ought to approach the interconnected issues of prostitution and VD were\u00a0translated into co-ordinated state policy. By the\u00a0summer of\u00a01917, many prominent physicians working within the Central Medical Sanitary Soviet had grown frustrated with the slow pace of reform and began to call for more radical solutions, including the disbandment of the Provisional Government and a sharp pivot towards \u2018social democratic\u2019 medicine.[CITATION-133] The limited fiscal and administrative resources available to the Provisional Government meant that the VD epidemic continued to rage throughout 1917 and beyond. In January 1918, the Chief of the Sanitary Division of the Northern Front wrote to the Petrograd Soviet expressing concern about the continued rise in the incidence of syphilis and gonorrhoea. The potent combination of the long-term impact of tsarist-era policy, the absence of doctors at the rear, poor discipline in the army, the breakdown of railway transportation and the chronic lack of funding for the co-ordination of medical treatment meant that VD had reached \u2018terrifying\u2019 levels and now \u2018the degeneration of future generations\u2019 was apparently a very real possibility.[CITATION-134] After the Bolsheviks\u2019 seizure of power and an initial period of hesitation, most of the physicians in the Central Medical Sanitary Soviet joined efforts to construct a system of social medicine.[CITATION-135] Continuities in personnel meant that rather than a radical rupture, approaches to VD after the October revolution built upon long-standing assumptions about venereal patients as well as broader conceptions of health-based citizenship that were in circulation among medical experts in spring and summer\u00a01917.VD treatment became more available and accessible for Petrograd residents after the Bolsheviks\u2019 seizure of power. In 1918, the Bolsheviks took steps towards establishing a state-led campaign to combat VD. Rather than swift centralisation and the rapid nationalisation of the healthcare economy, this process was gradual, very much driven by local actors, and largely dependent on the co-operation of staff at Petrograd\u2019s clinics and hospitals.[CITATION-136] The existing Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases that had been founded after the February revolution was absorbed into the administrative structures of the Commissariat for Health. Thereafter, a Central Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases was set up in Moscow (the new Russian capital after March 1918)\u00a0and subsidiary organisations were established in other towns and cities.[CITATION-137] The Petrograd iteration was the Venereological Soviet, headed by Evgenii Pervukhin\u00a0of the Commissariat for Health for the Northern Commune.[CITATION-138] The Venereological Soviet first met at the end of April 1918 at its headquarters in the Women\u2019s Medical Institute.[CITATION-139] They immediately began collecting accurate statistics on rates of venereal infection, conducting a thorough audit of clinics and treatment facilities in the city, and sourcing demonstration materials for a public lecture series, including dummies and models that had been stored in the basement of Anichkov Palace for safekeeping during the revolution.[CITATION-140] Over the course of 1918, various city hospitals were ordered to offer free open-admission outpatient treatment for a couple of hours each day or evening and previously defunct clinics were renovated and re-opened.[CITATION-141] That being said, efforts to make treatment more available were not without their teething problems. In June 1918, a certain Dr Belkin wrote to Pervukhin regarding issues with his newly opened outpatient clinic on Bol\u2019shoi Prospekt in the Petrogradskii district. Although Belkin had bought all the necessary medical supplies and hired staff, he was unable to offer treatment to city residents because the Belgian Electric Society refused to release the necessary electric current to the clinic.[CITATION-142] Despite healthcare reform, state approaches to prostitution in Petrograd were marked by glaring continuities both in ideology and practice. On 5 October 1918, the regional Soviet for the city\u2019s Petrogradskii district reinstituted compulsory medical examinations for women engaged in prostitution, with non-attendance carrying an extremely steep fine, forced labour or even deportation from the city.[CITATION-143] Six days later the Executive Committee for the Northern Commune cancelled the order and instructed the Venereological Soviet to establish a special commission specifically on the issue of prostitution.[CITATION-144] The commission, known as the Petrograd Commission for the Struggle with Prostitution, largely repeated Marxist interpretations of prostitution as a product of women\u2019s economic and political inequality and advocated state-led solutions, such as providing women with work, housing and education.[CITATION-145] Despite this, other comments made during the meeting presented prostitution as the consequence of women\u2019s exposure to the \u2018vice\u2019 and temptation of modern Petrograd. Gorin, the representative from the Commissariat for Justice, recommended censoring \u2018seductive\u2019 films at the cinema, as they apparently caused sexual arousal and, by extension, drew women into paid sex.[CITATION-146] The representative from the Commissariat for Social Welfare called for the organisation of special groups at train stations to meet young female migrants and help them find \u2018honest work\u2019, an approach already trialled by the elite philanthropic organisation ROZZh in the early 1900s.[CITATION-147] This mix of economic, social and moral explanations set the precedent for state approaches to prostitution in the following decade. Throughout the 1920s, Soviet state officials continued to cling to pre-revolutionary stereotypes about the \u2018type\u2019 of women who engaged in prostitution, despite officially subscribing to Marxist interpretations of prostitutes as blameless victims of capitalism. The stigmatisation of women engaged in paid sex endured for the remainder of the Soviet period, and often disrupted any meaningful attempts to address women\u2019s economic and social inequality.[CITATION-148] Discussions about the eradication of prostitution occurring in Petrograd in November 1918 also reflected the broader movement towards criminal law as a method for preventing the spread of venereal diseases that occurred both within Russia and across Europe in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In that month, members of the Petrograd Commission for the Struggle with Prostitution called for the introduction of a new criminal statute to prosecute individuals who infected others with VD (through sexual contact or otherwise), as well as individuals who failed to disclose a venereal infection to a sexual partner or a close contact.[CITATION-149] The Russian Empire\u2019s criminal code had featured a series of laws criminalising individuals who deliberately transmitted infectious diseases, as well as physicians and police officers who failed to report cases of infectious diseases to the appropriate authorities.[CITATION-150] However, an article criminalising the deliberate transmission of venereal infections alone appeared in the first Soviet criminal code of\u00a01922, and this particular article remained in place until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.[CITATION-151] Here, Soviet Russia was part of a bigger international trend, as the regulation of prostitution was replaced by legislation penalising individuals for spreading venereal infections in various European countries in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[CITATION-152] The introduction of pronatalist and disease-control initiatives across the continent in the aftermath of the First World War was in part driven by concern about falling birthrates, which had a negative impact on a nation\u2019s ability to build the large armies required for modern warfare. In the Soviet context as elsewhere, the anti-VD law that was proposed in 1918 and introduced in 1922 was used as a method for thecriminalisation of women engaged in paid sex, who continued to be regarded as a threat to social order and public health long after the revolutions of 1917.The February Revolution of 1917 offered new possibilities for the re-organisation of society and the destruction of the vestiges of the tsarist past, but the chaos and multiple political crises of the revolutionary year placed limits upon how much could be achieved in practice. One such pre-revolutionary vestige was the regulation of prostitution, which had strong associations with the corruption of the tsarist police, the social and gendered inequalities of late imperial society, and the imperial government\u2019s unwillingness adequately to ensure the health of its subjects. The abolition of regulation in the\u00a0summer\u00a0of 1917 marked a radical break with the pre-revolutionary past. Abolishing regulation was an attempt by physicians to exert influence on public health policy within the emerging regime and a political project that was interconnected with broader discourses of liberation and efforts to rid society of the unwanted remnants of the old regime. However, in Petrograd, the revolution did not disrupt well-established class or gender stereotypes, and this had profound implications for the way in which medical professionals and the police approached the issues of prostitution and\u00a0VD.Throughout 1917, discussions of VD also drew on well-peddled stereotypes about the ignorance of lower-class patients and their need for the paternalistic guidance of medical experts, although these discussions were now couched in terms of the dominant discourses of citizenship and democracy. In the wake of an ongoing VD epidemic, ideas of civic belonging commingled with social hygienic principles and good sexual health became an important component of citizenship in the new Russian republic. The idea that individuals had a responsibility to sacrifice their individual sexual desires for the benefit of wider public health was in circulation in the\u00a0summer of\u00a01917, and this would later become a cornerstone of state approaches to VD in the Soviet Union. The shift toward the criminalisation of VD transmission was an extension of ideas that had developed before the Bolsheviks\u2019 seizure of power and the formation of the Soviet\u00a0Union."

    "text": "This article explains why \u00c6thelflaed, ruler of Mercia, mattered to writers of history in twelfth-century England. It argues that these writers evaluated and compared rulers based not on sex or bloodline, but on the quality of a ruler\u2019s achievements relative to the set and scale of challenges the ruler faced. They thought \u00c6thelflaed remarkable because her triumphs for Mercia distinguished her from other rulers. The article shows that a new understanding of attitudes in twelfth-century England towards rulers, past and present, is required. It accounts for the absence of gendered comments about rulers, as well as the presence of non-binary concepts of gender, in medieval writing. It also challenges the enduring idea that Latin writers imposed a shared, Wessex-dominated national vision on the English past. They asserted Mercia\u2019s independence under \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s sole rule, which shows that English regional interests persisted in the historical imagination long after the Norman Conquest.In early twelfth-century England, when the Empress Matilda and Stephen of Blois vied for the throne, writers of history deemed \u00c6thelflaed of Mercia (d. 918) among the greatest rulers of the past. For writers well-acquainted with ancient emperors and English kings, this was a remarkable historical verdict. Before the English kingdom formed, \u00c6thelflaed ruled Mercia, a kingdom later conquered by her brother, Edward the Elder of Wessex, and absorbed into his territory. Her legacy was not the legacy of a ruler whose realm and issue long outlived her. Yet for Henry of Huntingdon, writing in the heart of the former kingdom of Mercia, she was greater than Caesar, and by a larger measure than William the Conqueror was.Until now, readers have assumed that factors outside \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s control explained her impact on twelfth-century thinking. She was female, so the prospect of Empress Matilda\u2019s rule of England must have awakened historical interest in \u00c6thelflaed. She was King Alfred\u2019s daughter, so writers of English history must have perceived her rule in Mercia as an arm of the far-reaching House of Wessex, a royal family about to effect the forming of a single English kingdom. These factors lack explanatory power. What mattered was what she did.The aim of this article is to explain why \u00c6thelflaed, ruler of Mercia, mattered to writers of history in twelfth-century England. To do so, it establishes the grounds on which they thought her a peerless leader. It argues that they evaluated and compared rulers based not on sex or bloodline, but on the quality of a ruler\u2019s achievements relative to the set and scale of challenges the ruler faced. They thought \u00c6thelflaed remarkable because her triumphs for Mercia distinguished her from other rulers.The article will show that a new understanding of attitudes in twelfth-century England towards rulers, past and present, is required. This understanding needs to account for the absence of gendered comments about rulers, as well as the presence of non-binary concepts of gender. It will suggest, too, that regional interests persisted in the historical record not only before and during,[CITATION-1] but also long after, the Norman Conquest. These writers\u2019 shared assertion of Mercia\u2019s independence under \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s sole rule brings under scrutiny the enduring idea that Latin writers imposed a shared, Wessex-dominated, national vision on the English past. They did not look at \u00c6thelflaed and see a female ruler. They saw things from her perspective\u2014as a ruler, looking at what was at stake for the Mercian kingdom at the turn of the tenth century.A brief introduction to these writers, and to the current understanding of their views of \u00c6thelflaed, will be useful here. William of Malmesbury, the erudite, inquisitive Benedictine monk, completed his(1125, revised by 1127) after Henry I\u2019s male heir William Adelin drowned in the White Ship disaster of 1120. A witness to councils\u2019 negotiations about the conflict between Matilda and Stephen, he also wrote(early 1140s) about recent history. The monk John of Worcester directed the team-written(completed by 1141, extended by the Gloucester continuator through 1143). Henry of Huntingdon, a secular cleric, wrote and revised his(during 1129\u20131154); the Cistercian monk Aelred of Rievaulx, writing in Northumbria, elaborated on Henry\u2019s work in his mid-twelfth-century.[CITATION-2] William and Henry wrote discursive histories, Aelred framed his historical narrative as a genealogy, and John translated and adapted Anglo-Saxon Chronicle annals from Old English into Latin. The mid-twelfth-century, written exclusively about current events, provides an essential perspective on the language and stakes of contemporary rulership.It may be surprising that the question of \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s significance to these writers as a ruler has never been asked. In presuming the primacy of gender, existing analytical categories preclude asking whether gender mattered to their thinking about good rulership, and, if so, how. In studies of women, queenship, and kingship alike, the real comparisons that medieval writers made between rulers across (or without reference to) sex and gender are ignored. It is therefore imperative to investigate \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s true importance in their comparative historical thinking.\u00c6thelflaed and her legacy in twelfth-century England have been treated only in enquiries into gender[CITATION-3] or queenship,[CITATION-4] even though she was not a queen. It has long been accepted that Anglo-Norman writers saw \u00c6thelflaed as prefiguring Matilda because the two rulers were women.[CITATION-5] On the other hand, scholarship on twelfth-century ideas in England about rulership tends to concentrate exclusively on kings, not rulers, thus overlooking \u00c6thelflaed.[CITATION-6] Aelred\u2019s praise for \u00c6thelflaed has been discussed in relation to his views of women (read as either negative[CITATION-7] or positive[CITATION-8] ), not his views of rulers.[CITATION-9] It has been argued, too, that female patronage shows that \u2018gender was decisive\u2019 in influencing chronicles\u2019 structure and content.[CITATION-10] But is this how contemporaries thought? To ask how twelfth-century writers viewed \u00c6thelflaed as a \u2018female ruler\u2019 embeds an assumption: that they perceived being female as the defining element of her rulership.To establish why these twelfth-century writers considered \u00c6thelflaed an outstanding ruler, this article takes rulership, not gender, as the primary framework: where command is the constant, how did writers think about the variable qualities of different leaders? This requires a three-part approach. First, because the \u2018female ruler\u2019 framing has thrown \u00c6thelflaed and Matilda together as self-evident comparanda, we must discover whether gender (and gendered language) had any bearing on the titles twelfth-century writers assigned to rulers; and we must determine on what grounds writers discussed views of the rulership of Matilda and her contemporaries. This first section will show that, where gendered language appeared, it was applied to both men and women, and used exclusively along political lines (favourably for allies and as an insult to enemies). It will argue that Stephen and Matilda\u2019s disputed claim to the English throne was discussed on the basis of their right to rule, and in terms of the quality of each as a ruler. The dispute was not interpreted in gendered terms. There is no evidence that Matilda was evaluated as a \u2018female ruler\u2019 and compared to \u00c6thelflaed for that reason.Because kingship studies have omitted \u00c6thelflaed, the second section examines writers\u2019 views of \u00c6thelflaed and other rulers to whom they implicitly and explicitly compared her. This part will consider the significance of the different but overlapping sets of evidence for past rulers used by each writer. It will argue that they compared \u00c6thelflaed to other rulers on the basis of shared or similar challenges and achievements, without regard to gender. \u00c6thelflaed they judged superior because she was personally successful as an autonomous ruler.The third, concluding section shows why the findings of sections I and II matter for our understanding of these writers\u2019 thinking about English histories. This part will argue that these twelfth-century writers regarded Mercia\u2019s past as contested, that siblings might both co-operate and compete as rulers of different entities, and that conquest could not quell memories of resistance, strong lordship and independence. Twelfth-century writers could see, as they imagined the world from a tenth-century vantage point, that the former English kingdoms could well have had very different futures.In translating Latin, a language which has grammatical gender, into English, which does not, there is a risk of conflating grammatical gender with gendered language. Grammatical gender is a classification of word-forms, whereas gendered language ascribes a gendered quality of meaning to its subject.andwe translate as \u2018conqueror\u2019: the person, man or woman, engages in the same activity, conquering. Yetis generally translated \u2018lord\u2019 and\u2018lady\u2019, which can imply a consort-like role: it neither conveys the activity of ruling, nor invites comparison with other rulers, as readily as \u2018lord\u2019. In Latin, the fact of being male or female requires the masculine or feminine form of the word. This categorical demand disambiguates male and female conquerors. It gives no information about a qualitative difference in meaning between men and women conquering, or being lords. Because the language requires a gendered ending, the word form on its own cannot tell us anything about the author\u2019s intention to ascribe a masculine or feminine quality to conquering.Narrative and historical context illuminates medieval use, allowing us to determine whether emphasis lies on an activity, or a gendered characterisation of that activity.is an example of gendered language: the object is to characterise behaviour as \u2018manly\u2019.and, though respectively terms for a man and a woman, carry no connotation of behaving in a \u2018manly\u2019 or \u2018womanly\u2019 manner. Medieval writers commonly usedto mean \u2018ruler\u2019 or \u2018lord\u2019: a person who exercised real and recognised authority over others. Domesday Book shows that both men and women held and managed lands as independent lords ().[CITATION-11] As ruler of Mercia, \u00c6thelflaed issued charters as[CITATION-12] and;[CITATION-13] the Mercian Anglo-Saxon Chronicle annals, discussed below, used, the Old English equivalent of(lord).In the twelfth century, terms for rulers posed the challenges of distinguishing one ruler from others and signalling independent rule. Bothandwere potentially ambiguous. Twelfth-century English rulers could hold both regal and lordly titles, or usefor.[CITATION-14] Manyruled in twelfth-century Wales and Ireland, wheredid not connote the same wide-ranging overlordship as in England and Scotland.[CITATION-15] Owain Gwynedd famously styled himselfof Wales after the Roman imperial title, rather than, which angered Henry II because it appeared to claim lordship over multiple kingdoms of Wales, rather than Gwynedd alone.[CITATION-16] The existence of people with the same royal title\u2014and especially the same name\u2014was likely to cause confusion. After Henry the Young King was crowned king of England () in 1170 while his father Henry II held the throne and the same title, contemporaries had to resort to(\u2018son-king\u2019) or(\u2018young king\u2019) for the former and(\u2018father-king\u2019) for the latter.[CITATION-17] In medieval Europemost often denoted consort, a role which became more formally recognised over time, but signified no independent political influence.[CITATION-18] In Wales and Ireland, \u00c6thelflaed was known as \u2018queen\u2019, a term with no special connection to authority.[CITATION-19] The Annals of Ulster showed her rulership through her story rather than her title: she responded to calls for aid, acted as an overlord, and possessed an excellent reputation as \u2018most famed queen of the Saxons\u2019 (); the Annals marked her death (but not those of the West Saxon kings Alfred and Edward) as though invoking a regnal year.[CITATION-20] The author ofusedin multiple senses: for Empress Matilda\u2019s brief rise to power during Stephen\u2019s captivity, for Stephen\u2019s wife Queen Matilda as regent and as king\u2019s wife, and for London, \u2018queen and capital of the whole kingdom\u2019 ().[CITATION-21] The terms(lord of England) and(lord of the English) have been interpreted as meaning authority exercised prior to an anticipated coronation. George Garnett has suggested that Richard I\u2019s clerks styled himafter Henry II\u2019s death in 1189 in order to assert Richard\u2019s \u2018royal jurisdiction\u2019 before his coronation, and that this may have inspired King John to be variously styled,andin 1199 prior to his.[CITATION-22] Stephen Church has shown that the termhas a longer history of use in this sense: for John as lord of Ireland in 1185, and\u2014as\u2014Empress Matilda as lord of England in 1141.[CITATION-23] This concept thus occurs first in the grammatical feminine form. That same form could be ambiguous: Henry I\u2019s second wife, Adeliza, was known asbefore her coronation as queen consort in 1121,[CITATION-24] but a consort was not an independent lord.The disambiguation problem extended to what rulers ruled. When Stephen was captured in February 1141, he could not freely exert lordship, but was still the crowned king of England ().[CITATION-25] After negotiations between the Empress and Henry of Blois, Matilda was namedat the Council of Winchester in April.[CITATION-26] Karl Schnith observed in 1976 a key nuance of these negotiations: Henry of Blois\u2019s party preferredfor Matilda because it reflected her status as Henry I\u2019s heir and echoed Adeliza\u2019s pre-coronation consort title.[CITATION-27] Matilda herself may have preferred, as her seals style her.[CITATION-28] had no specific legal status in 1141;[CITATION-29] paired with, it disambiguated Matilda from the queen consorts Matilda of Scotland (her mother) and Matilda of Boulogne (Stephen\u2019s wife), as well as Adeliza. Stephen might yet rule the realm of England, but the Empress ruled the English people. The author of, silent about the council (and perhaps her preference), called her, butunmodified.[CITATION-30] Ambiguity prompted creative solutions. Where writers asserted lordship, past and present, clarity was more important than consistency. Matilda\u2019s charters used bothvariants;[CITATION-31] she was called, and styledon three different coins that follow the design of William I\u2019s.[CITATION-32] To distinguish the roles of different Matildas, the Gloucester continuator styled Stephen\u2019s wifeand Matilda(\u2018lord empress\u2019).[CITATION-33] With different strategies and titles, her advocates sought to mark her out as a commander.The problem for contemporaries was not one of gender, but of signalling rulership where it was not obvious. In the twelfth century this problem was shared by the uncrowned rulers Matilda, Richard and John, and by the concurrent rulers Henry II and Henry the Young King. For \u00c6thelflaed, wherewas the obvious Latin translation of, no Anglo-Norman writer usedalone, because it was not precise enough to signal a person who ruled. John of Worcester (directly translating the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle) used; Henry of Huntingdon used,[CITATION-34] ,, and, to show that she wielded power and conquered in her own person, not as heir or consort. That \u00c6thelflaed and Matilda were women is not sufficient reason to decide that Henry\u2019s termfor \u00c6thelflaed (often cited apart from his other appellations for her) was a coy reference to Matilda.[CITATION-35] Context and modifiers, not isolated words or gendered endings, made meaning.If grammatical gender did not mean ruling \u2018as a woman\u2019, did contemporaries deploy gender in their arguments about good, and legitimate, rulership? The author ofcriticised behaviour with gendered language, doing so in a partisan way. He did not extend this language to the legitimacy of rulers\u2019 claims or contemporaries\u2019 recognition of their lordship. Stephen, though often compared to the corrupted king Saul,[CITATION-36] was \u2018manly\u2019 (),[CITATION-37] and his wife Queen Matilda a \u2018manlike woman\u2019 () for leading others in battle and in sentiment.[CITATION-38] In the early medieval works of Gregory of Tours and Bede, queens consort won victories by begging their military husbands to show compassion and piety.[CITATION-39] In, the Queen won compassion from the enemy with tears,[CITATION-40] the king was \u2018always full of compassion\u2019 (),[CITATION-41] Stephen\u2019s men were compassionate,[CITATION-42] and Stephen moved his captors to genuine, tearful compassion for him.[CITATION-43] Those not \u2018moved\u2019 () by compassion were barbarous mercenaries; they\u2014and the Empress\u2014lacked the(\u2018deepest feelings of mercy\u2019) exhorted by Gregory the Great.[CITATION-44] On Stephen\u2019s side, both men and women had innate virtues of strength, mercy, and tears.By contrast, the Empress\u2019s advocates inwere unmanly and she unwomanly, revelling in being called queen. This latter claim is often cited out of context.[CITATION-45] In the same sentence the author states that many of Stephen\u2019s followers switched their allegiance to Matilda (some because of fortune; others with free will), and that Matilda made herself \u2018queen of all England\u2019 (). Despite his scorn for Stephen\u2019s enemies, the author affirmed that Matilda became, and was recognised as, a lord of men and ruler of England. Where partisan concerns were not involved, gendered language vanished:attributed initiative and agency to Eleanor (duchess of Aquitaine in her own right, and previously married to Louis VII of France) in claiming that she chose Henry II of England as her husband.[CITATION-46] A woman could be, and was, a powerful leader, whether the author described her behaviour in gendered language (the Queen and the Empress) or not (Eleanor).For Henry of Huntingdon, Matilda\u2019s behaviour was not characteristically gendered. On one occasion, he described Matilda\u2019s conduct in gendered language: she put the imprisoned king in chains, \u2018incited to a woman\u2019s brief vexation\u2019 ().[CITATION-47] On another, he wrote that Matilda was lifted () to \u2018lofty pride\u2019 () \u2018because\u2019 () the chances of war had brought prosperity to her supporters.was the familiar fault of a ruler who trusted unwisely in fortune, not God, as with the German emperor and the French king in Henry\u2019s account of 1148.[CITATION-48] For Henry, this fault was not, as the later writer William of Newburgh rewrote the passage, one of \u2018womanly arrogance\u2019 ().[CITATION-49] Imagining Matilda as a prospective and unprecedented female ruler,[CITATION-50] twentieth-century historians conjectured that Matilda\u2019s gender was the main reason for scepticism towards her claim in England[CITATION-51] \u2014no one wanted \u2018a woman\u2019 to rule[CITATION-52] \u2014but, as Jean Truax demonstrated, there is no evidence that contemporary writers and political actors held this view.[CITATION-53] No one made that argument. There was no principle by which it was a valid or viable argument to make. As Marjorie Chibnall observed, \u2018What mattered was the practical ability to seize power and secure formal recognition with coronation and unction\u2019.[CITATION-54] The practical matters discussed by contemporaries were wealth, presence, and foreign relations; the matters of principle were right, legitimate birth, and oaths.A ruler\u2019s presence and response time were explicit concerns during contested rule. The author ofclaimed that nobles preferred Stephen because of his wealth (he, like Henry I, seized the treasury at Winchester), generosity, high birth, and presence in a threatened kingdom. The latter, held the author, was decisive: he argued that Stephen was crowned because of his rapid arrival, his brother Bishop Henry\u2019s support, and frequent meetings with his followers.[CITATION-55] In John\u2019s, rulers almost always hasten.[CITATION-56] Other writers, looking back on periods of disputed rule, showed rulers lamenting that they could not be in multiple places at once.[CITATION-57] Matilda\u2019s delay in coming to England raised questions about her management and her material ability to support English nobles, many of whom had interests and property in Normandy.[CITATION-58] Foreign marriage offered the promise of alliance and the spectre of foreign influence. William of Malmesbury, a Matilda supporter, acknowledged the latter risk candidly in his. If Matilda became ruler of England, some thought her husband, Count Geoffrey of Anjou, might wield real power.[CITATION-59] This concern might seem rooted in an assumption that the male would dominate.[CITATION-60] According to William, however, the problem was that a ruler, in this case Henry I, had acted independently of his advisors. Roger of Salisbury resented that no one was consulted about the arranged marriage,[CITATION-61] an implicit criticism not of Matilda but of her father. William and Henry perceived the same risk\u2014foreign marriage and a spouse who might prove a dominant influence\u2014in the marriage of \u00c6thelred II (\u2018the Unready\u2019) to Emma of Normandy in 1002. They thought this foreign dominance was catastrophically realised with the Norman Conquest in 1066, because William I claimed the English throne through kinship with Emma.[CITATION-62] A woman could and did inherit in the absence of male heirs[CITATION-63] and was, in some cases, preferred to a male child. As Sara McDougall has shown, the persistent assumption that legitimacy mattered decisively by this point in the twelfth century is based on anachronistic readings of canon law and insufficient attention to real elite practice. Her finding is important to the present enquiry, because it means that we can discard the idea that Henry I\u2019s son Robert of Gloucester would have been chosen to succeed because he was male, if only he were legitimate. In a letter for the Empress about, William wrote that no one else he wrote about in that book\u2014\u2018neither any king nor any queen\u2019 ()\u2014had a more regal, more splendid hereditary right to rule the kingdom of the English than Matilda.[CITATION-64] The idea of Matilda\u2019s distinction was meant to flatter his new patron. What is important is that he distinguished her, not among women or queens, but among all royalty in history.In shaping a ruler\u2019s inheritance choices at this time, more important than a child\u2019s legitimacy was the status of the mother\u2019s family, both her ancestors and her living relatives.[CITATION-65] In Matilda\u2019s case it was also more important than gender. Henry I chose Matilda not because Robert of Gloucester was illegitimate, but because Matilda\u2019s mother, Matilda of Scotland, was a crowned queen of English and Scottish royal blood and her family had powerful royal allies in Britain and Europe. Empress Matilda herself was \u2018born to the purple\u2019: to a crowned king and a crowned queen, as her father had been;[CITATION-66] and, by the time of her designation as heir in 1126, she was a wealthy European lord in her own right. After her brother\u2019s death, Matilda was not a reluctantly selected substitute for the (unfortunately illegitimate) male, Robert of Gloucester. She was Henry\u2019s first choice as heir for dynastic and pragmatic reasons.The papal court of 1139 heard Stephen and Matilda\u2019s claims on the basis of right (): the parties debated the validity of oaths and legitimate birth. Although Matilda\u2019s legitimacy was raised, through the old question of whether her parents\u2019 marriage was valid if her mother had been veiled as a nun,[CITATION-67] the issue of legitimacy had negligible force in the discussion.[CITATION-68] In the 1160s, John of Salisbury framed the pope\u2019s reconfirmation of Stephen\u2019s kingship as an acceptance of Stephen\u2019s gift, implying that it was the king\u2019s persuasive wealth that had won papal support.[CITATION-69] Contemporaries discussed oaths in terms of compulsion and integrity. William, for example, judged Harold II and Stephen too cavalier with oaths and thought the people suffered as a result.[CITATION-70] According to some, the terms of the oath to Matilda were exacting, unconditional, and \u2018extracted\u2019 () by Henry I.[CITATION-71] Others argued that her inheritance, and the oath affirming it, were valid and binding. William, an eyewitness at the papal court, related the argument of the Empress\u2019s supporters: she should rule because she was Henry I\u2019s daughter and all England and Normandy were \u2018sworn\u2019 () to her.[CITATION-72] Henry of Huntingdon lamented the breaking of the oath; John claimed the \u2018bonds of peace\u2019 () were corrupted with Stephen\u2019s accession.[CITATION-73] None ascribed the oaths to fears about a woman being accepted as lord. William observed that Matilda held many continental possessions, and Lombard and Lotharingian princes petitioned repeatedly for her to be their lord.[CITATION-74] Henry I required the oath sworn to Matilda to be repeated, and repetition was not unusual: charters were reissued and reconfirmed, homage performed again. Rulers were normally anxious to ensure their heirs\u2019 succession. Edward the Confessor tried multiple times to bring a family heir into the orbit of his court;[CITATION-75] the still-hale Henry II had his eldest son pre-emptively crowned king. Even according to the author of, the contemporary writer most critical of Matilda\u2019s behaviour,[CITATION-76] English nobles argued the case for crowning Stephen in 1126 based on the oath\u2019s validity.[CITATION-77] Justice and right were the sinews of argument, and the nobles wanted the ruler who would best support their interests.In twelfth-century England, terms for rulers and discussions of rightful rule were not framed in gendered language. We turn now to what writers wrote of rulers more removed from their present: their views of \u00c6thelflaed and other rulers. The significance of their narratives depends on their interpretations of their sources, so a brief introduction to these is warranted.What we know of \u00c6thelflaed is that she was the daughter of King Alfred of Wessex and Ealhswith (of Mercian descent). She married \u00c6thelred, lord of the Mercians, probably in the 880s when Alfred forged an alliance with Mercia to defend against Scandinavian incursions. She acted as regent during her husband\u2019s illness, and the Mercians chose her as their ruler upon his death in 911.[CITATION-78] Asshe founded towns and churches, led armies, and built alliances.To twelfth-century writers, the decade of the 910s would have seemed a turning point in Anglo-Saxon history. Scandinavian invasions on two fronts beset the allied forces of Wessex and Mercia: the Danes in the Midlands, and the Norse who sailed from Ireland and established a kingdom in York. By the decade\u2019s end, Scandinavian rule in Northumbria had become client rulership. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (ASC) recorded that the Scandinavian forces were defeated, that Edward the Elder reigned over a newly combined realm as king from 919, and that his son \u00c6thelstan succeeded in 924.[CITATION-79] Contemporary accounts gave varied prominence to the leaders of Wessex and Mercia, and in particular to questions of overlordship and independent rule in Mercia.The Mercian Register (or \u2018Annals of \u00c6thelflaed\u2019, both terms coined by Charles Plummer for a Mercian-oriented part of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle) spans the years numbered 902 to 926. It covers in most detail the period from 909 to 919 and, as Pauline Stafford has noted, has the longest, most sustained discussion of women in the Chronicle.[CITATION-80] Stafford argues that these annals were conceived of in Mercia, very probably at the Mercian court of Worcester, in the early tenth century, as a continuation of the Alfredian Chronicle written in Wessex.[CITATION-81] The Mercian Register survives in three ASC manuscripts (B, C and D). Mercia had resisted overlordship, including that of Oswiu of Northumbria in the seventh century and Egbert of Wessex in the ninth; and there is evidence that the Mercian Register was actively suppressed in tenth-century Wessex.[CITATION-82] In this Mercian chronicle, \u00c6thelflaed built and restored strategic border fortresses on both fronts, won allies and offered support in the north.[CITATION-83] By 918, Danish forces in Leicester had submitted to \u00c6thelflaed,[CITATION-84] and she won York\u2019s submission shortly before her death at Tamworth in 918. Edward the Elder, otherwise almost entirely absent from these annals, seized Mercia from \u00c6lfwynn, \u00c6thelflaed and \u00c6thelred\u2019s daughter, in 919.[CITATION-85] Stafford has observed that these annals extend beyond \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s death, which could indicate that the motive for writing or continuing this narrative was to contend that \u00c6lfwynn had been wrongly deprived and to assert her legitimacy.[CITATION-86] The annals may have seemed to harbour, beyond the deeds of one great ruler, an ember of an argument for Mercian resistance.The West Saxon annals tell a different story. The earliest extant version, surviving in ASC MS A, shows the commanding figure of Edward the Elder leading the allied armies of Mercia and Wessex, capturing the Danish border towns of Hertford, Bedford and Buckingham in 912, 914 and 915.[CITATION-87] The A annals and Ealdorman \u00c6thelweard\u2019s chronicle refer to \u00c6thelflaed only as \u2018the king\u2019s sister\u2019 on her death, and only the A annals refer to her rule of Mercia\u2014in the past tense.[CITATION-88] Wessex had no comparable cases of political power wielded by women. Asser credited Alfred\u2019s mother with inspiring his education,[CITATION-89] but claimed that Offa of Mercia\u2019s daughter Eadburh may have poisoned her husband King Beorhtric of Wessex, and that thenceforth the king\u2019s wife would not be called queen.[CITATION-90] Before the mid-tenth century, a consort in Wessex was the \u2018king\u2019s wife\u2019, with limited influence; consorts in Mercia wielded more power, for instance by witnessing charters.[CITATION-91] In the twelfth century, the history of early tenth-century Anglo-Saxon kingdoms depended upon one\u2019s information and vantage point. Perhaps in response, the ASC D scribes in the eleventh and twelfth centuries rewrote earlier annals, bringing together histories of these different Anglo-Saxon kingdoms\u2014and they preserved stories of English and Scottish \u2018survivors\u2019 of the Norman Conquest in 1066, as well as its Norman victors.[CITATION-92] William, John, Henry and Aelred all knew the Mercian Register\u2019s version of early tenth-century events. William and John knew both Mercian and West Saxon versions; Henry knew only the Mercian version; and Aelred knew Henry\u2019s. For these Latin writers, the Mercian vision of history was worth remembering\u2014and more: it was historically significant.The circumstances of a ruler\u2019s birth\u2014whether foreign origin, ignoble birth, or being born female\u2014mattered less to these historians than what a ruler made of those circumstances and how he or she ruled. The clearest statement of this philosophy is found in William\u2019s account of King \u00c6thelstan in his. Addressing \u00c6thelstan directly, he stated:Adeo prestat ex te quam ex maioribus habere quo polleas, quia illud tuum, istud reputabitur alienum.[CITATION-93] It is far more outstanding that you should excel through that which comes from you, rather than from your ancestors, because the former will be considered yours; the latter, another\u2019s.William sustained this view in. He had a personal reason to admire \u00c6thelstan\u2019s deeds: the king, he reported proudly, gave pieces of the Cross to Malmesbury Abbey that actively sustained the abbey.[CITATION-94] He surpassed \u2018all his predecessors\u2019 () \u2018in spiritual devotion\u2019 () and his victories obscured theirs in splendour.[CITATION-95] His policies worked: he defeated treachery and exacted effective tribute payment from the Danes\u2014and for all this, he merited a celebratory ode.[CITATION-96] William noted the rumour that \u00c6thelstan was a concubine\u2019s son, and that it was used to dispute the king\u2019s legitimacy. William doubted its truth, and more importantly, its relevance. \u00c6thelstan, he observed, \u2018[had] nothing ignoble about him\u2019 ().[CITATION-97] That William I was born out of wedlock was equally irrelevant: William of Malmesbury stressed the enduring love between Duke Robert and Herleva, and Herleva\u2019s dream of her son\u2019s \u2018future greatness\u2019 ().[CITATION-98] \u00c6thelstan was remarkable for making himself sole ruler of England\u2014and a surpassingly impressive one\u2014neither because nor in spite of his birth. He achieved independent rule through action, sustaining hope and retaining loyalty: \u2018\u00c6thelstan, lest he disappoint the people\u2019s hope and diminish their esteem of him, subjugated all England entirely to the terror of his name alone\u2019 ().[CITATION-99] This was not pre-determined: it happened because of a forward-thinking ruler. William reiterated the importance of others\u2019 regard in explaining that \u00c6thelstan came to rule Northumbria\u2014the final kingdom to fall under his sway\u2014by the \u2018coincid[ing] of ancient right and new relationship\u2019 ()\u2014that is, the marriage alliance between \u00c6thelstan\u2019s sister and Sihtric, ruler of the Northumbrians.[CITATION-100] Northumbria was but the capstone of \u00c6thelstan\u2019s larger strategy of fulfilling the obligations of relationships with his citizens, neighbours and successors. According to William, he achieved rule of all England by this strategy. Precedent helped, but was not sufficient to make him king; and, ultimately, William deemed it less important. This is significant, because it means that William was highly sceptical of two things: first, a deterministic vision of history; second, the relevance and value of circumstance rather than action. In his eyes, the history of rulership of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms was not primarily grounded in continuous tradition. Rather, it was formed by the decisions and new relationships of its rulers.William claimed that he found relatively little of interest in the history of Mercia,[CITATION-101] and thought the kingdom barely worthy of record after Ceolwulf II (d..879). He thought Mercia had \u2018flourished\u2019 () suddenly under the rule of the overconfident pagan Uhtred, but \u2018decayed\u2019 () under the rule of Ceolwulf II(\u2018of a king only half-man\u2019), and so was seized by Alfred.[CITATION-102] Like the author of, William used gendered language here to criticise bad leadership. But \u00c6thelflaed had all the qualities he deemed excellent in a ruler:non pretermittatur soror regis Ethelfleda Etheredi relicta, non mediocre momentum partium, fauor ciuium, pauor hostium,[CITATION-103] immodici cordis femina \u2026 Virago potentissima multum fratrem consiliis iuuare, in urbibus extruendis non minus ualere \u2026[CITATION-104] we must not overlook the king\u2019s sister \u00c6thelflaed, \u00c6thelred\u2019s widow, of no small influence among those on her side, popular with her subjects and a terror to the enemy, a woman of spirit beyond measure \u2026 The most powerful virago greatly aided her brother in counsel, no less influential in building cities \u2026She was effective, persuasive and influential in leading war, in advising her brother Edward the Elder, and in building cities and the support of allies. In one version of, William claimed that she took the decision to maintain chastity after the birth of her daughter\u2014not for spiritual reasons, but because of complications with the birth of her first child and the affront this had presented to the dignity of a king\u2019s daughter.[CITATION-105] William stressed her role as paternal aunt () who, with her husband the ealdorman, raised and educated the future king \u00c6thelstan with great zeal ().[CITATION-106] William held that a combination of luck and character were the reasons for her successes. \u2018You cannot discern,\u2019 he wrote in direct address, \u2018whether luck or character were more important in enabling the woman to protect her own men and to terrify outsiders\u2019 ().[CITATION-107] He was certain that both factors were present. Her successes were entirely to her own credit, as the active verbs underline. Neither Providence nor her dynastic connection to the House of Wessex explained her remarkable abilities. For William, deterministic factors never sufficed to account for any ruler\u2019s successes or failures.[CITATION-108] Here, the interpretative quality of translation is important to note, because translating a Latin noun\u2014here,\u2014into English requires an indefinite or definite article, which in turn requires making a choice between the universal and the particular, respectively. Did William mean to imply that it is remarkable that \u2018a woman\u2019 (any woman at all) is successful, thus making a universal claim about women? Or did he mean that it is simply not obvious which factor made more of a difference in the success of \u2018the woman\u2019 (the woman he has just been writing about) in this particular case? The latter reading bears no implicit judgement that women were inherently less capable of protecting their men and terrifying foreigners, even if they were situated to do so less often. The only way to resolve this question is to establish if there is evidence in William\u2019s works for which view he held.It turns out there is. William did not find it unusual for a woman to wield power, nor remarkable that she should wield it well. The wordis susceptible to an etymological fallacy: that, because it derives from the root for man, it means \u2018manlike woman\u2019,[CITATION-109] rather than \u2018woman\u2019 (as in Genesis 2:23) or \u2018strong woman\u2019 (as for William). In English, for example, the word \u2018woman\u2019 derives from the root \u2018wife of man\u2019, but that is not its meaning: the terms are not synonyms. The best gauge of a word\u2019s meaning is its use, not its derivation. This distinction is also present in Isidore of Seville\u2019s early seventh-century. Isidore traced\u2019s etymology to a root through, and originating prior to, gender:back to(\u2018man\u2019, of whichwas an ancient form for \u2018woman\u2019), andin turn back to(\u2018strength\u2019). He distinguished between\u2019s derivation (a woman who acts in a manly way) and its meaning in use: it was a word used for strong women, or for women who perform a man\u2019s deeds.[CITATION-110] William usedalongsidefor \u00c6thelflaed, thus acknowledging that she was a woman, and a formidable one. His consistency in this use, and the positive import of the word, are evident from the contexts in which he used it: for \u00c6thelflaed, for praising Adela, daughter of William I, whom he honoured as a \u2018strong woman commended for earthly power\u2019 ()[CITATION-111] and who helped to secure Normandy for William Adelin,[CITATION-112] and for Matilda\u2019s just cause: \u2018the strong woman came to England to assert her right against Stephen\u2019 ().[CITATION-113] Unlike Hugh the Chanter, who used(\u2018masculine strong woman\u2019) for Adela, William did not usein conjunction with language for gendered behaviour.[CITATION-114] William ascribed strength to these women without qualifying that strength as masculine.[CITATION-115] Still more crucially, William did not view strong women only in comparison with other strong women. He implicitly compared \u00c6thelflaed with three ancient leaders\u2014Alexander the Great and his parents, Philip of Macedon and Olympias\u2014in borrowing language from Justin\u2019sof Pompeius Trogus\u2019s. According to Justin\u2019s account, strategic discussions about the war in Greece highlighted the value of Olympias\u2019s critical support and Alexander and Philip\u2019s influence among the people:Quibusdam placebat bellum in Macedoniam transferri, ad ipsum fontem et caput regni, ubi et Olympias esset, mater Alexandri,: sed in rem visum est ab Aegypto incipere, ne in Macedoniam profectis Asia a Ptolemaeo occuparetur.[CITATION-116] It was pleasing to some that the war should be transferred to Macedonia, to the very head and metropolis of the kingdom, where Alexander\u2019s mother Olympias was, who would be no small support to their party; while the favour of their countrymen would be with them because of the names of Alexander and Philip; but it seemed more to the purpose to begin with Egypt, lest, while they were gone into Macedonia, Asia should be seized by Ptolemy.Rodney Thomson has noted William\u2019s allusion to Olympias, observing that Justin\u2019s words () meant that Olympias\u2019s participation would make a significant contribution to those whom she supported.[CITATION-117] But William\u2019s characterisation of \u00c6thelflaed also alluded to the male emperors. Thomson, readingfor Justin\u2019s, thought that Justin\u2019sapplied to Olympias,[CITATION-118] where in fact Justin credited it to Alexander and Philip. William appropriated both Olympias\u2019s tide-turning influence () and Alexander and Philip\u2019s command of the citizens\u2019 favour () for \u00c6thelflaed: he viewed the qualities of eminent, imperial, ancient men and women who ruled well as qualities also possessed by \u00c6thelflaed, without reference to her sex or theirs.William was not alone in this regard. Henry normally abbreviated the material he drew from his sources for Anglo-Saxon history (primarily Bede and ASC),[CITATION-119] but for cases of exceptional glory, he added to it. Of all rulers of the English people in his mammoth, \u00c6thelflaed (twice) and William I (once) were the only two whom Henry both compared with and found superior to Caesar:Victrix natur[a]e, nomine digna uiri:/ Te, quo splendidior fieres, natura puellam,/ Te probitas fecit nomen habere uiri./ Te mutare decet, sed solam, nomina sexus,/ Tu regina potens rexque trophea parans./ Iam nec Cesarei tantum meruere triumphi,/ Cesare splendidior, uirgo uirago uale.[CITATION-120] Conqueror of nature, worthy of the name of a man: you were made a girl by nature, so that you were the more illustrious; your prowess made you have the name of a man. For you, but you alone, it is fitting to change the name of your sex; you a mighty queen and a king earning victories. Even the triumphs of Caesar did not gain so much. Virgin strong woman, more illustrious than Caesar, farewell.Willelmus omnium predictorum summus xxi anno glorifice splenduit. De quo dictum est:/ Cesariem Cesar tibi se natura negauit,/ Hanc Willelme tibi stella comata dedit.[CITATION-121] William, higher than all preceding, shone gloriously until his twenty-first year. Of whom it was said:/ If nature denied you, Caesar, luxuriant hair,/ The long-haired star, William, gave it to you.Not all rulers of the English whom Henry considered conquerors earned such high praise or marks of distinction. In Wessex, Ine defeated Geraint of the Welsh and the south Saxons, then gave up rulership \u2018happily\u2019 (), Cuthred conquered the Britons twice, Ecgbehrt retained the kingdom he conquered (),[CITATION-122] \u00c6thelwulf \u2018conquered\u2019 () the Danes at, and Eadred (brother of Edmund) \u2018obtained all parts of England happily\u2019 ();[CITATION-123] none, apparently, did so exceptionally. What kind of conqueror, then, merited terms such as illustrious and glorious, and superlatives about quality of rulership?In Henry\u2019s view, distinctive, outstanding or illustrious rule had to demonstrate unvanquished excellence in one of two ways: on the offensive in the conquest of formidable enemies, or in personal piety. First, excellence in battle. \u00c6thelbald the Proud () of Mercia was eminent in conquest, but not glorious: he ravaged Northumbria, \u2018conquered the Welsh people\u2019 () and \u2018was chief among the kings of England\u2019 (), but was conquered by Cuthred of Wessex and killed.[CITATION-124] Edward the Elder of Wessex, however, did earn glory\u2014not for conquering, but for excelling in conquest, and overcoming the strongest of enemies. He fought the Danes on multiple fronts: first in Northumbria, and then in Mercia, where he \u2018vanquished them gloriously and killed strong kings\u2019 (), before he defeated them at Tettenhall and \u2018conquered Mercia\u2019 ().[CITATION-125] For some conquerors\u2019 victories, the ruler did not merit exclusive personal credit. If it was not clear that a ruler had acted alone, eminence yielded no superlatives. For King Alfred\u2019s victory in 894, \u2018Omnipotent God gave them victory at the opportune moment\u2019 ().[CITATION-126] At the Battle of Tettenhall in 910 the Lord \u2018destroyed the infidels in a great crushing defeat\u2019 ()[CITATION-127] on Edward the Elder\u2019s behalf (a victory Henry credited to Edward directly in his summary),[CITATION-128] and Henry did not know who the victor was at the Battle of Holme.[CITATION-129] Without the West Saxon annals\u2019 evidence of human initiative and influence, Henry did not claim surpassing glory for these rulers.Second, excellence in personal piety. Eadberht of Northumbria, frail in life, became a monk and met \u2018with a glorious end\u2019 ().[CITATION-130] \u00c6thelred of Mercia, son of Penda, \u2018gloriously became a monk\u2019 ().[CITATION-131] King Edgar the Peaceable () of Wessex worked \u2018to pacify\u2019 () the people and reigned in the service of God. Although Henry tempered this praise, calling Edgar too generous to pagans and foreigners, he wrote that Edgar \u2018ruled with peace and greater glory than all others\u2019 (),[CITATION-132] and was thus worthy both of distinction and glory.What, then, of those rulers who earned distinction\u2014and illustriousness or glory\u2014in conquests both of body and spirit? Henry named \u00c6thelflaed queen and king because she appeared to rule exceptionally, alone, and in her own right. Because Henry lacked the West Saxon version of events for 914\u2013920 that told of Edward the Elder\u2019s reconquests,[CITATION-133] \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s victories would have appeared (from the Mercian Register) to have been almost single-handed. Her Wessex heritage played no part in his encomium: he did not know \u00c6thelflaed was Alfred\u2019s daughter, probably thinking her \u00c6thelred of Mercia\u2019s daughter, not his wife.[CITATION-134] Henry twice observed that \u00c6thelred was ill, that \u00c6thelflaed \u2018was reigning under him in his infirmity\u2019 (), and that he gave her Mercia (\u2018his land\u2019,) after his death because he had no son.[CITATION-135] Henry recognised her experience in ruling and that \u00c6thelred appointed her because the times required her leadership.Henry cited \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s high degree of military prowess (\u2018of such worth\u2019,), thus crediting the view that she promised to be a surpassingly excellent ruler: \u2018it was thought and said\u2019 () that had she not been seized by fate before her time (), \u2018she would have surpassed all men in valour\u2019 ().[CITATION-136] Cnut of Denmark, who conquered England in 1016, was \u2018greater than all his predecessors\u2019 and \u2018reigned gloriously\u2019 (); the conqueror William I, likewise, was the highest of all those previously named, and shone with glory ().[CITATION-137] \u00c6thelflaed embodied ideal rulership in overcoming odds. To Henry, the nature of the odds faced by a ruler mattered less than the degree and scale of success they achieved. For example, \u00c6thelstan was an imperial leader and victor over the strongest of forces; and for this reason Henry expanded on ASC 934 rather than contracting it. \u00c6thelstan shone () unconquered (). He \u2018could never be conquered in war\u2019 () and merited terms redolent of Roman eternal victory: he \u2018returned\u2019 from battle with the \u2018triumphal laurel\u2019 ().[CITATION-138] For Henry, these deeds were not enough to merit poetry[CITATION-139] or the honour of a comparison to Caesar. \u00c6thelflaed, by contrast, was also a \u2018conqueror of nature\u2019 ()\u2014meaning natural condition: in this case, being born a girl ()\u2014for which reason she was more illustrious (). What this means is important: it was precisely because she was a woman that she could be more illustrious than other rulers. As a ruler compared with other rulers, she was distinctive because she conquered obstacles. In realising her capacity to be a conqueror, she deserved a conqueror\u2019s glory.What \u00c6thelflaed, Cnut and William I had in common was that they distinguished themselves in rulership not just because they won victories over the enemy, but because they won even greater victories over themselves. Bede, Henry\u2019s source and model, also admired conquering rulers,[CITATION-140] but Henry went further in dramatising their personal dominion and inner victories. Cnut had an epiphany of humility when he realised he could not command the waves, and experienced compunction when receiving the news of a massacre of hostages at Sandwich.[CITATION-141] Henry wrote of William I becoming markedly less violent once he became king, claiming that he achieved concord in England after the Conquest and was \u2018exceptionally powerful\u2019 () in administrating the 1086 Domesday survey.[CITATION-142] In remaining a virgin (Henry believed), winning battles and ruling a kingdom first in practice and then in name, \u00c6thelflaed defeated physical desire and the challenges of her natural condition. Henry was no feminist: in the style of contemporary Latin poets, he praised her strength in showing manly virtue.[CITATION-143] Rather than viewing as liabilities such conditions as being pagan, female, or a foreign conqueror, he viewed them as assets when they allowed for a more glorious sally toward a ruler\u2019s greatest strength.Aelred\u2019s concise genealogy of kings merits a brief mention here, for which Henry\u2019swas a source. Addressed to the future Henry II,[CITATION-144] related this ruler\u2019s illustrious heritage (male and female), including remarkable leaders of the English in his past.[CITATION-145] Aelred praised \u00c6thelflaed, though she was neither king nor progenitor of a royal line:Adjecit etiam decoris plurimum soror regis Aelfleda, sexu quidem femina, sed animo ac virtute plus viro, quae exceptis his quas rex aedificaverat urbes construxit, Brunesburch, Bruge, Scorgate, Thamewrthe, Swaford, Edebirath, Werewicum, Ciresbirith, Warebirich, Runconere, Liecestre. Ipsa pugnavit contra Walenses et vicit, et Derebi expugnavit et cepit. Tantaque fortitudine emicuit, ut a pluribus rex diceretur.[CITATION-146] The king\u2019s sister, \u00c6thelflaed, added a great deal of nobility. In sex she was a woman, but in spirit and strength more a man, who built cities, excepting those the king [Edward the Elder of Wessex] had erected,, Bridgnorth, Scorgate, Tamworth, Stafford, Eddisbury, Warwick, Chirbury, Warebury, Runcorn, Leicester. She herself fought the Welsh and bested them, and she stormed Derby and took it. She displayed such courage that many called her king.In affirming that \u00c6thelflaed was a woman perceived as, while in two qualities \u2018more\u2019 ()\u2014but not fully or exclusively\u2014a man, Aelred, like Henry, refrained from ascribing binary gender. The clue to \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s presence inis the first word,(\u2018added\u2019): she herself (\u2014an emphatic) increased the honour of English rulers. To augment a lineage required neither male birth nor being a parent of rulers, but independent action and success.John of Worcester engaged in a different enterprise: writing a new version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in Latin.[CITATION-147] His individual changes, though subtle, amount to a marked reframing of \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s autonomy and consummate quality as a ruler. As in ASC, \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s being female was not discussed. To cultivate an impressive English history, John rewrote ASC to accord rulers more agency and influence: he highlighted efficiency and successes rather than failures.[CITATION-148] All rulers were stronger in his account, but some were stronger than others.John\u2019s account of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the early tenth century, and the formation of the English kingdom, is a story less national than lordly in character. The English rulers of Mercia and Wessex protected their borders from foreign incursions, winning support from leaders of other realms. The achievements he highlighted in rulers of this era were lordship (leading followers), expansion, and duration of rule, especially when retained against threats. Edward the Elder, \u2018most invincible king of the English\u2019 (), \u2018most gloriously\u2019 () led \u2018all the inhabitants of Britain\u2019 (): English, Scots, Cumbrians, Danes and Welsh.[CITATION-149] John added details to \u00c6thelstan\u2019s reign to stress his imperial intentions and successes: after expelling Guthfrith and Ealdred (in ASC MSS E, F), \u00c6thelstan added Guthfrith\u2019s kingdom to his own dominion, then sought and made a \u2018firm treaty\u2019 (\u2026). \u00c6thelstan\u2019s epithet is \u2018vigorous and glorious king of the English\u2019 (),[CITATION-150] and John usedfor other rulers, including King Harold II.[CITATION-151] John thought that \u00c6thelflaed, compared to other rulers, excelled in military leadership, the length of her tenure, and autonomous rule. Responding to Scandinavian threats on multiple fronts, she commanded and gave effective orders before and during her formal rule of Mercia. John elaborated on the Mercian Register, already favourable to her accomplishments, by specifying that she had more personal autonomy, influence, divine favour, and quality as a leader. The Register explained that with God\u2019s help, \u00c6thelflaed built Tamworth and Stafford (913), captured Derby (917), and peacefully took control of Leicester with divine aid (918).[CITATION-152] Whereas for William and Henry, subduing or ignoring the element of divine intervention was a way to highlight a ruler\u2019s independence, John, unusually, retained this claim of divine support, which he did in theonly to highlight support for rightful causes.[CITATION-153] In rewriting \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s deeds in the Mercian Register, John increased her active leadership in caring for a British and Anglo-Saxon past and planning for the future. Asshe built four towns, erected two fortresses, and founded Eddisbury and Warwick\u2014foundations mentioned in the Mercian Register, but not attributed directly to her there.[CITATION-154] He newly attributed the restoration of Caerllion (his British name for Chester) to the joint command of Ealdorman \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelflaed (),[CITATION-155] thereby highlighting her part in joint rulership before she became. He claimed that she restored (), rather than built, Tamworth.[CITATION-156] In naming \u00c6thelflaed and her husband authors of urban restoration, including a pre-English city, John made them, in effect, custodians of the past.For John, \u00c6thelflaed illustrated the long history of influential, worthy rulers of the English. He made a significant intervention at the beginning of her reign: after her husband \u00c6thelred\u2019s death, \u2018\u00c6thelflaed, daughter of king Alfred, held the kingdom of the Mercians (except London and Oxford, which her brother King Edward the Elder retained) most vigorously, and for a considerable period of time\u2019 ().[CITATION-157] The Mercian Register mentioned neither the extent of her control, nor the length of her dominion, nor the vigour of her rule. Here, John made this Mercian ruler\u2019s accomplishments supersede even those of the praiseworthy, imperial ruler Edward the Elder, who is relegated to a subordinate clause.John expanded on, and added precision to, \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s military prowess and strategic thinking as a leader, asserting her autonomy and influence especially when she acted independently.[CITATION-158] She responded efficiently to heathen Danish raids: when they attacked, she gave hostages on the condition they will leave(\u2018as quickly as possible\u2019). While the Danes hid shamefully in their ships, she chose to stand and fight. She led a staunch defence against the heathens: John wrote that the Danes could only collect booty on their retreat, not during the siege, implying that the English forces were stronger. He turned the English killing of hundreds of Danes (as in the Mercian Register) into thousands, making the feat more impressive. \u00c6thelflaed sent an army () into Wales and took the fortress, taking the Welsh king\u2019s wife and thirty-four men to Mercia as captives.[CITATION-159] John credited \u00c6thelflaed personally with taking Derby \u2018by assault\u2019 (), also adding to the Mercian Register account that her army fought bravely. John highlighted \u00c6thelflaed and Edward\u2019s allied deeds of reconquest on behalf of the \u2018many English\u2019 () and \u2018all the country people\u2019 () living under pagan rule. In the Mercian Register the people survived; here, they survived rejoicing () at their escape.[CITATION-160] The Mercian Register recorded the events, but the scale of success and leadership is stronger in John\u2019s chronicle.In a notable change, John cast \u00c6thelflaed as a ruler who established dominion over other rulers. In this he was original. The formality and prestige of this arrangement is stronger than in the Mercian Register, wherein the people of York () promise to be under her rule: \u20187 h\u00e6fdon eac Eforwicingas hire gehaten, 7 sume on wedde geseald, sume mid a\u00feum gef\u00e6stnod, \u00fe\u00e6t hi on hyre r\u00e6denne beon woldon\u2019 (\u2018And also the people of York had promised her, and some granting by pledge, some with oaths, that they would be guided by her rule\u2019).[CITATION-161] In John\u2019s version, however, she accepts the full and complete submission of the Danes who ruled () in York: \u2018the Danes who ruled York affirmed, some by treaty, some by oath, that they would assent to her will and judgement in all things\u2019 ().[CITATION-162] Neither the Scandinavians nor their governing of York appear in the Mercian Register. Thus, in the, \u00c6thelflaed accepts not the submission of people, but the submission of rulers, themselves conquerors and foreigners. That the Danes submit to \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s will in all things shows their submission is complete and unconditional, a totality of victory that is new in John\u2019s version. John created an impression of a strong royal will in stressing her capacity as ruler of Mercia and overlord of the Danish rulers of York.[CITATION-163] In his verdict on \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s rule, John adapted material from the Mercian Register[CITATION-164] and introduced eulogistic praise:\u00c6gelfleda Merciorum domina insignis prudentie et iustitie, uirtutisque eximie femina, .viii. anno ex quo sola regnum Merciorum strenuo iustoque rexit moderamine, .xix. kalend Iul. obiit, et unicam filiam suam Aewynnam ex Aetheredo subregulo susceptam, heredem regni reliquit.[CITATION-165] \u00c6thelflaed, lord of the Mercians, distinguished by her prudence and justice, a woman of outstanding virtue, in the eighth year after which she began to rule on her own the kingdom of the Mercians with vigorous and just government, died on the nineteenth day before the calends of July, leaving \u00c6lfwynn, her only daughter by \u00c6thelred, the underking, as heiress to her kingdom.Her burial with honour shows that her contemporaries recognised the quality of her rule. In specifying that \u00c6thelflaed provided for the succession for \u00c6lfwynn, he gave her agency over the succession.[CITATION-166] He wrote that \u00c6thelflaed ruled alone) to make her independence unambiguous.\u00c6thelflaed emerges on par with other tenth-century rulers of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, as John\u2019s changes to earlier accounts show. John assumed no male dominance in cases of joint rule. He increased the parity between \u00c6thelflaed and her husband \u00c6thelred in decision-making, and between \u00c6thelflaed and Edward in military endeavours. She ruled as lord and overlord: she led her followers in her own name and secured the submission of other rulers, as Edward and \u00c6thelstan did; her rule endured a long time, like \u00c6thelstan\u2019s treaty. In other ways, she exceeded them. Edward and \u00c6thelstan were strong, glorious, successful, but John did not single them out for their military prowess: where they were, only \u00c6thelflaed merited the superlative, in acting. She shared with her contemporaries the key quality of overlordship of other rulers, whereas prudence, justice, virtue, effecting restoration, and surpassing military strength were qualities particular to her. There are two related implications of John\u2019s views. First, gender was irrelevant. Second, a person who ruled a larger kingdom (such as England versus an Anglo-Saxon kingdom), or one with more sub-rulers (such as Wessex compared to Mercia), did not necessarily rule with greater distinction. What interested John was the quality of rulership relative to the scale of the kingdom and its unique challenges. In this regard, \u00c6thelflaed merited parity with, and distinction among, other rulers of the English.William, Henry, John and Aelred, with different historical sources and perspectives, highlighted \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s autonomy and lordship to a greater degree than their sources. They thought \u00c6thelflaed an excellent ruler, and cited her honour and reputation among her contemporaries. They signalled her distinction and overlordship with superlatives, exactly as Bede had done to distinguish rulers who reigned over an(a realm of more than one kingdom or people) rather than a(one kingdom), and classical writers before him.[CITATION-167] They compared \u00c6thelflaed with other rulers on the basis of action and achievement.In their narratives, ruling well depended on human capacity and a proven ability to command, and gendered thought cannot account for their judgements. There is no evidence that twelfth-century English writers imagined a link between \u00c6thelflaed and Matilda. They did not compare them with each other, nor with women as an abstract category. \u00c6thelflaed had ruled the Mercians for years before her election; Matilda, before her father\u2019s death, had mostly lived abroad. William thought Matilda strong for asserting her right ();[CITATION-168] \u00c6thelflaed wielded authority unexpectedly, but well. Henry supported Matilda\u2019s right, but claimed that for \u00c6thelflaed, and only \u00c6thelflaed, should the name of her sex be changed. John and the Gloucester continuator\u2019scriticised both Stephen and Matilda at times; John uniformly endorsed \u00c6thelflaed.[CITATION-169] \u00c6thelflaed and Matilda offered two otherwise unrelated examples of strong rulers, one of whom, writers agreed, ruled exceptionally well.It has been claimed that women in the Anglo-Norman world could only wield power \u2018as men\u2019;[CITATION-170] or, on the other hand, that political opponents condemned women who acted in a masculine manner.[CITATION-171] The flaw in these conclusions is the assumption that, because female rule was rare and unprecedented, binary gender dominated the language of leadership. This was not the case. Some writers used gendered language for the behaviour of women and men: William\u2019s bad Mercian king was;made partisan slurs about both sexes; Aelred named \u00c6thelflaed more man than woman. These examples suggest that behaving in a \u2018manly\u2019 way was seen as virtuous, but it was not the only, nor the best, way to excel.In these historians\u2019 views of any ruler, being female was not an inherent handicap, nor a diminishing quality, nor a valid reason to compare her only with other women. David Carpenter discussed Matilda\u2019s claim in the context of, and in comparison with, female rulers, including continental consorts and the biblical queen Judith.[CITATION-172] Contemporaries did not. T. Gregory Foster, similarly, wrote in 1892 of \u00c6thelflaed as a new Judith.[CITATION-173] Neither the Mercian Register nor twelfth-century writers invoked Judith or queens consort as comparisons for \u00c6thelflaed. They invoked emperors, conquerors, leaders. Henry framed being born a girl as an opportunity for success. Like being pagan, ignobly born, or foreign, it was one possible condition for earning surpassing glory. \u00c6thelflaed outdid other rulers in the same way as other conquerors of realm and self. Henry proposed changing the name of \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s sex. He did not, however, make her gender binary. In naming her \u2018queen and king\u2019 (), Henry articulated the idea that a person could simultaneously hold a woman\u2019s role and a man\u2019s role, and merit praise for that very reason. For these writers, no circumstance of birth\u2014for \u00c6thelflaed, for \u00c6thelstan, for Caesar\u2014could diminish a ruler\u2019s inborn, equal capacity for glorious rule.For rulers past, present and prospective, writers thought that the stakes of rulership were related to action. There are parallels with other northern societies that were long connected with the English kingdoms through invasion and settlement. Carol J. Clover has argued that in early medieval Scandinavia, personality, ambition and social relations mattered more for an individual\u2019s status than \u2018bodily sex\u2019. Fears for both men and women concerned impotence and lack of power. To win much-desired \u2018distinction\u2019, they needed to act, and act again.[CITATION-174] Our writers would have been aware that succession customs favoured male heirs. Western post-Roman ruling dynasties such as the Merovingians and Carolingians had no reigning women. Rulership contingent on election and leadership, with opportunities created but not guaranteed by patrilineal succession, was widespread, not least in the Saxon dukes\u2019 bids for power and the rise of the Ottonians in the tenth century.[CITATION-175] In 919, Henry, duke of Saxony, was elected king of Germany by Franconian and Saxon princes and led a coalition of duchies against foreign invasions.[CITATION-176] Similarly, in terms of her election and leadership, \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s rule of Mercia was not unusual by early medieval standards. Matilda did not alert twelfth-century writers to a powerful woman: history alerted them to a powerful ruler, and comparative thinking alerted them to similarities among rulers who conquered odds and stimulated them to establish \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s lordship, overlordship and merit.These chroniclers\u2019 narratives of tenth-century Anglo-Saxon rulership have broader implications for their view of history. They knew rulers faced the threat of conquest, whether by Scandinavian invader or West Saxon ally, and admired excellent leadership in a perilous historical era. They also knew the outcomes. Yet each thought a peerless ruler\u2014one not moulded by circumstance\u2014was a person who exerted a turning force on events that might have turned out otherwise. Because they maintained that both Mercia and Wessex had rulers who exercised this leadership of moment, their view of history did not present \u2018England\u2019\u2014even Norman England\u2014as an inevitable conclusion.Twelfth-century Latin writers\u2019 views of \u2018the Anglo-Saxon past\u2019 have been presented on a spectrum running between two extremes: on one end, as a product of post-Conquest nostalgia[CITATION-177] or revival of \u2018the\u2019 English nation and English identity;[CITATION-178] on the other, as proprietary, colonial voices of an Anglo-Norman elite imposing a new \u2018Englishness\u2019 and seeking to \u2018write the English out of their own history\u2019.[CITATION-179] Recent work on what \u2018the Anglo-Saxon past\u2019 looked like from the twelfth century has stressed that writers perceived continuity across the Norman Conquest.[CITATION-180] This formula implies a unity,[CITATION-181] both in historical thinking and in the subject-matter of history, that is not supported by the evidence.The residue of different possible histories persisted in the different pictures of Anglo-Saxon history preserved in twelfth-century chronicles. Monastic writers rewrote their own pre-Conquest histories, in charters and local histories as well as annals and.[CITATION-182] Even in the mid-twelfth century, history looked very different from Canterbury than it did from Worcester, or Huntingdon.[CITATION-183] From Henry\u2019s perspective, where the West Saxon historical record for the tenth century was obscure, tenth-century Mercian rulership appeared distinguished: in Alfred\u2019s and Edward\u2019s wars, God punished the invaders; in \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s wars (and England\u2019s eleventh-century conquests), rulers defended and invaders punished themselves. But the bilingual Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (MS F) of Canterbury (closely related to Peterborough\u2019s MS E) did not name \u00c6thelflaed, though its author knew her as Edward\u2019s sister, and tenth-century Mercia vanished almost entirely in a story that looked like a West Saxon conquest of Britain.[CITATION-184] \u2018The Anglo-Saxon past\u2019 did not exist in the twelfth century: English pasts, however, did.The Anglo-Norman writers offered clear pictures of the distinct polities in England\u2019s tenth-century past and their leaders, wherein each kingdom\u2019s autonomy, rather than a gradual process of agglomeration to \u2018England\u2019 with West Saxon origins, remained a guiding theme. For these chroniclers, \u00c6thelflaed was noteworthy because she ruled well, and ruled Mercia well. Her importance to them was not any role in \u2018the creation of a unified English kingdom\u2019, as Theresa Earenfight has argued of Henry of Huntingdon.[CITATION-185] Henry never associated \u00c6thelflaed with unity. John and his team wrote at Worcester, where Alfred\u2019s Wessex court had lingering links, and whence the Mercian annals, contested by the Wessex chronicle tradition, probably sprang.[CITATION-186] John\u2019s changes to the \u00c6thelflaed narrative did not anticipate a unified future: they recalled leaders\u2019 deeds undertaken to preserve the past, to defend the present, and to build for their kingdom\u2019s future. His assertion that \u00c6thelflaed chose \u00c6lfwynn as her successor\u2014more explicit than his sources\u2014hardly sets up Edward the Elder\u2019s subsequent conquest of Mercia honourably. Even in praising Edward\u2019s imperial victories, John was unwilling to suppress the Mercians\u2019 interest in self-determination, though it did not last long beyond \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s death. Nor was \u00c6thelflaed a cog in any onward-pressing machine of unity for William of Malmesbury. William admired the peaceful impulse of a treaty that divided England into the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex, once again, as late as 1016: he praised Edmund Ironside for accepting Cnut\u2019s proposal that Edmund rule Mercia, and Cnut Wessex.[CITATION-187] William believed that Edmund was murdered shortly thereafter, and that this was cause for regret and grief, not relief that England was reunited.These Latin chroniclers were not obedient mouthpieces of an Anglo-Norman elite,[CITATION-188] but bilingual historians\u2014each with a particular outlook on the past\u2014who were interested in rulers past and present, in what they did and what people thought of them, and in communicating it in writing. They made their knowledge of Mercian rulership available in another language. They did not suppress Mercian history to serve a West Saxon agenda: they rescued it from the prospect of oblivion. At times they ranked the glory of a Mercian ruler higher than that of rulers of Wessex, Norman England, or the Roman Empire.Their story of Anglo-Saxon rulers was pragmatic rather than dynastic, which reflected historic and recent experience. In the eleventh century, Cnut, Harold Godwineson, and William I (who asserted his claim to the English throne through kinship with Emma of Normandy) did not inherit from their fathers; in the twelfth, King Stephen (William I\u2019s grandson) claimed the throne through his mother, Adela of Blois. No law governed English succession before or after the Conquest: an interplay of factors, and the weight of several successes, made some (like coronation) more significant over time.[CITATION-189] \u00c6thelflaed, ruling Mercia through marriage and election, was no aberration. Chroniclers considered her among the best of rulers, and not because she was Alfred\u2019s daughter. They thought less in terms of nostalgia and genealogy (thinking back), and more in terms of the substance a great ruler added\u2014as Aelred stated explicitly of \u00c6thelflaed\u2014to the story (thinking forwards).Their Anglo-Saxon histories highlighted the dynamic of changing relations between distinct polities. As William and John knew, \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s rule of Mercia originated in leadership experience and a relationship forged between two kingdoms. Under \u00c6thelstan, according to William, England formed as a result of ancient right and new relationships, with West Saxon, Mercian, and Scandinavian ruling families. Mercia became a strong defensive ally of Wessex, and Northumbria a part of England, as much through right as through the actions of tenth-century people. There is a strong sense of contingency here. The idea that chroniclers saw \u2018continuity\u2019 as a characteristic of the past partly obscures their sense of history happening through rulers\u2019 independent actions. And, for William, merit, not inheritance, made a person worthy of memory.Their thinking allowed for both shared and specific challenges. Tenth- and twelfth-century rulers alike asserted lordship and sought loyalty. Writers perceived that the independence and overlordship of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms changed during the Wessex\u2013Mercia alliance and reconquests of kingdoms from Scandinavian rulers. Similarly, in twelfth-century England and Normandy, landholders faced conflicting obligations because of the dynamic relationship between the two realms: separate under William Rufus and Robert Curthose, joined under Henry I, and separated again when Stephen lost Normandy to Geoffrey of Anjou in 1144. Writers thought a ruler\u2019s priorities were to lead, to manage, to provide, to excel; a leader\u2019s response made the measure of her, or his, success, and they framed their narratives accordingly.These writers told of great deeds done,, and not of national progress. Deeds did not become more impressive with time, nor with a bigger England. Absolute values\u2014sum of victories, size of conquest, sweep of realm\u2014were no part of their historical thought. The mark of sophistication in their historical reasoning, and comparative thinking, is that they assessed the degree of a ruler\u2019s achievement relative to its historical moment, and evaluated a ruler against her or his own obstacles.What explains the thinking of these writers, at this moment? The situation of women in their own present was of limited relevance. Neither the inheritance of heiresses, nor Matilda\u2019s candidacy for the crown, illuminate their comparative thought about \u00c6thelflaed. What is compelling is their historical inheritance: the evidence. The case for \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s excellence as a ruler was there, in the Mercian Register. They knew it, and judged it true. Their knowledge of classical tales of deeds, their interest in them as success stories, their curiosity about rulers in English history, and the presence of different sources for the same events, combined to invite comparison. The materials were at hand; they wanted only an inquiring mind and a ready pen.What, ultimately, did our writers say about themselves and their own thinking? Where John and Aelred are silent, we must turn to the self-reflective William and Henry. William discussed his work with Matilda of Scotland, wife of Henry I, and claimed that discussions with her inspired and shaped the content of his.[CITATION-190] He wrote of her family, her ideas, her suggestions and her persistence, without ascribing her interest in his project to specifically female concerns. She appears as a person just as curious about history as William himself. Henry, reflecting as he often did on his own thinking and on the fleeting nature of earthly glory,[CITATION-191] advised that \u2018we wish\u2019 (\u2014here, expressing a collective effort) for true glory in heaven. He was musing on the deeds of forty-five emperors of Britain and Rome. We can all, he wrote, learn something valuable from their deeds and aspirations by comparison (; \u2018by comparison with them, we may figure out\u2019). The collective \u2018we\u2019 means people. Henry did not view himself writing as a man in the role of historian. In his own words,: \u2018I speak as a human\u2019.[CITATION-192] "

    "text": "This article re-examines the place of the Middle Ages in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century English culture. In doing so, it presents an argument about the interrelationship of landscape, history and English national identity. Emphasising the importance of the medieval past to mainstream constructions of Englishness, the article shows how this importance largely derived from the felt presence of the Middle Ages in the physical environment, in the landscape of England. Their history congealed in the fields, forests, hills, towns and villages of the present day, the Middle Ages were readily accessible through imaginative agency and possessed of vital contemporary meaning. Embodied experience of landscape offered Victorians and Edwardians compelling evidence of the long continuities of English national history, from Anglo-Saxon times onwards. In an increasingly democratic context, the medieval presence in the landscape was evidence of the continuity not only of the institutions of the realm, but of the English people themselves. Until at least the First World War, and perhaps beyond, the tangible heritage of the Middle Ages in the English landscape served as an important source of reassurance of the nation\u2019s endurance and progress, amid the transformations of modernity.The scholarly debate as to whether nations are ancient or modern shows no sign of abating.[CITATION-1] But whatever our views on this debate, no one denies that nations claim legitimacy from tracing their origins back to a distant past\u2014even if many would say such lineages are fabricated, the stuff of \u2018invented traditions\u2019.[CITATION-2] The Middle Ages in particular have often provided material for what Anthony D. Smith called the \u2018Golden Age\u2019 elements of these nationalist narratives.[CITATION-3] This was true in many European countries across the modern period, including the nations of the British Isles.[CITATION-4] Focused on England in particular, the present article emphasises the importance of the distant past, and specifically that of the Middle Ages, to mainstream expressions of modern Englishness. It argues that the nationalistic significance of the medieval past was largely derived from the felt presence of this past in the physical environment, in the landscape of England. After all, landscape, like history, has always played a central role in the construction of national identities: nations are territorial entities, existing in space as well as time. And in the case of England, the period between the arrival of the \u2018Anglo-Saxons\u2019 in the fifth century and the coming of the Reformation in the sixteenth was especially important in this connection. From the middle of the nineteenth century until at least the First World War, the medieval past was central to the territorialisation of English national memory and, by extension, to the construction of English national identity.[CITATION-5] In making this case, the present article builds on my 2018 book,.[CITATION-6] With that book, I sought to demonstrate the importance of landscape in sustaining the sense of connection with the past on which Englishness was founded. My quarry was the past generally in the landscape; I was more reticent about its chronological particularity: the Middle Ages were not a point of analytical focus. However, much of the history immanent in the English landscape was (and is) medieval in character. Using material not drawn upon in the book, what follows explores the significance of this to the construction of English national identity. My aim here is not to deny the nationalistic significance of other pasts and their landscapes\u2014narratives of nationhood rely on long continuities as well as \u2018Golden Ages\u2019, after all. But I do wish to demonstrate the hitherto under-appreciated role of landscapes of the specifically medieval past.Indeed, not just in relation to national identity but more generally, historians have been reluctant to examine the nineteenth-century interconnection of the Middle Ages and the physical environment\u2014the history which, to adapt the terminology of the social anthropologist Tim Ingold, was experienced as being \u2018congealed\u2019 in the landscape.[CITATION-7] Notwithstanding the work of historians of archaeology and antiquarianism (much of which has, in any case, been focused on the eighteenth and twentieth centuries),[CITATION-8] there has been limited appreciation of the wider cultural significance of the fact that, as Charles Dellheim put it some decades ago, \u2018medieval survivals \u2026 were a physical presence in the improving, industrialising society\u2019 of modern England, and that \u2018for most Victorians the sense of the past was a visual rather than a verbal faculty, cultivated in the landscape more often than in the library, shaped in direct encounter with material objects\u2019.[CITATION-9] Even Dellheim had less to say about this than might be expected, and he was never especially concerned with what it might tell us about national identity. In re-examining cultural interactions with the physical presence of the medieval past in the nineteenth-century landscape, this article offers a new reading. It suggests that the nationalist significance of the Middle Ages very largely derived from its felt immanence in the topography of the homeland.It is impossible to exaggerate the impact of the picturesque on English engagement with landscape. Instructed by William Gilpin, Richard Payne Knight, Uvedale Price and other exponents of this new way of seeing, and facilitated by wars that made travel abroad impracticable, tourists flocked to the Wye Valley, the New Forest, the Lake District and other locales where picturesque scenery might be appreciated.[CITATION-10] The endeavour was charged with patriotic purpose; this was about celebrating the English homeland (even, as in the case of the Wye, when it was to be found in Wales).[CITATION-11] Given its emphasis on irregularity of form, ruins played an important role in picturesque discourse. Many dated from the Middle Ages\u2014as in the case of Tintern Abbey, the fame of which was ensured by Gilpin\u2019s proselytising and Wordsworth\u2019s poetry.[CITATION-12] Castles, too, were valued elements of picturesque landscapes; like abbeys, they offered in their ruination pleasing sensations of melancholy. But the historical associations attached to these relics were less significant than their pictorial impact\u2014the extent to which they conformed to approved aesthetic criteria. Antiquity was no necessary determinant of picturesque effect. For this reason, Gilpin could admire the visual qualities of modern-day industry in the landscape, such as forges and mills, even when sited cheek-by-jowl with \u2018venerable vestiges of [the] past\u2019.[CITATION-13] For this reason, too, gentlemanly \u2018improvers\u2019 had little compunction in sweeping away the physical traces of the Middle Ages, anachronistically remodelling or incorporating them into new designs. Thus, medieval mottes became viewing platforms and bowling greens, ruins were \u2018enhanced\u2019, and deer parks were absorbed into artfully laid-out gardens and demesnes.[CITATION-14] Such practices reflected the still-persisting negative connotations of the Middle Ages; conjoined to the aesthetic appreciation of ruins was a reading of them as appropriately dilapidated emblems of the temporal and spiritual tyranny of pre-Reformation times, now happily overthrown.But if the picturesque originally promoted a sensibility that prioritised aesthetic effect over historical association, this did not last for long. Late eighteenth-century antiquaries stimulated interest in the Middle Ages through on-foot exploration of the countryside in search of physical traces of the past.[CITATION-15] Moreover, as Rosemary Sweet has shown, the urban histories written in this period assigned prominence to the medieval heritage of now often-burgeoning towns and cities, the better to establish the origins of their present-day vibrancy and so stake claims for national recognition.[CITATION-16] To these currents of historical inquiry was joined the related tide of Romanticism. Here, the influence of Walter Scott was crucial. Through his novels, ballad poetry and antiquarianism, Scott made the past live in the landscape as never before.[CITATION-17] In England as much as Scott\u2019s native Scotland, the picturesque was now invested with historical associations of a more agreeable kind, with romantic myth-history, with knightly feats of chivalry and valour. Perhaps the best-known expression of this sensibility was the enthusiasm for Gothic castles, an enthusiasm that extended from an admiration of existing medieval survivals to their reincarnation in the contemporary landscape.[CITATION-18] But the Scott-inspired historicisation of the picturesque enchanted the landscape more generally. Even places previously regarded as dreary or barbarous\u2014such as the wild moorlands of the Anglo-Scottish border\u2014could be overlaid with a patina of glamour derived from associations with a now rehabilitated medieval past, however fancifully imagined or mythologised.The revolution in historical imagination wrought by Scott was accompanied by a revolution in historical scholarship\u2014one which placed the medieval past centre stage. In this interpretation, the genesis of England\u2019s nineteenth-century greatness, and indeed of the constitution (typically seen as specifically English rather than British), could be traced to Anglo-Saxon times, to the folk-moots of the self-governing \u2018mark\u2019 or village community, even to the forests of ancient Germany.[CITATION-19] For some, this story shaded into a racial Teutonism, perhaps especially when combined with the long-standing view that 1066 marked the imposition of an alien \u2018Norman Yoke\u2019 of tyranny on a free people.[CITATION-20] But the key emphasis, particularly in the accounts of leading Victorian historians, was on continuity rather than caesurae, on the stately progress of the nation and its institutions from Anglo-Saxon origins to more glorious heights of power, prosperity and freedom.[CITATION-21] The cultural and intellectual significance of this historiography has attracted much comment. Typically conceptualised as \u2018Whig\u2019 or whiggish in its teleological progressivism, it has been seen as an important expression of what might be termed the \u2018constitutional Middle Ages\u2019.[CITATION-22] But recognition of the nationalist dimension of this body of historical writing has often been somewhat obscured by an emphasis on its political context, especially that of Victorian liberalism\u2014as is the case in John Burrow\u2019s, for example.[CITATION-23] Yet, as theorists of nations and nationalism have long recognised, a felt sense of continuity is a precondition of identity, national or otherwise;[CITATION-24] and these histories provided one source of this continuity so far as nineteenth-century England was concerned. They evidenced the nation\u2019s endurance through the vicissitudes of the past, offering reassurance of its continued endurance amid those of the present and future.Landscape was important to crafting such patriotic narratives. The organic development of the nation was read in the physical environment. That landscape could be interpreted historically may seem obvious, given the work of modern-day archaeologists, the scholars of theschool, or landscape historians in the tradition of W.G. Hoskins and Maurice Beresford. But the extent to which nineteenth-century historians engaged with the out-of-doors world has been insufficiently appreciated. Following the practice of their antiquarian forebears, many prominent mid-to-late Victorian historians\u2014E.A. Freeman, J.R. Green, F.W. Maitland, James Bryce, Mandell Creighton, to name but a few\u2014were prodigious in their on-foot exploration of the places featured in their histories.[CITATION-25] Such exploration was central to their historical practice, which to an extent anticipated Lucien Febvre, Fernand Braudel and otherin its conviction, as Green put it, that \u2018History strikes its roots in Geography; for without a clear and vivid realization of the physical structure of a country the incidents of the life which men have lived in it can have no interest or meaning\u2019.[CITATION-26] This was particularly true so far as their writing of medieval history was concerned. Himself convinced that geography was \u2018the foundation of history\u2019,[CITATION-27] Bryce recalled that when Freeman was working on the invasion of 1066, \u2018[h]e visited every spot upon which the Conqueror is recorded to have set his foot\u2019 and \u2018[w]hen writing upon Rufus\u2019, the ill-starred son and heir of William I, \u2018he spent some time in examining the afforested district of the New Forest, and sought for traces of the villages and churches said to have been depopulated or destroyed\u2019.[CITATION-28] Such purposive engagement with landscape found most imaginative expression in the work of Freeman\u2019s friend John Richard Green, whose(1874) was almost certainly the best-selling history of England until the appearance, seventy years later, of G.M. Trevelyan\u2019s equally place-sensitive.[CITATION-29] Green\u2019s magnum opus testifies to his reading of history through landscape. A visit to the Isle of Thanet in 1870, where he walked the coastline around Ebbsfleet, convinced him that this was where the Saxons first made landfall in 449. Quite apart from what themight say, it was clear from the lie of the land. \u2018Everything in the character of the spot\u2019, Green wrote, confirmed the truth of the story: where now lay the \u2018misty level of the present Minster Marsh\u2019 there had been \u2018a broad inlet of sea parting Thanet from the mainland\u2019, and it was down this channel that \u2018the pirate-boats of the first Englishmen\u2019 had evidently come sailing.[CITATION-30] Attentiveness to landscape grew still more pronounced in Green\u2019s later work, much of it undertaken in collaboration with his wife Alice\u2014witness the extensive use of archaeology and geography in(1881), for instance.[CITATION-31] It helps explain, moreover, why (again like Trevelyan after him) Green\u2019s writing proved so suited to pictorial accompaniment: 1892 saw the publication of a four-volume \u2018illustrated\u2019 version of his, edited by his wife and Kate Norgate, one of his proteg\u00e9es, scholar of Angevin England and another notably topographically engaged historian.[CITATION-32] The medieval history written by these historians had a visual quality derived from their engagement with landscape\u2014from their insistence, as Freeman put it in his, that \u2018the finished historian must be a traveller; he must see with his own eyes the true look of a wide land; he must see too with his eyes the very spots where great events happened\u2019.[CITATION-33] It was an approach that would be carried forward into the twentieth century by Trevelyan. Indeed, its persistence in rude health calls into question the idea that a late Victorian professionalisation of scholarship caused a decline of popular interest in history, which retreated behind the rebarbative ramparts of ivory tower academia.[CITATION-34] It may be the case, as Rosemary Mitchell has suggested, that loosely factual or straightforwardly fictive versions of what she calls \u2018picturesque history\u2019 had slipped into desuetude by the 1860s\u2014one could place the historical novels of Harrison Ainsworth in that category\u2014but the English popular imaginary remained suffused with historical consciousness.[CITATION-35] If anything, and doubtless stimulated by the histories of Green, Freeman and others, the mid-to-late Victorian and Edwardian periods saw a broadening of this historical consciousness, as it gained new significance and was put to new uses across a range of political and cultural fields. Moreover, in many of its more important manifestations it remained closely associated with the medieval past and its heritage in the landscape, and was invested with a patriotic charge as never before.This can be seen in the arena of political debate. Reference to the past was integral to politics across the nineteenth century, with different historical periods, events and figures invoked in the service of various ideological agendas.[CITATION-36] Such was nothing new\u2014consider the use made of the \u2018ancient constitution\u2019 in the seventeenth century\u2014but it assumed notably varied and broad-ranging forms in the democratising context of the Victorian period.[CITATION-37] Many of these forms were medieval, with the Middle Ages being found useful not just on the conservative end of the political spectrum, as Alice Chandler has emphasised,[CITATION-38] but by those more liberal\u2014and even radical or socialist\u2014in their allegiances.[CITATION-39] Magna Carta, for example, provided inspiration for radical groups\u2014most obviously the Chartists\u2014as well as ballast for the patriotic constitutionalism of the Whig-Liberal elite; while for socialists such as William Morris, the guild system of medieval towns offered a model for collective organisation in the present.[CITATION-40] By no means all this liberal-radical medievalism was connected to landscape, but much of it was, directly or indirectly. For many members and supporters of the Liberal party, the idea of the self-governing Anglo-Saxon \u2018Village Community\u2019 gave impetus to their critique of the persisting \u2018feudalism\u2019 of the English countryside\u2014a feudalism that originated with the Norman Conquest. This critique posited the existence of a parlous state of affairs in the nineteenth-century present, one in which an enclosed landscape dominated by great estates was sapping the vitality of the English nation. Charged with patriotic indignation, it portrayed rural local government as under the tyrannously self-interested control of the aristocracy and gentry, and the ownership of land as being progressively concentrated in the hands of these same elites through primogeniture and entail. The result of this, so the argument went, was the political, moral and material degradation of the English countryside, and by extension the inflicting of grave injury on the nation: with no opportunity for an independent living on the land, and no scope for active involvement in the public affairs of their home localities, the able-bodied and ambitious were driven into overcrowded cities, there to sink into squalor to the detriment of the race.In their assault on feudalism, Liberals looked back to the pre-Conquest past. Proposals for elected parish, district and county councils could, in the words of Sir Charles Dilke, be presented as following \u2018the ancient historical lines of free local government in this country\u2019, as \u2018returning to the Saxon polity\u2019 and \u2018undoing the Norman Conquest, through which \u2026 the Saxon township was degraded into the French feudal manor\u2019.[CITATION-41] Similarly, reforms aimed at abolishing the Norman innovations of primogeniture and entail would, it was claimed, bring more and smaller parcels of land onto the market.[CITATION-42] This in turn would promote the diffusion of property ownership and the remaking of large tracts of the English landscape in the image of that which, according to the now-textbook version of history, had obtained in Anglo-Saxon times\u2014a countryside of happy homesteads, where \u2018most free Englishmen possessed a plot of land\u2019 and \u2018[t]he English were therefore a nation of farmers and herdsmen, delighting in a simple out-of-door life\u2019.[CITATION-43] From the mid-1880s, echoes of this vision of England were also heard in demands for a smallholdings act\u2014the famous \u2018three acres and a cow\u2019\u2014to benefit agricultural labourers newly possessed of the parliamentary vote.[CITATION-44] They received further airing in the Edwardian period, which saw the Liberal cry for land reform reach its culminating pitch of intensity.[CITATION-45] By this time, however, the Liberal attack on \u2018feudalism\u2019 drew less strength from evocations of the Anglo-Saxon past and its landscape than it had done previously. In the heady days of Lloyd George\u2019s great crusade against \u2018landlordism\u2019 in 1910\u201314 more emphasis was placed on the pre-enclosure landscape as offering inspiration for future reform. But Liberal accounts of the violation of this landscape by landlords and landlord-dominated parliaments nevertheless pointed the finger at a system with its origins in the medieval past. The late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century loss of the commons that had sustained the self-sufficient livelihoods of small \u2018yeoman\u2019 farmers was the crowning infamy of a feudal order whose control over politics (through the House of Lords) and territory (through landlordism) now needed to be broken once and for all. As Lloyd George told the National Liberal Federation in 1911, \u2018The feudal system might have been very useful in the Dark Ages, but it is absolutely unsuited to the needs of to-day. It is just like clothing a member of the Territorial Army in a coat of armour; it impedes his movements, weighs him down\u2019.[CITATION-46] Liberals were not the only ones exercised by the evils of feudalism. A stronger critique was offered by socialists, and, as Paul Ward has shown, the arguments they mustered savoured strongly of patriotism.[CITATION-47] Theirs was a patriotism rooted both in the soil and in radical readings of history\u2014in a conviction that the land of England must truly belong to the English people, as in the past. More particularly, the past they looked to was a medieval one, and specifically that of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, which for socialists like Morris and H.M. Hyndman was a golden age of pastoral plenty, when land was held in common and men were free from the drudgery of the mechanistic wage-slavery that would be imposed in later centuries. In propounding this vision of a pre-Reformation Merrie England as an inspiration for radical reform\u2014even revolution\u2014in the present, these socialists did not seek to resuscitate the actual social conditions of the Middle Ages.[CITATION-48] They took a selective approach. In, Morris\u2019s account of a Utopian England of the future, beneficial aspects of the medieval past\u2014common ownership of land, craftworking, the collectivism of guild association\u2014were retained, while bad elements\u2014notably the tyranny of lords temporal and spiritual\u2014were removed.[CITATION-49] But one constant was the emphasis on the medieval landscape as emblem, expression and enabler of the \u2018perfect freedom\u2019 enjoyed by ordinary English people. This was an open, unhedged and unenclosed landscape; its synecdoche was the heath, forest or common. Thus it was that in, his novel about the Peasants\u2019 Revolt of 1381, Morris had his protagonist hear a singer in a tavern recite a ballad about Robin Hood, one \u2018concerning the struggle against tyranny for the freedom of life, how that the wild wood and the heath, despite of wind and weather, were better for a free man than the court and the cheaping-town\u2019. As others joined in the singing, \u2018a picture of the wild-woods passed by me, as they were indeed, no park-like dainty glades and lawns, but rough and tangled thicket and bare waste and heath, solemn under the morning sun, and dreary with the rising of the evening wind and the drift of the night-long rain\u2019.[CITATION-50] Elsewhere in the book Morris offered a more felicitous version of the unenclosed \u2018waste\u2019 in describing a village common, complete with grazing geese, a herd of cows and a willow-lined stream wending through it. And significantly, it is on this common that the men of Kent, led by John Ball, are depicted by Morris as beginning their armed rebellion. The common\u2019s status as a landscape of freedom is underscored by it becoming a battlefield on which the poor wreak bloody vengeance on the sheriff, knights and lawyers bent on depriving them of their birth-right in the soil.[CITATION-51] The common was crucial to socialist invocations of the past because it was access to common land\u2014so the argument went\u2014that had supported the people of the Middle Ages in freedom and plenty. As we have seen, this was a view shared by many Liberals and radicals (even though they were less likely to date the loss of this landscape of liberty to the enclosures of Henry VIII or the Dissolution of the Monasteries than to agricultural \u2018improvements\u2019 from the late eighteenth century). Yet the significance of the medieval common extended beyond the bounds of political debate. In the industrial society of nineteenth-century England, the common did not merely serve as inspiration for land reform projects and socialist dreams; its real-life meaning and use-value was a subject of considerable cultural concern.Where still present in the landscape, commons were seen as survivals from the medieval past, what Freeman in hiscalled \u2018the remains of the most ancient forms of property\u2019.[CITATION-52] Many were found in woodland, not least because these were places less amenable to agricultural improvement. Often, they were also places in which commoners continued to exercise rights inherited from medieval times, such as pasturage, turbary (turf-cutting) and pannage (the turning out of pigs to forage): examples include Epping Forest, the Forest of Dean and the New Forest. Early nineteenth-century views of these old deciduous woodlands had not generally been favourable. Commenting on the New Forest in his(1830), William Cobbett saw the decay of its ancient trees, the lack of silvicultural management and the prevalence of pests such as rabbits as symbolic of the Crown\u2019s mismanagement of the nation\u2019s domain: the forest was a physical embodiment of Old Corruption.[CITATION-53] Others indicted not the officials who managed the woods, but the smallholders and charcoal-burners who for generations had relied on their common rights to scrape a livelihood.[CITATION-54] The exercise of these rights was felt to frustrate the improvement of the landscape. It prevented the planting of healthy stands of trees required for England\u2019s growing economy\u2014and, until mid-century, the wooden walls of the Royal Navy.[CITATION-55] Different languages of patriotism, then, conceived the medieval heritage in forest landscape as problematic: it was either a feudal relic, anathema to the liberties of the freeborn Englishman, or the vestige of an agricultural system at odds with the prerequisites of a modernising nation, one that needed to make maximal use of its natural resources.After mid-century, however, ancient forests began to be viewed in more positive terms. In some accounts, they were prized as giving imaginative access to an older and more picturesque England, their primitive charm offering refreshment to the jaded sensibilities of \u2018prisoners of civilisation, and walkers among brick-walls\u2019.[CITATION-56] More particularly, and assisted by the burgeoning popularity of the Robin Hood myth, they were increasingly seen as landscapes of liberty, places that embodied a specifically English spirit of freedom that traced its origins to medieval times.[CITATION-57] The oaks that were so prized a feature of these woodlands were associated not only with the liberty-preserving Navy (the foundation of which was attributed to Alfred the Great),[CITATION-58] but with the Anglo-Saxon roots of English self-government. Oaks were said to mark the gathering-place for the proto-parliamentary \u2018open-air assembly\u2019 of the \u2018Folk-Moot\u2019.[CITATION-59] But more important than the historical associations attaching to the trees themselves was the commonable character of the landscape. Thus in the New Forest and the Forest of Dean, the rights jealously guarded by the smallholders were now a happy \u2018relic of Saxon liberties\u2019, as were the ancient Courts of Verderers\u2014or \u2018Swainmotes\u2019\u2014that oversaw their exercise.[CITATION-60] This was seen to conduce to a distinctively English\u2014and distinctively beautiful\u2014forest landscape, one characterised not by dense plantations of conifers or \u2018jungles of untamed nature\u2019, but open broadleaf woodlands, their development being shaped by the cottage economy of the \u2018small man\u2019 who lived amongst them.[CITATION-61] Such a perspective conscripted the once-maligned commoners into the ranks of a larger argument about land rights\u2014one that was directed not only at forest \u2018wastes\u2019 but commons more generally. By the late nineteenth century, commoners had become ideal-type Englishmen\u2014independent, self-sufficient, and rooted to the soil at a time of a much-deprecated \u2018rural exodus\u2019 to city slums. They were a class of people that both Conservatives and Liberals sought to preserve through various schemes of legislative reform. But the originally medieval rights that accorded commoners their livelihoods were increasingly seen as standing proxy for wider claims of access to land. In this interpretation, common land was a birth-right inherited from Saxon times; but in the context of political democratisation, it was now seen as one shared by the whole people.This shift in attitudes found expression in organised agitation for the preservation of commons from enclosure, whether for agricultural or building developments. Spearheaded by the liberal intellectuals of the Commons Preservation Society (CPS), a well-connected pressure group established in 1865, the campaign was notably successful: landmark achievements included the rescue of Epping Forest, Hampstead Heath and other metropolitan commons, as well as protective parliamentary legislation.[CITATION-62] Its leaders elaborated a new conception of public amenity in landscape, one that drew legitimacy from the medieval past: the antiquity of commons justified their preservation for the good of an increasingly urbanised nation\u2014not least on account of their associations with that spirit of popular liberty, rooted in Anglo-Saxon times, which many saw as central to Englishness. Reflecting on the successes of the CPS to 1894, G.J. Shaw-Lefevre, one of the society\u2019s founders, concluded that the result of its activism \u2018has been to reverse [the] idea of absolute ownership of Lords of Manors in the waste lands of their districts \u2026 to restore to the Commons something of the attributes of the ancient Saxon Folk-Land, and to establish the principle that they concern the interests of \u2026 the public generally\u2019.[CITATION-63] Thus it was that a distinctively medieval feature of the English countryside served to drive the modern-day movement for landscape preservation, as it got underway in the late Victorian period. This charged the movement with a sense of patriotic urgency; it made it an expression of English cultural nationalism.Further impetus came in 1895, with the establishment of the National Trust as a body for the acquisition and holding in perpetuity of \u2018places of historical interest or natural beauty\u2019. Many of its early leaders were active in the CPS\u2014Octavia Hill is one example\u2014and the two organisations shared similar outlooks.[CITATION-64] In particular, they were both actuated by a patriotic regard for the nation\u2019s medieval inheritance in the landscape. For the CPS, the focus was common land, and latterly footpaths. Described by Hardwicke Rawnsley (who with Hill was one of its founders) as \u2018the youngest-born of our patriotic societies that aim at preserving beautiful and historic Great Britain to future generations\u2019, the National Trust had a wider remit.[CITATION-65] But the Trust\u2019s commitment to preserving beauty spots such as Gowbarrow in the Lake District ran alongside deep concern for places with links to the Middle Ages. The first English building that came into its hands, in 1896, was a pre-Reformation clergy house at Alfriston in Sussex; acquired the same year, its first English landscape was Barras Head in Cornwall, a place saturated by associations with the myth-history of King Arthur and Tennyson\u2019s. Offering what Hill thought was \u2018the best view of the Castle of Tintagel\u2019, the thirteenth-century ruins of which had become a popular tourist destination, the place\u2014\u2018so dear to us all from legend and poetry\u2019\u2014offered a potent combination of picturesque clifftop scenery and medieval historical romance.[CITATION-66] The lure of Camelot evident here is consistent with the persisting cultural purchase of what David Matthews calls the \u2018Romantic Middle Ages\u2019, and specifically the chivalric ideals with which the Arthur legend was connected.[CITATION-67] Indeed, the cause of landscape preservation more generally was sometimes associated with knightly virtues, the upper middle-class leaders of the National Trust, the CPS and others being presented as actuated by selfless concern for the welfare of ordinary Englishmen and women. It was in this vein thatcharacterised the resistance successfully offered to schemes, proposed in the 1880s, for the construction of railways in the Lake District. With its Arthurian caption of \u2018The Ladies of the Lakes\u2019, a cartoon () celebrating the defeat of one of these schemes featured \u2018The three lovely Damsels, Ennerdale, Borrowdale, and Derwentwater\u2019 being \u2018rescued by the doughty knight of St. Stephen\u2019s\u2019\u2014the parliamentary allies of the CPS\u2014\u2018from the railway rough and mineral miscreant who would have done them a fatal injury\u2019.[CITATION-68] \u2018The Ladies of the Lakes\u2019,, 28 July 1883, p. 39. Reproduced with permission from Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford.The medieval-chivalric inflections present in preservationist discourse might seem to support a conservative reading of the movement; from the 1839 Eglinton Tournament on, ideals of courtly virtue were closely associated with elite culture, having received the imprimatur of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.[CITATION-69] Indeed, some scholars and commentators have applied such a reading to the National Trust.[CITATION-70] For Paula Weideger, \u2018from its beginnings the National Trust seems to have been involved in stopping the clock\u2019, before later \u2018trying to run it backwards\u2019.[CITATION-71] Yet such an emphasis gives a distorted picture. Whatever view might be taken of the later history of the Trust, not least its enthusiastic acquisition of stately homes after the Second World War,[CITATION-72] it is misleading to see its early activities as expressive of a reactionary Englishness. To be sure, some of its supporters were Conservatives, but its leading lights were mostly Liberals and radicals.[CITATION-73] But more than this, the early focus of the Trust\u2019s campaigning was not on the mansions of the rich: only one of its pre-1914 properties\u2014Barrington Court in Somerset\u2014was a country house, and its acquisition was undertaken reluctantly.[CITATION-74] Its patriotic mission was not to preserve historic landscapes of feudal hierarchy, but to restore England to the English people through the preservation of access to valued landscapes. Many of these landscapes were medieval, and they were valued precisely because of their associations with quotidian lived experience; in a sense they were landscapes of social history, settings for the story that J.R. Green had told so vividly in hisAs Hill put it, there was \u2018nothing great\u2019 or \u2018very striking\u2019 about the buildings in these landscapes. Yet in this ordinariness lay their significance. Places such as Alfriston Clergy House, Tintagel Post Office (a fourteenth-century cottage acquired a few years after nearby Barras Head), or the bridges at Eashing, near Godalming, said to date back to the reign of King John, were quietly evocative of \u2018simple life long ago\u2019. Their value lay in \u2018carrying the mind back to the days of our fathers, and to that out of which England has grown\u2019.[CITATION-75] Even landscapes in which there was no built record of the Middle Ages could recall the day-to-day past of medieval England. Commons are a case in point. Although they were the special concern of the CPS, many fell into the hands of the National Trust. One example was Minchinhampton Common in the Cotswolds (acquired 1913), the title deeds for which went back to Domesday; another was Ludshott Common in Hampshire (1908), whose heathland\u2014and the rights to which it was subject\u2014had supported agricultural communities for centuries.[CITATION-76] Other National Trust-owned landscapes were similarly evocative. Like Ludshott Common, Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire (1899) offered access to the rural England of medieval times, in this case\u2014as G.M. Trevelyan later reflected after one of his many visits there\u2014the distinctive landscape of \u2018reeds, sedge, willow and innumerable other growths \u2026 that once spread from Cambridge to Lincoln\u2019.[CITATION-77] Still other such places were suggestive of the religious life and customs of the distant past, providing evidence of the long continuities of Christian faith in England. Purchased in 1913 with the proceeds of a public fundraising campaign, the 60-acre tract of downland at Colley Hill near Reigate in Surrey was valuable not just for its natural beauty, but also for its associations with the Pilgrims\u2019 Way\u2014the route by which medieval penitents travelled to Canterbury and the shrine of Thomas Becket. Immortalised by Chaucer, the Pilgrims\u2019 Way crossed Colley Hill, and so it was appropriate that its dedication to the Trust was celebrated with an historical pageant: this involved a procession of costumed performers along the line of \u2018the old trackway\u2019, which was \u2018now at last assured to the pilgrims of to-day as free and as open as when, seven hundred years ago, the votaries of St. Thomas passed \u2026 to his shrine at the Reigate cross roads\u2019.[CITATION-78] The priorities of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century landscape preservation intersected with changing recreational practices. Bank Holidays, shorter working hours and reduced travel costs led to the exponential expansion of the domestic tourist industry: seaside resorts such as Blackpool boomed. But it was not all sun and sandcastles; there was a parallel growth in what today might be termed \u2018heritage tourism\u2019. As never before, people sought access to the past via holiday experiences of the English landscape; and in doing so, much of their attention focused on places evocative of the Middle Ages. This is clear from the literature that proliferated to meet the needs of these history-conscious tourists, the volume and variety of which it is difficult to exaggerate. Handbooks were produced for specific places rich in medieval associations. Examples include the New Forest, Tintagel, and\u2014at a still finer degree of granularity\u2014the Westbury and Uffington White Horses in Wiltshire and Berkshire, two sites closely associated with King Alfred\u2019s victory over the Danes in 878 that were celebrated as a reminder of \u2018the blessings we enjoy in our long exemption from foreign yoke\u2019, and further popularised as heritage in the writings of Thomas Hughes.[CITATION-79] Much of this literature, however, encompassed whole categories of tourist attraction, such as abbeys, castles and cathedrals, with a view to elucidating the medieval history of these most visible signs of the past in the landscape. Major ventures included Cassell\u2019s(1887) and Ward Lock\u2019s \u2018Cathedral Cities of England and Wales\u2019 series, volumes of which appeared from the late 1880s.[CITATION-80] Dense with detail and often written by clergymen, these books drew heavily on the work of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century antiquaries (as well as classic authorities such as William Camden and John Leland). To some extent, they represented a continuation of this long-established tradition of gentlemanly-amateur engagement with the physical remains of the past in the landscape.[CITATION-81] What was certainly new, however, was the volume and diversity of the texts produced: antiquarianism, sometimes seen as falling into decay in the late nineteenth century,[CITATION-82] was disseminated to a much wider public. At one level, and perhaps claiming the strongest kinship with that which had come before, were those books aimed at a serious-minded middle-class market; some of them, for instance R.J. King\u2019s perhaps misnamed five-volume \u2018handbook\u2019 to the cathedrals of England, published by Murray\u2019s between 1861 and 1879, would have proved cumbersome items of holiday impedimenta.[CITATION-83] But the vibrancy of the market for these kind of books should not be underestimated. Many of the more accessible (and portable) publications sold well. All the volumes in Ward Lock\u2019s \u2018Cathedral Cities\u2019 series were priced at 1and all ran to numerous editions before 1914. Indeed, Ward Lock\u2019s success prompted rival publishers such as George Bell to bring out their own \u2018Cathedral series\u2019 (as Bell\u2019s did in 1896), while J.M. Dent\u2014later famous for its Everyman books\u2014inaugurated a long-running \u2018Mediaeval Towns\u2019 series in 1898.[CITATION-84] Aimed at a more popular market still were the guides published by the Great Western Railway (GWR), many of which harped at length on the medieval heritage made accessible by its network. One example was the(1908), priced at 3, which was presented as being \u2018of especial interest to the vast number of people who like to read about and visit such ecclesiastical edifices for which the G.W.R. is famous\u2019.[CITATION-85] Guides to Britain as a whole, for instance Baedeker\u2019s, also lavished attention on medieval churches, abbeys, cathedrals and castles\u2014an emphasis that was underlined by the inclusion of an \u2018Historical Sketch of Architecture in England\u2019 by E.A. Freeman, which was largely preoccupied with the pre-Reformation ecclesiastical built environment.[CITATION-86] Yet still more striking in their engagement not just with architecture but with the medieval landscape more broadly, were the guides to English counties produced in diluvial quantities by a range of publishers. The gold standard was set by John Murray, whose hardback handbooks began appearing in the 1850s; typically running to several editions each, they proved popular with educated middle-class readers.[CITATION-87] Freighted with antiquarian detail (quotations from William Camden\u2019s(1586) or Michael Drayton\u2019s(1612\u201322) were not uncommon), they provided authoritative descriptions of tourist sites and discussions of their historical associations. To this was conjoined an emphasis on the picturesque quality of these sites, many of which were not only situated in wooded, rugged or remote rural locales but featured asymmetrically scenic ruins as well. Reflective of the persisting importance of picturesque ways of seeing the landscape in late Victorian and Edwardian English culture more broadly, not least evident in the practice of artists and photographers,[CITATION-88] the suggested itineraries detailed in Murray\u2019s guides displayed a preference for landscapes rich in such attributes. Thus, the one-week tour recommended in the fourth edition of the(1904) involved visits to the ruins of Helmsley Castle, three further castles, four abbeys (Rievaulx, Byland, Jervaulx, Bolton), and at least four ancient parish churches.[CITATION-89] Similar emphases are apparent in the county guides of other publishers. Those produced by Adam and Charles Black were perhaps most like Murray\u2019s, not least in their recourse to antiquarian exactitude and courting of a self-consciously cultivated history-aware market. In the thirteenth edition of(1888), for example, approximately one-third of the total text\u2014and two-thirds of the illustrations\u2014was devoted to medieval subjects. Much space was given over to detailing the findings of antiquaries, citing classic as well as contemporaneous authorities (the entry for Pontefract began with a long extract from Camden), and discussing recondite points of dispute\u2014such as the vexed question as to the genuineness of the epitaph originally engraved over \u2018Robin Hood\u2019s tomb\u2019 at Kirklees.[CITATION-90] This kind of content was appropriate given the publishing house\u2014Black\u2019s was the publisher of Walter Scott, whose works were extensively quoted in the guides[CITATION-91] \u2014but it nevertheless gives a good indication of the extent of touristic engagement with the medieval past. This is further borne out by the sheer popularity of Black\u2019s guides, which were significantly cheaper than Murray\u2019s (many were just 1), and by the proliferation of other inexpensive publications of a similar kind.[CITATION-92] Examples of the latter include Stanford\u2019s \u2018tourist guides\u2019, available from 1876 at 2each, Nelson\u2019s \u2018Thorough Guides\u2019 (from 1880), Methuen\u2019s \u2018Little Guides\u2019 (from 1898), and Ward Lock\u2019s various one-shilling \u2018illustrated\u2019, \u2018historical\u2019, and \u2018pictorial and descriptive\u2019 guides (from around 1880), as well as the same publisher\u2019s series of \u2018Guide Books to the British Isles\u2019 (from 1896). To varying degrees, all laid considerable emphasis on the medieval heritage in the landscape.In the late Victorian and Edwardian period, then, the \u2018antiquarian tourist\u2019\u2014to use a moniker common at the time\u2014occupied an important section of the market. Of course, the people who fell into this category evinced differing levels of interest in the medieval past: for some, its pursuit would have been the primary object of a holiday; for others, it would have been one of any number of eagerly anticipated activities. But the evidence of both mainstream and specialised guidebooks (those aimed at walkers and cyclists, for example) makes clear the normative importance of history-conscious tourism, and the significance of the Middle Ages to that activity.[CITATION-93] This reflects the continued growth of interest in the English past in these years, a phenomenon traceable in the persisting vitality of local archaeological, antiquarian and historical societies, and the popularity both of serious history-writing such as Green\u2019sand belletrist historical literature of less intellectual merit.[CITATION-94] It was also apparent,, in the fashion for the commemoration of historical anniversaries (the King Alfred Millenary of 1901 is one example), the preservationist movement, and the Edwardian enthusiasm for historical pageants.[CITATION-95] Much of this engagement with the past had a patriotic inflection, being focused on the maintenance of a sense of national continuity at a time of rapid social, cultural and technological change. Such a focus is also apparent in the guidebook literature, which supplies particularly good evidence of the special importance of the medieval landscape in providing a tangible record of the nation\u2019s antiquity and its survival through the vicissitudes of centuries.Many guidebooks made much of the religious heritage in the landscape, presenting medieval churches, abbeys and cathedrals as appealing on account of \u2018their inseparable alliance with the history of the country\u2019.[CITATION-96] They were celebrated as physical embodiments of the nation\u2019s long and continuous legacy of Christian worship, so complementing the accounts offered in Anglican historical scholarship.[CITATION-97] This reflected the centrality of a broad-based rather than\u2014as had been the case in the past\u2014specifically Protestant Christianity to English (and British) national identity.[CITATION-98] In the eyes of many late Victorians and Edwardians, the post-Reformation Anglican establishment was a modern development of a pre-existing, autochthonous and thoroughly national religious tradition. It was in this vein that Baedeker\u2019s entry for Glastonbury quoted Freeman to the effect that the eponymous abbey \u2018can trace its foundation back to the 6cent. and is \u201cthe one great institution which bore up untouched through the storm of English Conquest, the one great tie which binds our race to the race which went before us, and which binds the church of the last 1300 years to the earlier days of Christianity in Britain\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-99] Glastonbury Abbey, of course, was a specific site with specific associations. But the long history and continuity of English Christianity could also be read in more extensive tracts of landscape. This is apparent in the fifth edition (1892) of Murray\u2019s guidebook to Kent, a county which, so the text assured its readers, \u2018has been the scene of some of the more important events in English history\u2019. For not only had Kent witnessed the Saxon landings at Ebbsfleet in 449, \u2018which introduced the Teutonic element, and laid the foundations of \u201cthis happy breed of men, this earth, this England\u201d\u2019, it had also been \u2018the scene of the landing of \u2026 Augustine \u2026 who reintroduced Christianity, and from the results of whose mission \u201chas, by degrees, arisen the whole constitution of Church and State in England which now binds together the whole British Empire\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-100] As presented by Murray\u2019s, Kent was a place where a resonantly evocative ecclesiastical built environment\u2014notably that of Canterbury Cathedral, acclaimed as having \u2018all the impressiveness of some great natural feature, rock, or mountain rising from the midst of a broad level valley\u2019[CITATION-101] \u2014was integral to a larger landscape whose medieval associations made it a synecdoche of the English nation and the felicitous continuities of its history. Thus, in the entry for the Isle of Thanet (which echoes Green\u2019s own description in his), the opinion is offered that \u2018Few prospects are of higher historical interest\u2019 than the stirring view from the higher ground near the coast:Far and wide, and glowing with corn-fields, spreads out the panorama of East Kent, with its old Saxon graveyards and memorials. Ebbe\u2019s Fleet, where Augustine landed and where Hengist is said to have landed before him, may be traced by its line of trees in the marsh \u2026 N. are the twin spires of Reculver, and W. the great towers of Canterbury cathedral rise dark against the blue distance. An entire history of England lies open before us. The very changes of the landscape,\u2014the steam of the train, the sea covered with sails, the rich cultivation,\u2014suggest the contrast of that distant time when Augustine landed here \u2018in finibus mundi\u2019, a messenger to a barbarous people, whose land was covered with thick woods and desolate marshes,\u2014yet bringing with him the germs of so much coming change and prosperity.[CITATION-102] As this passage illustrates, landscape saturated by associations with the distant past of the nation was not regarded as an anachronistic survival, nor\u2014very often\u2014was it invoked to support cries of threnodic lament about the ills of contemporary England. In Murray\u2019s presentation of the countryside around Ebbsfleet, change is evidence of national progress: the links to the medieval that remain in the landscape support a positive perspective on modernity.Other guidebooks showed a similar desire to trace continuities between the Middle Ages and the present through landscape, as a means of emphasising the vitality of modern-day England. In a sense, this was a continuation\u2014in a somewhat different form\u2014of an established tradition of local historical and guidebook writing, the origins of which can be traced at least as far back to eighteenth-century urban histories.[CITATION-103] Thus the \u2018Popular edition\u2019 of the(1895), commended Norwich for its \u2018venerable Norman cathedral\u2019 and castle, which testified to the city\u2019s glorious past, but also for its modern buildings, which, being \u2018admirably designed to meet the demands of a busy mercantile community\u2019, gave evidence of continued prosperity in the present.[CITATION-104] In the same vein, the judgment of another railway guide that York was \u2018no mean city\u2019 was not exclusively based on its medieval heritage, but on the integration of this heritage with \u2018the advanced and progressive tendencies of the nineteenth century\u2019.[CITATION-105] This accent on the compatibility between the Middle Ages and modernity was true even in commentary on places where little visible trace was left of the medieval past. It was in this spirit that thediscussed the history of the great castle that had once stood near the present-day site of the railway station at Northampton\u2014a history \u2018which extends back to the Danish occupation\u2019 and included the hosting of twenty parliaments\u2014while acknowledging that \u2018there are no vestiges of remains\u2019 in the streetscape.[CITATION-106] The Homeland Association (HA) provides another case-study of the ways in which continuities with the medieval past gave rootedness to the experience of modernity. Established as a limited company in the 1890s, the HA produced a plethora of inexpensive topographical handbooks and guides, all paying special attention to the heritage of the locales of which they treated. Largely focused on southern England, and especially the metropolitan hinterland, the HA\u2019s publications were many and various; surprisingly, they have been overlooked by scholars. Among the series produced were(from 1898), which aimed to \u2018contain everything likely to interest the intelligent visitor concerning the History, Traditions, Worthies, Antiquities and Literary Associations of the neighbourhoods with which they deal\u2019; history-heavy(from 1906); and(from 1907), which had as their focus \u2018the history and antiquities of \u2026 towns, together with their advantages as places of residence or as holiday resorts\u2019. There were also(from 1905), \u2018each describing a touring district or some tract of country possessing special topographical interest; or dealing with a subject of interest related to the historical features of the Homeland\u2019.[CITATION-107] In all these publications the medieval associations of the landscape loomed large, but they were invoked to serve distinctly modern purposes. As signalled by its nomenclature, the HA sought to tap a well of nativist patriotism by celebrating the storied ground of England. Yet in doing so, it also sought to meet the needs of a specific constituency: the expanding suburban middle class, from whose ranks its founder, Prescott Row, was himself drawn.[CITATION-108] Its guides reflected the proclivities of a self-consciously modern social category\u2014aspirational suburbanites who combined an interest in the historical associations of the physical environment with a wholehearted adoption of the appurtenances of early twentieth-century lifestyles. Thus it was, for example, that thecombined information about the medieval heritage of commuter-belt locales of various kinds, whether outwardly \u2018old-world\u2019 or not, with practical advice about motoring, golf, season ticket fares, schools, utility charges and even the death rates of individual neighbourhoods.The Homeland Association was bound up with the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century growth of suburbia, dormitory towns and practices of long-distance commuting\u2014developments which had been enabled by improvements in transport facilities. Since the 1840s, the railway network had become more extensive, progressively denser around large conurbations, as well as more efficient, with more frequent and regular services. Most of all, as first enabled by the 1844 Railway Act, which made cheap fares a requirement on all routes, travel by train was increasingly affordable. It was thus that the pre-eminent expression of nineteenth-century technological modernity\u2014the railway\u2014facilitated popular access to the medieval past, allowing people from all social classes first-hand experience of the historic landscape of England. An early prognostication of this technology-enabled enhancement of history-consciousness was offered by William Howitt, in his(1840). Recounting a trip to Winchester, Howitt reflected happily that its Anglo-Saxon history would soon be better known, thanks to steam power having brought the place within two hours of London:As I sat on St. Giles\u2019s-hill, pondering on all the past history of the place, suddenly came the steam-engine with its train, fuming and flying through the quiet district. The effect was startling. The two extremes of English history were brought suddenly and unexpectedly together, and I could almost imagine the old Saxon kings, upspringing from their sleep in the cathedral, to inquire what new and strange power had burst into their dreamy and so long undisturbed dominion. The restless spirit of thehas, indeed, broken in;\u2014it cannot wake the dead, but it will bring to thea better knowledge of the old![CITATION-109] Howitt perceives a jolting contrast between the medieval past, as embodied in the ancient capital of England, and the brash puissance of the Victorian present; but there is compatibility in the juxtaposition. The railway is not a threat to the past, something that might sweep it out of sight and mind, but the agent of its wider and deeper appreciation. Howitt was surely right: the steam engine allowed people to travel (back) in time as well as (forward) through space, in this way conferring a greater sense of connection to the history of England as a whole, of facilitating a more integrated territorialisation of national memory. To invoke Benedict Anderson\u2019s deservedly popular concept, rail travel was a vital means through which the national community was imagined by ordinary people: it provided them with the opportunity to access the history\u2014made visible through experience of landscape\u2014that was a crucial constituent of the raw material from which Englishness was constructed.[CITATION-110] Interest in historical sites that were now readily accessible by railway was to a certain extent pre-existing, since many such sites had loomed large in the extant corpus of antiquarian literature, not least that associated with historic towns and cities (much of which had been motivated by a patriotic desire to demonstrate the importance of such places and their histories to the longer narratives of Englishness).[CITATION-111] They had also featured in monumental topographical projects such as John Britton and Edward Brayley\u2019s multi-volume(1801\u201316) and the popular illustrated publications of Charles Knight, most notably his(1845), which themselves had done much to propagate the idea of a national stake in a national historical landscape.[CITATION-112] But with the coming of the railway came a slew of new publications, many directly associated with the railway companies themselves. Appearing from the early 1850s on, George Measom\u2019s \u2018official\u2019 railway guides are one case in point, combining appreciation of the medieval past in the landscape with attentiveness to the industrial modernity of town- and cityscapes.[CITATION-113] Later decades saw railway companies publish guidebooks on their own account, the number of such texts increasing markedly in the later nineteenth century. Available in both standard and \u2018popular\u2019 editions, the official guidebooks published by Cassell\u2019s placed a patriotic emphasis on the technological modernity of \u2018the gigantic railway system which has girded our land with a vast network of iron ways\u2019\u2014a \u2018feature of our national life\u2019 which, as the guide to the London and North Western Railway put it, was \u2018characteristic \u2026 of the resistless ingenuity, energy, and perseverance of the British people\u2019.[CITATION-114] Much ink was spilled on the grandeur and functionality of stations, the modern conveniences of railway travel (the \u2018Pullman\u2019 cabins, the \u2018sleeping cars with lavatory accommodation\u2019), and the miraculous speed of state-of-the-art locomotives such as the Flying Scotsman.[CITATION-115] But the books also displayed an equally pronounced but differently patriotic emphasis on the historical landscapes\u2014many medieval\u2014that these marvellously efficient arrangements had brought into reach. The guide to the Great Northern Railway began its introductory adumbration of the attractions served by the line with \u2018grand minsters\u2019\u2014then \u2018castellated remains\u2019, \u2018baronial homes\u2019, \u2018ruined abbeys\u2019 and \u2018ancestral halls\u2019.[CITATION-116] In many entries in these guidebooks, the assumption was that the tourist appeal of a place was determined by its historical interest, which in turn was related to the role it could claim in the larger history of the nation. Thus the \u2018small agricultural centre\u2019 of Framlingham in Suffolk had \u2018most intimate connections\u2019 with English history via the extensive ruins of its castle (\u2018proud feudal home of the Norman Bigods\u2019),[CITATION-117] while the landscape of suburban High Barnet was given national significance through the site of the Battle of Barnet, one of the last battles of the Wars of the Roses.[CITATION-118] In this way, the guides integrated the medieval history of localities with that of the nation, augmenting the nationally integrative effect of the railway network itself.Other forms of transport and their associated publications also integrated the local and the national in this way. By the 1890s, cycling had become a popular means of exploring the countryside near large urban areas. Cyclists were soon joined by motorists, whose enthusiasm for speed and the open road was compatible with often well-developed interest in historical sites. For Rudyard Kipling, \u2018the chief end of my car\u2019\u2014which he called a \u2018time-machine\u2019\u2014was \u2018the discovery of England\u2019.[CITATION-119] By no means all motorists and cyclists placed such emphasis on the efficacy of their vehicles in this respect, but Kipling\u2019s were sentiments with which many would have felt affinity. Noting that at least a dozen guidebooks to Essex had appeared in the eighteen months to the end of June 1909, an editorial in theremarked that \u2018the wheels of the motor-car and of the bicycle have set the wheels of the printing press revolving\u2019.[CITATION-120] In Essex as elsewhere in England, the fashion for pedal- and petrol-powered tourism had further stimulated the demand for history-rich topographical information, and many of the publications aimed at these new categories of holidaymaker were saturated with references to the medieval past in particular.[CITATION-121] Whether they travelled by train, bicycle or car, many of these history-conscious tourists set off equipped with cameras. Some were committed amateur photographers, belonging to clubs, exhibiting, perhaps even selling their pictures. Publications such as(from 1884) ran numerous articles aimed at cyclists, directing them to locales whose photogenic interest correlated with their ancientness: it was thus that an article on Bedfordshire made special recommendation of Kempston as \u2018the prettiest village in the shire, dating from Saxon times\u2019.[CITATION-122] It was a similar story for publications associated with train travel, with which photography had an especially strong and synergistic relationship. It was not just that people rode the railway to take photographs of the historical landscape of England; such photographs were themselves powerful incentives to tourist travel. In the early years of railway expansion, amateur and commercial photographers paid much attention to places recently reached, or soon to be reached, by the tentacles of the locomotive octopus, and by the late 1850s there was a large market for such photographs across Britain as a whole.[CITATION-123] This market expanded and diversified further in the late-Victorian and Edwardian periods. One key development here was the explosion in popularity of what became a staple tourist accessory, the picture postcard, with many photographers supplying images to firms such as Raphael Tuck & Son and J. Salmon Ltd.[CITATION-124] Of course, the purchase or receipt of a picture of a place did by no means necessarily prompt a visit to the place in question; in most cases photographs provided a means of getting to know England without leaving the comfort of the armchair. As with actual tourism, this vicarious version of it was an important way in which the nation was imagined as an integrated whole; it was a means of creating a mental map of the historical homeland, its various landmarks, its sites of memory and national continuity. Indeed, it is impossible to exaggerate the importance of photography in this respect. As Walter Benjamin elucidated so influentially, the widespread dissemination of readily reproducible images had a transformative impact on modern culture in general;[CITATION-125] but one of its most significant specific effects was to make possible, as never before, the popular envisioning of the nation.In England, the medieval past was central to such envisioning. To an extent, this was a function of the persisting hold of the picturesque aesthetic, which had a major influence on landscape photography as it developed in the mid-nineteenth century.[CITATION-126] But as in other contexts, the picturesque was fused with an historical sensibility. From the outset, and reflecting a close association with antiquarianism, English landscape photography was suffused with concern for medieval churches, ancient woodlands, ruined abbeys and the like.[CITATION-127] These were the subjects that dominated the first major photographic exhibition in Britain, staged in 1852 by the Photographic Society of London; and as amateur photography developed over the course of that decade they retained their hold on the preferences of its practitioners.[CITATION-128] This hold remained strong into the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, despite the competing attraction of landscapes evocative of the Tudor and Stuart pasts in particular.[CITATION-129] It was in these years, moreover, that there developed probably the most salient manifestation of the interrelationship between photography and history-consciousness: the Photographic Survey movement. Active between the mid-1880s and about 1920, organised at county level and (from 1897) under the aegis of Sir Benjamin Stone\u2019s National Photographic Record Association, the movement sought to create a visual record of the historical topography of England, locality by locality. In doing so, it paid particular attention to the medieval heritage in the landscape and especially that of the English village, affection for which, theopined in 1902, had been \u2018characteristic of the English stock\u2019 from its German-Saxon origins: in her splendid study of the movement, Elizabeth Edwards estimates that about four-fifths of survey photographs focused on the parish and its village.[CITATION-130] Cottages, almshouses, village greens, ancient trees, secluded byways, stocks, hoary old bridges, and, above all, the medieval parish church, were the subjects that dominated, their selection revealing an emphasis on antiquity as an index of value. Old was good, oldest was better\u2014and often the oldest building surviving in any locale was the church, which provided vital evidence of the centuries-spanning continuity of English community life in that one place.What Edwards described as the making of \u2018record photograph[s] of the \u2026 material traces of the past in the landscape\u2019 could be seen as reflecting a withdrawal from or rejection of the modern world\u2014a form of escapism, an expression of reactionary Englishness.[CITATION-131] Yet, for all that political Conservatives were involved in the Photographic Survey (Stone was a Tory MP), such an interpretation would be misleading. As with those active in landscape preservation, amateur photographers sought to maintain links with the medieval past as a means of affirming the continuity of Englishness in the present. Indeed, they exploited the potential of cutting-edge technology\u2014the camera\u2014to extend \u2018the reach of the temporal beyond relations between the present and the past to the future as well, creating an archival grid through which the past might be accessible in an imagined future\u2019.[CITATION-132] They did not seek refuge in the past, but aimed to ensure that the past remained present in the contemporary.Similar motivations actuated those involved in historical pageantry, which developed into a craze before the First World War: contemporaries spoke of \u2018pageant fever\u2019.[CITATION-133] Children, as well as women and men, fell victim to the bug.[CITATION-134] Popularised by Louis Napoleon Parker\u2019s extraordinary success with the Sherborne Pageant of 1905, the amateur re-enactment of scenes from the history of a community made the past live in the present, and\u2014through the agency of memory, assisted by photographic, film and other records of cast-members and performances\u2014on into the future (postcards were especially important in this respect, offering durable, realistic and readily reproducible mementoes of the re-enactment of the past).[CITATION-135] Many pageants were largely medieval in their historical focus, and many were staged outdoors in places richly evocative of the Middle Ages, such as ruined castles, abbeys, and monasteries. While the medieval content of historical pageantry has been discussed in recent scholarship on the movement,[CITATION-136] less attention has been paid to the interrelationship between the pasts that were re-enacted in these spectacular performances, and the landscapes on which\u2014and through which\u2014they were re-enacted. Pageants, and their great popularity, testified to a widespread sense of the congealment of history in landscape. The selection of sites for their staging was undertaken with care because landscape was very often integral to the story being told. Although practical considerations of course played a part, pageant arenas were chosen with an eye on the linkages they offered between \u2018the remote Past\u2019 and \u2018the living Present\u2019, as the organisers of the York pageant of 1909 put it in explaining their choice (the grounds of the thirteenth-century abbey of St Mary).[CITATION-137] Not least because many pageants were performed on or near the spot on which the events they dramatised had actually taken place, these venues offered a visible connection with the past, visible evidence of the continuity of local\u2014and by extension national\u2014identity through time. In commenting on the Pevensey Pageant, held in the ruins of the eponymous castle in July 1908, one newspaper report reflected on how, from the grandstand:the view is perfect \u2026 The grey, ivy-clad walls of the Castle, cutting the sky-line, form the background; on the left the miniature downs billow away in the distance; on the right are the ruins of the town wall, a group of venerable trees, and farther away the gleaming waters of the English Channel. One recalls the thrilling events which have occurred here, and it seems as if this were the centre of historic England \u2026 The Pageant is taking place on what is perhaps the most luminously historic spot in England, and it is an incentive to the best kind of patriotism.[CITATION-138] In this way, pageants brought the past back to vivid life in the landscapes of the present. These included ostensibly unremarkable landscapes, such as the \u2018ordinary English meadow\u2019 that the socialist, suffragist and war correspondent H.V. Nevinson described as being the setting for the 1907 St Albans pageant, a performance of which he witnessed first-hand.[CITATION-139] Michael Saler has pointed to the imaginative \u2018re-enchantment\u2019 of early twentieth-century modernity through fictions such as the Sherlock Holmes stories: suspending their disbelief, Englishmen and women regarded the Baker Street detective as a real character in the real world. This, Saler argues, was a distinctively modern impulse.[CITATION-140] But such re-enchantment of the contemporary could be effected by non-fictive means, too\u2014through the agency of historical imagination. Pageants were a great stimulus to this; more specifically, they were a means through which theof modern England\u2014the physical environment of day-to-day lived experience\u2014was re-enchanted through the dramatisation of scenes from the distant past. One illustration of this is given by an article on the Sherborne Pageant. Published insoon after the run of performances, its author described how, having seen the pageant and caught the London-bound train (benefiting from the convenience of \u2018its modern dining car\u2019), he looked out of the window at the countryside flashing by. The English landscape itself seemed enchanted by the history so arrestingly realised at Sherborne:amid those dim, silent fields, one seemed to see the long processions, the mail-clad knights, the ladies with their gold-embroidered dresses, the mitred prelates and abbots, the monks and the nuns, the courtiers and warriors, and to hear the loud clang of the tocsin which called young and old to the stubborn fight with the Danes. The very fields seemed steeped in a strange glamour, that of vanished life, chivalrous or cloistered, fading at last before the new desire for knowledge which reared the college and the school \u2026 It is well occasionally to go back thus, and \u2026 to recall the unfailing river of our England\u2019s history, broadening on from age to age.[CITATION-141] Of course, pasts other than the medieval were congealed in the landscape of England, and they too supported lineages of English (and British) identity. The remains of Roman occupation\u2014Hadrian\u2019s Wall most obviously\u2014attracted enduring interest over the course of the period, with the archaeological legacy of the legions continuing to prompt reflections about the rise and fall of imperial civilisations. As Martha Vandrei has shown, however, the relationship between this heritage and an imperialised Britishness is less straightforward than sometimes suggested and, in any case, other historical landscapes\u2014and not only those of the Middle Ages\u2014were more obviously insular in orientation.[CITATION-142] For example, versions of a \u2018Merrie England of the Olden Time\u2019 found popularity across the nineteenth and into the twentieth centuries. In its early Victorian iterations, this was often centred on the mansions of Old(e) England (examples of which, thanks to Joseph Nash, could now readily be located in the present-day countryside), and the open-handed benevolence of its squires; one of itswas the beer-soaked Harvest Home.[CITATION-143] Later expressions of \u2018Merrie England\u2019, though still esteeming the half-timbered manor-house, laid more emphasis on communal pleasures and pastimes. A landscape of village greens and Maypoles, it provided an imaginative visual backdrop to theefflorescence of interest in Shakespeare and his times, the related enthusiasm for \u2018Good Queen Bess\u2019, and the cultural patriotism of the folk song and dance revival.[CITATION-144] Still other landscapes might be identified, no doubt, and it is not my intention to deny their bearing either on historical culture or on the construction of English national identity. But I do want to suggest that the landscape of the Middle Ages exerted a purchase that was notably significant, intense and enduring. Its presence was felt across a wide range of cultural and political contexts. As we have seen, these included history-writing and antiquarianism, the politics of land reform, the movement for commons preservation, the practices of tourists and photographers, and the spectacles of historical pageantry. The lineages of Englishness were traced back to the Middle Ages, but not generally beyond them; and engagement with landscape provided a key means\u2014perhapskey means\u2014by which they were traced.Arguably, continuity with the past through the landscape had always been valued (it has been valued, after all, in cultures very different from that of nineteenth-century England, including aboriginal cultures),[CITATION-145] but its stock was now particularly high owing to contemporaneous experience of change. To put it another way, the social, economic, technological and other transformations of modernity had given historical continuity new value as a guarantor of English national identity. Indeed, one might push this point further. The felt intensity of change, and the felt importance of preserving strong links to the distant past, were mutually interdependent. As the anthropologist Marilyn Strathern has written of the relationship between change and continuity: \u2018each depends on the other to demonstrate its effect. Magnifying one is to magnify both\u2019.[CITATION-146] Thus, in nineteenth-century England, the retention of a sense of continuity with the medieval past enabled change to be experienced as change, and the strength of this sense of continuity was positively correlated with the quantum of change experienced. The abiding tangibility of the past in the present was not a defensive reaction to change, but a function of it.This is a more valid perspective than that which opposes pervasive interest in the past, and the medieval past in particular, to the spirit of modernity\u2014that which sees medievalism, as one scholar has put it, as \u2018almost everywhere a movement of nostalgia\u2019 animated by \u2018dread of the modern world\u2019.[CITATION-147] It will not do to suggest, as David Lowenthal has done, that there was a radical sundering of the connections between past and present in Victorian Britain, and that as a consequence \u2018medieval England\u2019 provided an especially potent \u2018antidote to the dreadful present\u2019. Such a \u2018narcotic \u2026 medievalist infatuation\u2019 doubtless existed in elements of English culture, but it was not representative of that culture more generally. And in any case, to recall the still-pertinent observations of Marshall Berman, anxiety about aspects of the present should not be taken to imply any wholesale rejection of the modern.[CITATION-148] Their history congealed in the present-day landscape, the Middle Ages were readily accessible through imaginative agency and possessed of vital contemporary meaning. In an increasingly democratic context, the heritage of the medieval past in the landscape was evidence of the continuity of the institutions of the realm, and in this sense was supportive of dominant \u2018organic\u2019 readings of English constitutional development\u2014readings that owed much to Edmund Burke and the \u2018Whig interpretation\u2019 of history propounded by Macaulay, Stubbs and others, but which were by no means the preserve of political Conservatives.[CITATION-149] Yet, more than this, the presence of the Middle Ages in the landscape of England was evidence of the continuity of the English people themselves. Unlike a royal charter, say, topographical features associated with the Middle Ages\u2014field systems, forests and commons, ruins, buildings, streetscapes\u2014were perceived as collective records of the nation. They had been shaped by many hands, and\u2014now that the nation was popularly defined\u2014they were a newly valuable part of the nation\u2019s heritage.The question as to the extent to which they held this value in later years is beyond the scope of this article, though it is worth sketching an outline answer by way of an epilogue. The unprecedented horror of the Great War\u2014its industrialised, technology-enabled slaughter\u2014did much to sever the felt sense of connection to the medieval past.[CITATION-150] The Middle Ages were less prominent in the inter-war period than they had been in Victorian and Edwardian culture. Their example seemed less practically applicable to the lived realities of the present: in the 1920s and 1930s, there was no equivalent to the Victorian Gothic revival in architecture. But the persistence\u2014and persisting relevance\u2014of the medieval in a variety of modern (and sometimes modern) contexts is nonetheless striking. It was evident in Frank Pick\u2019s work as managing director of the London Underground, the design of war memorials and the plot-lines of films.[CITATION-151] It was also evident in the renewed vitality of the historical pageant movement, which continued to re-enchant present-day landscapes\u2014including those of industrial cities in the north and midlands\u2014through the dramatisation of their associations with the medieval past.[CITATION-152] Perhaps most tellingly, embodied, touristic experience of the English landscape retained considerable value as a means of accessing this past. As much is clear from the content of guidebooks, including the many now produced specifically for that most fashionable class of traveller, the motorist. These laid heavy emphasis on the medieval heritage in the landscape, from the abbeys of Yorkshire to the \u2018delectable and historic land\u2019 of Alfred\u2019s Wessex.[CITATION-153] In line, perhaps, with Saler\u2019s argument about the re-enchantment of English culture more generally, antiquarian detail was less dense than it had been previously, there being now more of an accent on the scope landscape offered for flights of imaginative fancy.[CITATION-154] In some cases, and perhaps especially in guides to the south-west of England and the English border with Wales, this sort of thing shaded towards a hazy mysticism, but the attraction of the medieval nonetheless remained strong.[CITATION-155] Its continued power was exemplified in H.V. Morton\u2019s travelogue writing, most famously(1927). This had much to say in praise of the medieval heritage in the landscape, from stately cathedrals (\u2018the urns which hold the ashes of England\u2019s history\u2019) to humble parish churches; from pre-Reformation streetscapes to \u2018wild moorland, and heavenly dales, unchanged in parts since that time when the first monks went through Northumbria with the first crucifix\u2019.[CITATION-156] Animated by a lambently demotic patriotism, Morton\u2019s books gained an extraordinarily wide readership.[CITATION-157] Indeed, so far as the argument presented here is concerned, their popularity is suggestive. We have seen how, across the Victorian and Edwardian periods, the medieval past was central to the territorialisation of English national memory\u2014and thus to English national identity. It may well be the case that such a conclusion holds equally good until at least the Second World War, and perhaps even beyond."

    "text": "This article discusses community formation at a neighbourhood level from a material-spatial perspective. It argues that a wholesome, safe, \u2018good\u2019 living environment required both social harmony and well-functioning material (infra-) structures. Neighbours\u2019 conflicts, mined from the court records of five cities in the late medieval Low Countries, provide the evidence for two main themes. The first concerns making things, especially houses and their attendant facilities, and the second breaking things: acts of deliberate destruction within living environments, and by implication, breaking communal peace. Neighbours took on diverse roles, among which their more material commitments have remained especially underexplored by historians. Yet the shared use, construction and upkeep of facilities and infrastructure around domestic spaces, which were of high value, had considerable influence on power relations and social interactions. Groups of neighbours participated in legal validation processes and offered physical help to each other, but also policed local social order and bad behaviour. The latter often involved damaging material constructions. Such informal communities thus acted as links to more formalised urban structures and organisations, and as foundations from which the latter could develop. Their interactions with central urban governments were more multidirectional and contested than has often been assumed. Understanding the social-material dynamic at the neighbourhood level therefore reveals an important layer in pre-modern urban politics.On an evening late in November 1446, two men and a woman roamed a neighbourhood in Leiden looking for trouble. They called at \u2018English Maertgen\u2019s place\u2019; when the door remained shut, they attacked it with a knife and threw rocks through the glass windows.[CITATION-1] The group then proceeded towards a nearby city tower and yelled until a housemaid living nearby opened the gate at its foot. One member of the gang claimed that his father \u2018was drying some herring [in the tower] and left a fire unattended underneath\u2019 which they had to put out, \u2018otherwise calamity would come of it\u2019. They entered, sat down and drank through the night.[CITATION-2] Whether they were simply drunk and malicious, as the subsequent court verdict would lead us to believe, or had bones to pick with either inhabitants or officials, this was quintessential bad behaviour. The terms used in the original verdict noted it as such: \u2018quade hantieringe\u2019 and \u2018onstantelike saken\u2019 (\u2018bad deeds\u2019 and \u2018disruptive matters\u2019). Here, as in many similar cases, these terms referred to both disturbance of the peace and deliberate material destruction. The impact on the peace and the significant costs of repairs made acts of vandalism rather grave infractions. Such disruptions were also a physical and literal breaking of public/private boundaries: a transgression of the limits of one\u2019s home and its immediate surroundings, and in this case also a defiance of governmental space.The example points to a fundamental, almost banal opposition. For late medieval townsmen and women, distinguishing between good and evil was not only crucial for establishing the city of God; the dichotomy also pervaded their earthly, quotidian affairs. In northern European cities using Dutch, Flemish and Germanic dialects, the adjectives good (,,) and bad (,) appeared often in court records and could refer to an impressive range of objects, places, people and behaviours. Bad weights and bad meats signalled market (im)morality; bad roads hampered the flow of goods; and bad drainage caused leaks, floods and stench. \u2018Bad taverns\u2019 was a common euphemism for brothels, while \u2018bad deeds\u2019 or \u2018wanderings\u2019 were often-used terms for public disturbances and vandalism. Conversely, a \u2018good stew\u2019 distinguished a decent bathhouse from a brothel; \u2018good men\u2019 designated citizens involved in urban governance, worthy of office, while \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018honourable women\u2019 fulfilled many roles in community life and legal processes. Norms of civic conduct thus distinguished good from bad behaviour and showed what it meant to live as a hardworking, God-fearing and useful member of society. Such members supported the common or public good, as variously formulated by governing elites.[CITATION-3] Bad conduct was the opposite of these things: disruptive and detrimental to the urban civic body.This broadly applicable opposition, as it operated in everyday life, had an important material-spatial component, as this article will show by focusing on what I term urban \u2018living environments\u2019. In the cities under discussion, living environments encompassed clusters of neighbours, their houses and all the spaces that directly surrounded them: streets, alleys, yards and quays, as well as bridges, crossings, docks and even waterways. Such environments thus straddled private property and publicly accessible spaces. They offer an important site for investigations of social relations in practice, especially those relating to safety and communal well-being. These micro-communities did not need a formal organisational structure to exist or function, and could be \u2018good\u2019\u2014that is, thriving, peaceful and wholesome\u2014or bad and \u2018broken\u2019 in multiple ways that medieval residents and local policy-makers did not perceive as categorically different. Nuisance, pollution, deviance, vandalism and disorder were all points on a spectrum of depravity. Such acts were serious transgressions and powerful subversive tools for those seeking to express resistance. Conversely, making, maintaining and mending things, including mending peace between inhabitants\u2014indeed the prevention of breakdown in any such way\u2014were all forms of good works with symbolic and ritual importance in community formation. Constructing bridges and (re-) building churches famously exemplified the symbolic power of social making. A group of neighbours digging and maintaining a well had the same implications, albeit on a smaller scale, but has been given substantially less scholarly consideration.This article seeks to ground neighbourhood social practices in a material and spatial context. It gives a new primacy to the physical complexity of living environments and the high costs and stakes of caring for them, arguing that shared and reciprocal care for material aspects of community life deeply affected socio-political and cultural practices. The importance of this material-social approach is twofold. First, it offers a way to move beyond an institutional perspective on neighbourhoods, which has been the core focus of historiography. Secondly, it offers a new way to explore micro-communities and the function of neighbourliness in a pre-modern context, on which consensus is currently lacking. It seeks the smallest common denominator, so to speak: \u2018the neighbours\u2019 rather than the whole \u2018neighbourhood\u2019.The main thesis here is that the production of a wholesome, safe, \u2018good\u2019 living environment required both social harmony and well-functioning material (infra-) structures. Networks of neighbours formed the basis from which more formalised organisations could develop. Neighbours continuously negotiated their contributions to infrastructures and facilities that were shared with others. Partly because of this material and spatial engagement, they assumed different monitoring tasks and played key roles in the validation of legal processes, as well as in preserving social peace. Local residents acted as witnesses and also confirmed agreements among neighbours on how spaces were used, who could build which kinds of facilities, and who secured certain privileges in using alleys, quays or roads. They made or undermined the reputation of nearby inhabitants, and had the power to establish that something was accurate and true, be it a household\u2019s claim to access a well or the recounting of a violent incident. By taking such diverse validating roles, groups of local residents acted as links between more formal organisations, most notably urban governments, and the local or household level. At the same time, because of that linking function, communities of residents often maintained a certain level of autonomy and self-governance.Understanding the links between material environment and social dynamics at the neighbour level reveals an important layer in urban politics. To date, the main focus of historians has been on the provision of social support and ritual commitments, as discussed in more detail below. This article proposes a next step inspired by the spatial turn and actor\u2013network theory, which has proven influential and productive in many cognate research fields.[CITATION-4] I build on two fundamental premises shared by these approaches. First, that material objects and the spatial environment affect social transformation and interactions in significant ways, and therefore can be considered a type of actor within these processes. Secondly, that power relations are (re-) enacted in heterogeneous networks of humans, materials, animals, objects, spaces, infrastructures, tools and technologies\u2014aspects which historians should therefore try to include when analysing social dynamics.[CITATION-5] Such an assessment of community also augments a recent broadening of notions of citizenship. Focusing on diversity and practices rather than formal privileges, as proposed by, among others, Maarten Prak and Christian Liddy, opens up different perspectives on what civic participation entailedurban communities.[CITATION-6] Similarly, Tom Johnson has argued that \u2018common people\u2019 were routinely involved in both rural and urban legal practices, and through their participation influenced political processes.[CITATION-7] This article\u2019s focus on micro-communities operates in the same spirit, complicating and unpacking the meaning of civic and legal norms for daily lives. To do so, I have chosen an intermediary path between micro-historical and macro socio-economic analysis. While the latter mainly deals with questions of (urban) demographics, social mobility and occupational structures, the former is inspired by anthropological approaches to neighbourhood life. For England, this has generated a rich tradition of community biographies: intensive area studies based on parish administrative records, wills and deeds, and the proceedings of wardmote and leet courts.[CITATION-8] Recently these source types have also been explored using digital tools such as social network analysis.[CITATION-9] Rather than reconstructing relations in one specific place, I focus on processes and types of social interactions that can be recovered for five different cities in the Low Countries during the long fifteenth century: Ghent, Leiden, Deventer, Utrecht and Gouda. Geographically, the selection covers the Netherlandish urban network, which was a remarkably urbanised political and economic configuration, where towns were also in regular communication with each other. All the selected cities had (semi-) independent town governments with princely sovereigns, but differed in size and economic activities\u2014including, most notably, textile industry, beer production, and long-distance trade. This is not to argue, however, that a spatial-material approach is relevant only to this particular region: similar processes probably characterised the production of living environments in cities and towns elsewhere, and continued well into the early modern period.Like many other parts of Europe, the Low Countries were legally pluralistic, with different and at times competing law courts coexisting in the same region. Within this legal landscape, Netherlandish cities developed during the late Middle Ages strong traditions of centralised urban justice. Each town had its own set of privileges, common laws and courts. On one hand, royal or seigniorial authorities were therefore less dominant in assuming jurisdiction over legal conflicts within towns than they were in cities in, for instance, England or France. On the other hand, administrative sub-units within cities such as wards or parishes did not have the same competences and written records as they had in some English and Italian towns.In some Netherlandish towns neighbourhood organisations started to produce documents during the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but the main focus here is on earlier evidence hidden in larger, general series. Court traditions and record-keeping also varied slightly for each city, but there are two important aspects that they had in common and which shed strong light on neighbourhood practices. First, they shared a discourse on neighbourliness that revolved around the notions of harmony and peace versus nuisance. Secondly, each city government was preoccupied with investigating and prosecuting \u2018private\u2019 or \u2018minor\u2019 misdeeds and quarrels, which encompassed an enormous variety of topics.[CITATION-10] The initiative to start legal proceedings commonly came from two directions: from (groups of) inhabitants accusing each other, or from urban officials investigating offences\u2014sometimes after reports or complaints from neighbours. This division betweenandcases was reflected in the keeping of different registers. It resembles the modern legal distinction between civic and criminal law, but did not function in that rigid way. But however they were brought to the attention of authorities, interpersonal quarrels, including those relating to economic transgressions and environmental nuisances, were considered a threat to the public and a breaking of communal peace. This reflected a conception of disorder that radically differed from twenty-first-century views, one that was informed by an organic idea of the city as a body and that closely linked morality to environmental order and physical well-being.[CITATION-11] I start by outlining the scholarly debates on local community formation, and then proceed to discuss why material aspects had such an important and distinctive function, which has to do with the complexity of ownership and the high value of properties and objects within living environments. The core of the article discusses community formation as a continuous negotiation on a spectrum of making and breaking, of good and bad. These practices are grouped around making things, especially houses and their attendant facilities, and breaking things: acts of deliberate destruction within living environments, and by implication, disruptions of domestic social order and peace.To talk productively about community in the context of the highly local and informal neighbourhood clusters in focus here, a few analytical steps are necessary. Community as a concept contains tensions between present and past meanings, and is used on many different yet interconnected scales. I propose a definition that integrates spatiality and materiality, and which functions beyond a rigid distinction between formal and informal collectives. This then helps to uncover some of the complexity of both political and spatial boundaries in practice, a theme which will be addressed in more detail below.That pre-modern townsmen and women had meaningful relations with people living nearby has been widely recognised in the historiography, but debates on what functions those relations fulfilled and how they changed over the long term are far from resolved. There is currently no consensus about pre-modern understandings of local community or neighbourliness, nor are there many studies that attempt a panoramic view of the topic.[CITATION-12] The polarisation in interpretations of neighbourhood life is partly the result of a long-standing linear narrative concerning the erosion of \u2018traditional\u2019 community structures, which was posited in the late nineteenth century. In short, it argues that the rise of the modern state corresponded to the decline of the social and political significance of local collectives within living and work environments, and undermined the solidarity or cohesion of such networks. Macro-factors often mentioned are shifts in the (spatial) organisation of work, the Industrial Revolution, societal commercialisation, and increasing social distance between economic classes.[CITATION-13] Benedict Anderson sparked research on individualisation and constructions of modern identities, while the earlier sociologist Norbert Elias\u2019s theories of civilisation processes in Europe suggested that new ideals of civilised living within the privacy of the household emerged at the expense of public, social and community life in streets, taverns, or salons.[CITATION-14] In these narratives, medieval communities often function as paragons of that traditional image of community cohesion. Some historians have viewed the sharing of social and material care among medieval neighbours as a positive and supportive force: less hierarchical than institutions such as guilds, yet guided by the same Christian principles of fraternal or neighbourly love and charity. This assumes a high degree of communication and stability among neighbour networks. Moreover, some historians have seen the socio-economic heterogeneity of many residential clusters as positive and desirable.[CITATION-15] These networks then dovetailed with notions of community on a city-wide level, forged and sustained by local town governments, especially in the more urbanised regions of the Low Countries and Northern Italy, and with a culture of public civic and religious rituals.These accounts of pre-modern group ties have provoked critical reactions. First, in terms of social bias: the involvement of propertyless (unskilled) labourers in neighbour collectives is hard to estimate. These people have been considered as too mobile during their lives to develop any sentimental attachment to either their dwellings or their neighbours.[CITATION-16] They likewise may have been less interested in protecting possessions through social alliance and litigation\u2014if they had access to the urban law courts in the first place\u2014or in promoting themselves among these local citizens as trustworthy and honourable, which could be helpful in pursuing other economic and political ambitions.[CITATION-17] At any rate, cities needed immigrants: all urban growth was sustained by it, and the social involvement of nearby residents may have been more prominent in larger cities, where distance severed family support networks.[CITATION-18] Secondly, some scholars have emphasised the repressive aspects of medieval neighbourhood life, depicting a fairly unforgiving society, obsessed with reputation. Neighbours produced venomous gossip and at times acted as henchmen for local authorities. From this perspective, domestic environments were sites of routine conflict and violence.[CITATION-19] In short, these various interpretations set up key contradictions, such as that between the grasp of urban governments and the supposed autonomy and self-governance of local neighbours\u2019 communities, and between the strength and stability and the conflictual nature and constant changing of social networks.As in many related fields of historical enquiry, the original linear narratives of local community formation have been substituted by an emphasis on diversity and complexity, both geographically and over time. Neighbourhoods were spheres of reciprocity and moral obligation, with written and unwritten rules and benefits for insiders, and whose strength and impact could vary across periods, generations and different urban areas. Indeed, certain individuals, families, or groups of artisans could reshape networks and therefore change the nature of a local group.[CITATION-20] Such a relative and relational conceptualisation of community, which does not prioritise a certain type of social bond, be it family, occupation, gender, or class, is especially helpful when complemented with a more spatial-material layer. It fits better the reality of larger cities with high levels of mobility, where it was impossible to know everyone within even a certain district or block. Metropoles such as early modern Paris and London diverged in that sense from more face-to-face societies, such as the medieval English villages studied by Barbara Hanawalt.[CITATION-21] On that spectrum, Netherlandish towns, varying from, say, 4,000 to 40,000 inhabitants, fall somewhere in the middle. They contained various scales of community, formal and informal, operating at once. From the twelfth century, the Low Countries developed a particularly strong tradition of urban citizenship (or). Citizenship legally bound inhabitants to a city and in the process defined and established it as a socio-political and economic entity.[CITATION-22] Yet in practice people\u2019s social and political identities were far more complex, quite apart from the fact that they moved or travelled. Inhabitants identified with a county or region, but mostly with a city, town, or village, and within that city maybe also with a specific parish, confraternity, or guild.[CITATION-23] In contrast to some cities in Italy and France, clans of extended families did not dominate patches of urban space in the Low Countries.[CITATION-24] While the micro-community, centred on a part of the street, alley, or courtyard, or on certain water infrastructures, is the scale that is in focus here, it is important to recognise that all these associations were rarely mutually exclusive: they overlapped and reinforced each other. The limited extant evidence makes it virtually impossible to untangle them, or to reconstruct what people saw as their most important or primary unit of community.Within this mosaic of social clusters, there was ample social demand for neighbours\u2019 networks, arrangements and small allegiances.[CITATION-25] Sometimes there was also room for institutionalised versions. In several Netherlandish cities, but clearly not all, more grass-roots initiatives of collectives () gained (semi-) official status alongside centrally implemented administrative divisions such as wards or quarters. They commonly encompassed a small cluster, such as a part of a street. The earliest references to Netherlandishdate from the fourteenth century, while their number, influence and visibility in archival records increase significantly after 1500. Around 1600, for example, Leiden and Ghent both had over two hundred knownand Haarlem about a hundred. Many continued to exist in some form until the end of the.[CITATION-26] The vast majority of studies of these neighbour communities have prioritised their social-cultural aspects. In Holland in particular, the collective commemoration of members\u2019 rites of passage, such as annual feasts and burials, are presented as the core of the\u2019s function and meaning. However, in many cities neighbourhood communities also performed tasks relating to urban sanitation, infrastructural maintenance and fire safety. This is often noted as a matter of fact, without attributing significance to it, or reflecting on its implications.[CITATION-27] An exception are several recent histories of urban public health, which emphasise that the care for and organisation of the material environment were integral to the meaning and function of neighbourhoods.[CITATION-28] Finally, including an informal micro-spatial neighbourhood scale presents a more fragile image of the authority of urban governments. The fact that urban central authorities produced the vast majority of sources dealing with neighbourhood life creates a tricky and often underestimated bias. Urban magistrates issued detailed regulations in ordinances on almost every imaginable aspect of urban life. However, their effective grasp on inhabitants, spaces and practices in cities may have been much more modest in reality. Documents of legal practice attest to the limits of municipal political power, and its need to delegate to and co-ordinate and negotiate with other institutions and with smaller collectives\u2014for example, in order to finance infrastructural works. Such negotiations also make the boundaries between public and private highly complex. For their part, residents were strategically navigating municipal regulations and legal structures in order to resolve their disputes.In sum, instead of a narrative of long-term decline, a more interdisciplinary and spatio-material approach to neighbours, seeing them as operating in dynamic networks and in relation to the needs and challenges of their environments, rehabilitates some of the contingency that longer-established perspectives have often obscured. There is little need to make a rigid distinction between formal and informal collectives, nor to assume a top-down focus on the integration of such neighbourhood structures into processes of state-making. Alliances and clustering of interest groups could, moreover, be temporary and adapt to changing circumstances. Furthermore, as Nicholas Eckstein notes, a material-spatial focus also adds a few historiographical points of contention, namely about planned or unplanned urban space, and perceptions of public and private spheres.[CITATION-29] My intervention into the by now extensive and diffuse debates on these topics questions further the function of dichotomies \u2018on the ground\u2019, and shows the complexity of both spatial and mental boundaries in practice.[CITATION-30] Materiality goes some way to explain neighbour vigilance and gossip, given the porosity of the boundaries separating families and households: thin walls, narrow streets and crowded lodgings.[CITATION-31] In Montaillou, to invoke a well-known example, a curious villager was even able to lift slightly a neighbour\u2019s roof in order to gain a better view of what was happening inside.[CITATION-32] \u2018Neighbour\u2019 (in sixteenth-century Polish often meant subletter: a person or family living in another room in the same house.[CITATION-33] Yet the primacy of the material in either enabling or disabling social boundaries or connections ran much deeper. Since the wave of urbanisation of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a process of physical and social realignment had taken place in many northern European cities, as houses were increasingly arranged alongside streets rather than on plots surrounded by yards. Moreover, the development of stone houses, timber-framed or in many hybrid forms combining building materials, generated new possibilities for dividing houses into separate dwellings and constructing different levels within them. More closely located beside, behind, above and below each other, neighbours thus often shared zones of sound and scent. Even their sight zones overlapped in many respects, as they viewed the same street or courtyard, peeked through windows and shutters, and encountered each other daily at their doorsteps. Neighbours were in that sense integral to domestic space; part of the private.The importance of materiality and proximity in shaping communities can be better understood with some insight into the economic value of properties, objects and (infra-) structures. Today, our daily environments are populated with mass-produced and easily substituted utensils, furniture and building materials. By contrast, not only did most late medieval Netherlandish townspeople own many fewer things than their twenty-first-century descendants, but the price of houses, interiors, (artisanal) tools and facilities such as drainage, sewage and water supply was much higher. This was equally true for repairs and replacements of constructions.[CITATION-34] Some data from fifteenth-century Ghent illustrate the value of things and of real estate in this region and era. In 1477, in a rare public case of self-policing, Ghent\u2019s magistrates convicted the city treasurer, Jan van Melle, of corruption, and proceeded to auction all his possessions. A detailed list of his goods has come down to us, amounting to 37,000 groten Vlaams (d. gr.).[CITATION-35] This was a fortune. The average price of a house in Ghent in this period ranged between 4,000 and 5,000 d. gr., and the most expensive houses cost about 20,000 d. gr. Thus, Van Melle\u2019s inventory alone was worth almost two luxurious houses. Strikingly, a golden necklace with pendant sold at the auction for 5,712 d. gr. and thus equalled in worth a decent house.[CITATION-36] But even Jan van Melle\u2019s eleven tablecloths went for an average of 50 d. gr. each, an amount for which a fifteenth-century Flemish labourer would have had to work about sixteen days.[CITATION-37] An overcoat lined with fur, damask and velvet sold for 1,680 d. gr. to a certain Loy Popelier.By contrast, many townsmen and women were constantly concerned about securing the essentials of food, clothing and shelter.[CITATION-38] For instance, between 1483 and 1493, a certified craftsman in Ghent had to work between twenty-two and thirty-one years to be able to buy an average-priced house of 4,000\u20135,000 d. gr., assuming that people could only reserve 5\u201310 per cent of their income to save up for such a purchase. A servant () would have to work between forty-three and sixty-two years, and a day labourer between fifty-five and seventy-eight years to accumulate enough wealth to buy a medium-sized house. Of course, many cheaper and simpler types of housing existed. But the calculation does demonstrate that the acquisition of real estate was unattainable for the vast majority of inhabitants if they did not previously own or inherit something\u2014especially in years of high inflation and economic recession, of which there were many in the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Low Countries.[CITATION-39] The high value of buildings, things and animals gave a fundamentally different weight to people\u2019s relations with their material and natural environments. This insight has several important implications for the formation of micro-social networks. High costs incentivised those living in proximity to each other to distribute the financial burden of domestic constructions and facilities. Inhabitants often shared gutters or brick walls with neighbours. They also shared latrines, pipes, cesspits and wells. Yet those involved in such interdependent relationships with one or more nearby households also faced certain risks: that others would not contribute as promised, would move away, or otherwise not use spaces according to shared moral norms and principles. Such material commitments therefore required social investments: mutual agreement and trust. This confirms from a new perspective the importance of trust in late medieval urban society, which has been recognised in other contexts.[CITATION-40] Moreover, agreements on material-spatial arrangements also substantially raised interest in policing each other\u2019s behaviour.At the basis of such practical and daily reciprocal commitments were various dramatic developments in the legal status of possessions during the later Middle Ages. In contrast to earlier centuries, houses and land were no longer passed down to younger generations mainly or even exclusively through inheritances; in many towns they could be sold, and therefore became \u2018mobile\u2019 (chattel) instead of \u2018immobile\u2019 goods (patrimony). Even land (and thus also roads, waters and quays) within the city could be mobile in that sense: a form of capital that could be exchanged for other forms of capital, or for rents.[CITATION-41] The urban property market thus evolved from the thirteenth century into a highly regulated but very complex system of exchange, especially in the Low Countries\u2019 growing cities.[CITATION-42] The complexity of exchange was principally the result of the continuous subdivisions, modifications, alterations and sometimes mergers of domestic spaces. It also further complicated the common distinction between owners and tenants, to which we may add partial owners and \u2018users\u2019: those residents who had, for instance, a right of way through an alley, could get rid of rain and waste water through certain pipes, or were entitled to use a water well. In sum, what may have been originally a single plot with one affluent owner or one family\u2014perhaps with tenants\u2014could become over the course of decades and centuries a possession with obligations, rents, annuities, but also practical privileges belonging to several different parties. Living spaces, thus imbued with layers of historical rights and rents, made the private in a pre-modern context less exclusive and individualistic and more conditional and historical. In the words of Vanessa Harding, \u2018contemporaries recognised the simultaneous existence of a plurality of interests in one space\u2019.[CITATION-43] How to make sense of community with these material-spatial and legal complexities in mind? Agreements made between neighbours were a common and legitimate means of keeping the peace, but also a source of conflict. In 1437, for example, a certain Jan Scermer, an inhabitant of Leiden, wanted to rebuild a house over a stream crossing his yard. He pleaded in a case against him, triggered by a neighbour\u2019s complaint, that he had already \u2018peacefully possessed this property for over a third of a century\u2019.[CITATION-44] This reference to long-term \u2018peace\u2019 in relation to the use of a common infrastructure, in this case a waterway, is typical of a claim often asserted in court cases between local residents: that someone had been a good neighbour for a very long time. To come to a resolution, Jan requested instructions on the measurements for his new building project by either \u2018the law or the neighbours\u2019.[CITATION-45] The ambiguity seems curious, but it was not uncommon. City magistrates gave guidance in by-laws and ordinances to avoid friction and hazards. Neighbours\u2019 \u2018customs and easements\u2019 () were often eventually codified in local collections of by-laws during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Yet even by that point, municipal rules were rather general and left much freedom and jurisdiction to neighbours. In fact, they stimulated co-operation among neighbours to avoid issues such as unsafe walls, fire hazards and pollution. Even more importantly, by-laws also formally acknowledged the validity of oral agreements between (groups of) residents.[CITATION-46] Residents at times called on the higher authorities of the aldermen\u2019s courts to resolve their conflicts, or may have used official legal steps as part of their broader strategy.[CITATION-47] Tensions often occurred when someone made extensions or modified existing constructions. Friction was also commonly caused when new owners moved into a property. Such newcomers had to earn their peers\u2019 trust and negotiate their position in an existing socio-material network involving various informal agreements. Furthermore, temporary residents such as lodgers further complicated the composition of households, and may have had limited access to this sphere of reciprocity. In addition to clear financial motives, physical health hazards and issues of safety probably formed part of people\u2019s concerns. The problem of stench as a cause of disease and air corruption () made cleanliness of living environments a matter of public health. A polluted living environment was commonly framed as a type of nuisance that put in jeopardy, as the sources at times explicate, both neighbours and passers-by.[CITATION-48] Men and women initiated legal proceedings against their neighbours and featured as plaintiffs and defendants. The examples below are mainly drawn from Leiden and Deventer, but similaror \u2018civic\u2019 registers are present in many other local archives throughout the Low Countries. Excluding cases about home ownership and rents, in both Leiden and Deventer disputes between neighbours comprise around 10 per cent of the total number of legal disputes.[CITATION-49] In the same registers, neighbours also featured prominently as both litigators and witnesses in numerous financial disputes and conflicts over inheritances, which is another indication of how much nearby residents were tied to each other by systems of credit and debt.[CITATION-50] These court records offer details on practices far beyond what we can find in prescriptive sources. First, the testimonies of others living nearby, and even of former inhabitants of the same house, were crucial in resolving conflicts over ownership and functionality of constructions. Neighbours clearly helped with and informally supervised many construction activities. They were also present when urban authorities performed inspections. For example, when Dirc Aelbrecht challenged local resident Thomas Martijnz in 1477, he boasted that he \u2018could very well testify with many neighbours that the local courtyard belonged to him and him alone\u2019.[CITATION-51] Leiden\u2019s aldermen decided to investigate the matter \u2018by interviewing neighbours and anybody else with expertise\u2019.[CITATION-52] In 1447, the same city recorded that Clais Bechter claimed that he had \u2018together with the neighbours or with their consent\u2019 made a fence. However, after a quarrel over legal boundaries, the fence had to be moved to the place where the sheriff () had hammered a stake, after he inspected and measured the property.[CITATION-53] Although rarely formalised in a way comparable to the English wardmote or leet courts, neighbours\u2019 influence as witnesses attests that they enjoyed considerable authority.[CITATION-54] Nor was this authority clearly spatially delineated: the common appellation here was \u2018the neighbours\u2019. Such groups could populate a cluster of houses, take up part of a street or a waterway, or be circled around a well. They could easily straddle parish or administrative boundaries, as well as socio-economic ones. Neighbours did not need an institution such as thedescribed above to function as a network. Yet these groups were a key reason why such formalised structures could develop.Secondly, neighbours continually tried to push against and (re-) negotiate spatial boundaries, precisely because these boundaries were commonly based on highly local social agreements and traditions. For instance, Leiden\u2019s aldermen\u2019s court documented that the enclosure along a certain water ditch \u2018measured by the neighbours and the surveyor\u2019 became an object of conflict between Heinric and his neighbour Aeght, a widow, in 1436.[CITATION-55] A year earlier, in another case, one Dirk van Leeuwen had to withdraw his claim to half of a ditch \u2018after testimony by the neighbours\u2019.[CITATION-56] A shoemaker lost his case to a widow living next door and had to break down a palisade built too far across the water ditch. The court stated he could carry out the actual replacement with the help of either \u2018workmen or neighbours\u2019.[CITATION-57] These and many other references confirm that neighbours invested much time and energy in collectively creating a functional material environment.Besides demonstrating neighbours\u2019 local political competence in legal validation and material construction processes, recorded conflicts confirm that many types of (infra-) structure were indeed shared between nearby residents, who carried a collective responsibility for them.[CITATION-58] For example, neighbours Clais Buyser and Florijs van Zijl argued about a latrine situated in the yard behind their properties, and which, due to a new fence placed by one of them, could no longer be accessed by the other. While the use and maintenance of the latrine had clearly been shared for a long time, both now claimed to have formal ownership. They did so by means of testimonies of use, but in the end the case\u2019s crux was a written contract, twenty-three years old, belonging to a former owner of Florijs\u2019s house. The aldermen summoned that former owner to court to clarify whether or not he had included the latrine in the sale of the house.[CITATION-59] They then ruled that if the former owner and Florijs both took an oath to confirm the inclusion in the sale, they would win the case. They did.[CITATION-60] Such conflicts display the interconnection between the social and the material that reified good neighbourliness. They at times perhaps concealed deeper tensions with entirely different causes. The Leiden residents Gerijt Jacops and Jan van der Graft had had several altercations about the construction of a drain () by Jan, who built it too close to Gerijt\u2019s house. After the quarrel flared up again at the parish church, the two men appeared in the urban magistrates\u2019 court. Here Jan said he could \u2018prove with stonemasons that he had asked them to make his drain [in a][manner] on his own ground, according to the city\u2019s by-laws\u2019.[CITATION-61] And, he added, it would become clear during inspection how badly Gerijt had constructed his part of the drainage, which overflowed towards his wall during heavy rain. However trivial such feuds may initially appear, it is important to remember how high the stakes were, as the work to rebuild a wall or move a drain, and the required building materials, could be very expensive. The longevity, use and comfort of houses and other constructions depended on the functionality of surrounding constructions such as drains, pipes and cesspits\u2014as did the good relationships between nearby residents. Furthermore, such communal infrastructures were crucial to the maintenance of hygiene and health in a domestic environment, which made health practices also a task negotiated not only between local urban governments and authorities, but among neighbours.[CITATION-62] Infrastructures and facilities also created different kinds of relational ties within residential clusters. One rather complicated account from Deventer is worth discussing at some length because it gives lively insight into such a process, which here involved a religious house, various households, former owners (some even no longer alive), family bonds and artisanal activities. Around 1480, thein Deventer, probably the home of the schoolboys of the Brothers of the Common Life, came into a prolonged conflict with a neighbouring house.[CITATION-63] Because only the witness statements are extant, some details are missing, but it is clear that the dispute concerned the use of a water well and the pathway giving access to it (the), which seems to have been sealed off by a gate.[CITATION-64] No fewer than four witnesses testified under oath as to what they knew about the agreements, which were recorded almost verbatim by a city clerk. The first witness, master Goesen Spronk, said he himself had read a letter of consent belonging to a neighbouring house, which confirmed that thewas \u2018entitled to [use] the passage besides Wolter\u2019s [the litigant] house that led to the Nieuwstraat, and to the well itself\u2019.[CITATION-65] A second witness confirmed this privilege, and added that \u2018when he [the witness] lived there he went around with [a certain] Johan to investigate who had rights to use the well, and that Johan would open the gate\u2019. This witness also remembered \u2018that there was a letter that prescribed that the alley should remain five feet wide\u2019.[CITATION-66] Thus, he concluded, was the situation \u2018when the late Herman Buemij sold the aforesaid house to Wolter\u2019.[CITATION-67] A neighbour, Zweder Hoebrinck, the third witness, then confirmed that the schoolboys\u2019 house had \u2018just as much right to the well as his own house\u2019.[CITATION-68] The final voice recorded was that of a nephew of one of the former owners, who stated that when his uncle used to go through the passage, \u2018he opened and shut the gate as he pleased\u2019. He also recalled that he often joined his uncle when he went to the well, and that on some occasions \u2018he too drew water from it, to help his uncle to temper lime\u2019. The nephew also mentioned that he knew there once had been a letter confirming these rights, but that \u2018he did not know where it was\u2019.[CITATION-69] Besides the fascinating details and depth of investigation, the case displays a curious mix of written and oral types of proof and of local neighbourhood and magistrates\u2019 authority. Neighbours could document their agreements in letters of consent (or), which are also mentioned in many other cases. This may reflect broader changes in the use of documents and written forms of evidence in medieval urban society.[CITATION-70] Gathering sufficient quantitative evidence is difficult, yet the account above suggests that in legal practice oral and written proof merged in various ways. Two witnesses confirmed that they knew that a written confirmation existed, because they had seen the document, had heard it read aloud, or even read it themselves. Another only knew that it hadexisted. However, merely having written proof was rarely sufficient. Urban officials or court representatives investigated mainly by interviewing and taking testimonies. They also traced claims historically; back into time, to former points of friction, and former moments of sale. Often, the only people who had any real expertise in the matter, indeed any memory relating to it, were other nearby long-term residents. Officials then inserted themselves into these sites of dispute with a different, somewhat competing, type of expertise: that of regulations and measurements, and of official, written legal confirmation\u2014and court hearings.What goaded urban authorities to investigate and document neighbour disputes so thoroughly? They had several reasons to do so. Local governments sought to protect the functionality of urban infrastructures. They participated in making constructions as a way of building community. Such actions offered a means of expanding their authority beyond communal or public spaces into living environments. They protected spaces deemed necessary to keep open and accessible to the public: roads, quays, waterways and fortifications. They targeted encroachments such as building extensions, market stalls, stacked merchandise, parked carts and waste.[CITATION-71] Thus, the continuous pushing and renegotiation of boundaries took place between inhabitants and local urban governments as well as between neighbours. Especially foul-smelling structures such as latrines, pigsties and dung heaps were deemed to be both socially transgressive\u2014a breach of civic honour\u2014and health and safety hazards. In that sense, dirt and deviance were in some respects interchangeable, both forms of \u2018matter out of place\u2019, to quote Mary Douglas\u2019s famous adage.[CITATION-72] Town governments invested considerably in public works, building and improving infrastructures, and routinely hired pavers, constructors, surveyors and cleaners. Such investments thus helped to define or determine which places fell under the more direct control of urban authorities. Finally, to avert the threats of fire and smell and sound pollution, and to preserve military safety, magistrates prescribed how inhabitants should build and use their own properties.[CITATION-73] Some of these municipal interventions in urban space are becoming relatively well known. Yet looking at them explicitly in relation to interactions between neighbours shows that this process was less top-down than historians tend to argue or than a superficial reading of the sources may suggest. Urban governments, which generated most of the extant documents on such matters, sought to insert themselves into a complex field of ownership and authority. Furthermore, they claimed that their judgment, documented in writing, was the final say in any matter between residents. However, the fact that some cases dragged on for years suggests that this power was far from uncontested. At times, townspeople did not act upon, or perhaps lacked the resources to act upon, the verdicts issued by the municipal courts. For instance, the record of a neighbours\u2019 dispute concerning a well near the Bisschopsstraat in Deventer noted in the margin that the aldermen issued a verdict in 1479, an additional one in 1481, and, \u2018since the conflict between the parties had continued\u2019, another one in 1482.[CITATION-74] The last-mentioned case exemplifies how the authority of town governments might be contested and even ignored, but also shows that inhabitants employed urban legal instruments to pressure their peers into neighbourly behaviour. Moreover, besides concerns for order, comfort, hygiene and value of properties, gaining a local reputation and performing \u2018civic-mindedness\u2019 through policing living environments offered an opportunity for personal social advancement. This was especially true for ambitious, male, property-owning heads of households. For them, it could be a part of athat would allow them to join the company of \u2018good\u2019 or trustworthy men worthy of municipal office. Indeed, managing one\u2019s living environment meant managing a micro-political community: there was a difference in scale but not in quality compared to taking on central urban governing tasks.[CITATION-75] Moving from ligation initiated by neighbours to cases mainly brought in by representatives of local town governments illuminates a different aspect of neighbourly community-making.[CITATION-76] Local residents were closely involved in reporting crime and vice.[CITATION-77] Many urban governments encouraged such participation and created incentives by formally promising part of the levied fine to accusers for a wide range of offences.[CITATION-78] The role of neighbours in policing social order within their neighbourhoods is fairly well established in studies of urban crime.[CITATION-79] What has remained largely obscured, however, is how such policing efforts related to the shared care for living environments discussed above.Notions of deviance and immorality were clearly tied to material concerns, and destruction of property was a powerful performance of non-conformity. Recent work on Flemish popular politics argues that revolting groups strategically employed acts of vandalism to enforce rebel agendas. Instances of destruction were thus not simply the material side-effect of blind rage. This argument fits into a wider historiographical intervention that views violence in this era as meaningful rather than merely impulsive.[CITATION-80] Moreover, socio-economic historians have paid attention to statistical movements in crimes against property as indications of general levels of prosperity: with more people owning more things, there was more to break and steal.[CITATION-81] Yet local, small-scale destruction was considered a more serious offence than historians often assume. In other words, acts such as trashing doors or windows, taking stones out of streets, or wood from fortifications, were one form of control or action that could be used by less powerful socio-political groups or individuals. These forms of action can also be compared with property confiscation by urban and princely authorities and more large-scale use of destruction in episodes of (popular) revolt.[CITATION-82] This last part of the article foregrounds the aspect of (deliberately) breaking and disrupting things, and relates it to the role and motivation of neighbours in bringing these cases to the attention of authorities, who then proceeded to prosecute offenders.Three examples recorded in the earliest, and remarkably rich, extant register of criminal convictions from the town of Gouda can serve to introduce the various types of prosecution in which breaking things played a role.[CITATION-83] In 1449, two young men went on a little rampage at night, destroying many glass windows of households \u2018with whom they had no previous conflict or any particular reason to do so\u2019.[CITATION-84] In 1490, a man nicknamed Coelpap did seem politically motivated, as he went at night through the streets of Gouda and \u2018smashed glass [windows] while shouting divisive () words\u2019, which declared his allegiance to a political faction.[CITATION-85] At a tavern owned by a county official, Coelpap threw \u2018faeces in the kettle with the meat stew\u2019 and poured himself some beer without permission.[CITATION-86] Finally, about a decade later, a ship\u2019s journeyman named Thonis drank with three other men on his master\u2019s ship until they were drunk, \u2018after which they roamed the streets at night and vandalised the fish containers and tubs, and threw some in the water\u2019. They proceeded to \u2018break windows, and caused major disturbance in the streets by knocking on people\u2019s doors and shouting\u2019.[CITATION-87] Damaging doors and especially throwing objects through or punching in windows seem to have been familiar ways of expressing discontent or taking vengeance. References to such actions appeared rather often in Gouda as well as in the criminal registers of other cities, such as Leiden and Deventer.[CITATION-88] Glass windows were not only an easy target; their destruction also generated for the perpetrators a gratifyingly alarming noise, especially in the silent night. Many convicted offenders had paid unannounced visits after dark to acquaintances, which could be friendly in nature (stopping by for a final drink after the tavern closed) but sometimes turned hostile when quarrels escalated or when residents chose not to open their doors. For instance, a brewer\u2019s servant in Gouda in 1456 attacked the door of a certain Meeus Jacobsz with an axe when he was expelled from that house late in the evening.[CITATION-89] Nocturnal calls could also be taken as opportunities, especially by drunken visitors, to express ongoing grudges or to collect debts.[CITATION-90] Encountering non-responsive hosts gave rise to yelling and other noise that woke up sleeping citizens, but also to violence and vandalism.[CITATION-91] As noted at the beginning of this article, the severe costs of repairs made acts of vandalism serious transgressions. They also involved a deliberate breaking of public/private boundaries, which made such acts comparable to trespassing, a grave offence. Yet few went so far as Gerijt Schoer, who in 1483 pulled a window off its hinges, tore down a door, went inside, hit the lady of the house and a child, and smashed a few more of their items. He claimed to have been severely drunk, and went from Leiden to Rome and back to redeem himself.[CITATION-92] In addition to large fines, punishments commonly contained an element of ritual and religious penance, most often a penal pilgrimage. Gouda\u2019s aldermen sentenced all of the offenders named above to go on such pilgrimages.[CITATION-93] They were a rather common type of punishment meted out by Netherlandish urban governments: a means of eliminating the stain of transgressions against God and therefore of rehabilitating the spiritual health of the urban community. Expiatory pilgrimages offered the secular town governments an opportunity to present themselves as preservers of urban moral order.Urban magistrates described the behaviour of offenders with a set of euphemisms that centred on notions of uselessness and disruption. The actions of Coelpap, who had also shouted politically divisive things and whose unruly behaviour was perhaps strategically motivated, thus fell within the same category as those of the two boys or the group of four drunken men wreaking havoc in Gouda. Such eruptions of violence and vandalism were presented as pointless, yet glimpses of political motives serve as a reminder that they, like the violence against properties seen in revolts, were seldom perpetrated without meaning or intent.Foregrounding the links between social disorder, material aspects and vandalism changes the interpretation of the sizeable category of unspecified breaches of social order found in criminal registers across the region. As with the modern legal category of disorderly conduct, medieval policy-makers often used vague euphemisms for general \u2018disturbances\u2019, commonly formed by a negative prefix (). Leiden\u2019s authorities used terms that can be translated as \u2018disturbances of the peace\u2019 (or), and \u2018bad doings\u2019 (), with no further explanation. Those in Deventer and Gouda framed it as \u2018disruption\u2019 () and \u2018unreasonable deeds\u2019 (), and in Utrecht the preferred term was, also meaning \u2018disturbance\u2019.[CITATION-94] Such characterisations rarely occur in prescriptive sources.[CITATION-95] Terms denoting forms of \u2018useless\u2019 (,) behaviour, undermining the community or harming the public good, were applied to a broad range of offences, including breaking curfew, scolding, brawling, vandalism, streetwalking and public intoxication.[CITATION-96] They thus partly overlapped with the category of physical and verbal assault, yet perpetrators oforprobably did not cause serious (open) wounds or permanent damage to human bodies.[CITATION-97] They are also comparable to, and indeed overlap with, the hugely varied range of misdeeds filed under the legal category of nuisance. One key difference may be that the euphemisms for bad deeds imply a deliberate act or active agents, whereas passivity or neglect\u2014the refusal to act\u2014could be a common cause of nuisance. What characterised the majority of these cases is that they were serious\u2014and taken as such\u2014but they were not mortal sins or crimes against nature, nor did they lead to death or disability. The widespread use of these euphemistic, umbrella terms indicates the pervasiveness of the idea that protecting the community\u2019s communal good meant combating a wide range of misdeeds. Two points are important here. First, these euphemisms described events involving material objects and infrastructures much more often than is commonly assumed. Secondly, they referred to actions that disrupted the local peace or equilibrium of living environments. Whether unrest originated inside a home, spilled from a tavern, or started on the streets, the point was that it disrupted neighbours\u2019 sound and sight zones. Thus, when Stant Dobben, a repeat offender in Leiden, was sent on a pilgrimage to Rome in 1450 for \u2018nuisance and indecent affairs\u2019 on many occasions, the court stressed the damage caused by his actions \u2018especially yesterday in his neighbourhood\u2019.[CITATION-98] Unspecified bad behaviour is a substantial legal category in late medieval Netherlandish criminal records, and can be found in many different cities. Having been up to no good occurred as a listed crime in Utrecht almost 700 times between 1386 and 1455, 15 per cent of the total of noted crimes. Convictions simply noted ascontained many dozens of cases of window-smashing, and a lesser number of trashed doors and roads. Other convictions in Utrecht spoke of irrational deeds and bad wanderings (;).[CITATION-99] In Deventer, between 1476 and 1486, officials recorded 218 offenders in a register of criminal persecutions.[CITATION-100] No fewer than eighty-eight of these cases (40 per cent) were simply characterised as, of which slightly more than half were committed at night. The records only incidentally gave more details. For instance, master Johan van Wossel had been imprisoned because he \u2018had caused unrest () at night and because he fights and argues daily with his neighbours and often creates havoc ()\u2019.[CITATION-101] Less frequent in occurrence but still significant were the sixty-eight cases (8 per cent of the total sample) in Leiden, while forty-two (6 per cent) of offences publicly prosecuted between 1449 and 1558 in Gouda were simply characterised as unruliness or unreasonable deeds. Further information confirms that at times the transgression was mainly an act of vandalism or destruction of material possessions. Jacop IJsbrant, a dyer, banged so hard on someone\u2019s door at night that he punched a hole in it, \u2018which indecent act\u2019, the magistrates added, \u2018would not be tolerated\u2019.[CITATION-102] Another man, also out and about at night, had committed, which here meant that \u2018he pulled out the seats of a number of wagons\u2019.[CITATION-103] Besides vandalism, these euphemisms sometimes concealed what we today would perceive as more serious acts of physical assault, and domestic and sexual violence. A dyer, a horse trader and another man all went on a penal pilgrimage in 1395 (one came back with proof) after they drunkenly committed \u2018a rape and [caused] damage\u2019.[CITATION-104] Here we see an equation between physical and emotional damage to bodies and the destruction of objects. It suggests a fundamentally different perception of the material, and a greater \u2018prestige\u2019 of material possessions within the hierarchy of offences. This is also apparent from the high penalty often issued for theft.[CITATION-105] More metaphorically or associatively, there are many parallels between wounding or \u2018breaking\u2019 the body and destroying possessions and infrastructures. The perception of rape as a form of theft and a tool for social control is a well-known example.[CITATION-106] But wounding someone also meant robbing that person, temporarily or permanently, of the possibility of earning his or her bread, which meant that the victim paid a heavy financial and social penalty. Conversely, non-physical injuries such as sleep deprivation, noise pollution and emotional disturbance were also forms of damage.[CITATION-107] Three types of common offence help further to contextualise notions of deviance in relation to peace and the material stability of living environments, and neighbours\u2019 active roles in preserving that peace and stability: night walking, public intoxication, and illicit sexual encounters. The numerous criminal convictions for nocturnal disturbances confirm that authorities across the Low Countries sought to gain control over streets and neighbourhoods after dark.[CITATION-108] Upholding curfews was clearly perceived as important to communal well-being, yet, as in many other cases, this largely relied on the co-operation of neighbours, who often complained, reported, or acted as witnesses in these cases.[CITATION-109] Furthermore, officials often added \u2018at night\u2019 to the general euphemisms for misbehaviour noted above to indicate the increased seriousness of the crime. For instance, forty-three cases from a total of 879 gathered in Leiden mention night-time. In Deventer, the number is considerably higher: sixty-four of the total of 218 offences prosecuted between 1476 and 1486 were committed at night.[CITATION-110] Concerns about nocturnal vandalism may also have been heightened because of the greater risk at night of causing damage and the inability to (immediately) repair things, besides the fact that the cloak of darkness hid the identity of perpetrators and made their destructive actions harder precisely to observe\u2014and therefore bring to justice.Closely related to nocturnal disorder, and with an increased risk of breaking things, was public intoxication. Just \u2018being drunk in public at night\u2019 would be a sufficient reason for incarceration, temporary banishment, or a penal pilgrimage.[CITATION-111] Male inhabitants were convicted for offences committed while under the influence of alcohol ranging from drunken brawls in taverns,[CITATION-112] feuds,[CITATION-113] blasphemy,[CITATION-114] trespassing,[CITATION-115] and participating in the night watch,[CITATION-116] to domestic violence,[CITATION-117] theft,[CITATION-118] and insulting officials.[CITATION-119] Two men creatively combined elements of bad conduct, as they went out on the streets of Leiden \u2018long after curfew while being drunk \u2026 and robbed the night guard of his clapper and clapped with it\u2019, continuing their tour and damaging several houses.[CITATION-120] Finally, both officialdom and neighbours aimed to detect disturbances and nuisance caused by sexual misdemeanours such as (illicit) prostitution and adultery.[CITATION-121] However, this category was also broader and more fluid than it would appear at first sight. Often, concerns about customers creating disturbances in a neighbourhood were greater than anxieties about the moral stain caused by the presence of sexually promiscuous women. Conversely, women in particular sometimes relied on neighbours\u2019 protection in case of domestic violence, or could successfully mobilise them to provide legal assistance.[CITATION-122] Protecting \u2018good women\u2019 was part of preserving an orderly and reputable living environment. For instance, a certain Willem Wiggers in 1477 assaulted a house in Leiden at night with three companions, as they were looking for two girls living there, again an example of offenders transposing aggression against persons to the material constructions surrounding them\u2014or of a prioritisation of material damage when describing the offence. The girls in question reported the incident to the authorities, with the \u2018neighbours testifying that they were not of ill repute ()\u2019.[CITATION-123] In sum, while officials made their inspections, citizens participated in policing not only through urban militias and night watches, but also by acting as complainants in criminal cases. Townsmen and women thus strategically used governmental structures to secure peace and safety in their living environments.[CITATION-124] Conversely, they could also intervene in favour of a defendant and thus have considerable influence in the outcome of a court ruling, especially since public reputation was so crucial and testimonies were one key instrument to attest one\u2019s good.[CITATION-125] As noted above, policing civic conduct was also a way of performing it for local peers and thereby forging or sustaining one\u2019s embeddedness in a social network. Enforcing public morality was therefore not a unidirectional or exclusively top-down process, and was intertwined with material viability, safety and stability.In order to secure safety, prosperity and peace, neighbourhoods required both social harmony and well-functioning (infra-) structures. Only then could they attain a label of wholesome and \u2018good\u2019, and be fully distinguished from \u2018bad\u2019 neighbourhoods, made broken and dysfunctional through disruptive deeds. Such deeds, whether altering constructions or creating unrest by breaking or disturbing things, can be found in considerable numbers in legal documents. Their presence in written records suggests that negotiating material infrastructures and prosecuting (material) conflict at a local or micro-level, expressed in a discourse of nuisance and damage, was not considered trivial but was taken seriously by both residents themselves and by urban central authorities, who performed thorough investigations. This confirms a much closer link between materiality, environment and morality than modern sensibilities would initially assume. A good citizen was a good neighbour, and contributed to communal interests by putting in his or her share of good works.Researching this micro-local scale from a material perspective offers several important insights into processes of urban community formation. The approach taken here, of reviewing practices from multiple cities and sampling series of records, helps to establish general trends. The evidence suggests that the connections between belonging and belongings applied across the later medieval period. Yet studying specific cases may further highlight diversity and changes over time. One under-researched factor creating such differences, for example, may have been the requirements of specific topographies, such as water flows. What is clear, however, is that sharing the use, construction and upkeep of facilities and infrastructures around domestic spaces had considerable influence on power relations. Ties between governments and inhabitants were more multidirectional and contested than has often been assumed, and neighbours as collectives maintained a certain level of authority and autonomy. They formed a link between urban institutions and the household. There is an apparent paradox in the dedication of local authorities to regulating and persecuting a wide range of material and social misdeeds, and the relative autonomy assigned to groups of neighbours. Respect for customs and private property, and a reluctance to take on costs for maintenance that centralisation would imply, were probably factors in this. Yet there was also an underlying assumption that living environments, and all the attendant individuals to be found within such clusters, fitted within the urban body politic as an integral part of a dynamic and ideally harmonious whole."

    "text": "William Tennent (1759\u20131832) was a successful businessman and banker, who made his mark in Belfast as one of the city\u2019s richest men. He was also a father and, later, a husband. By the time of his marriage in March 1805, Tennent had fathered at least thirteen illegitimate children, with at least four women. The child he would have with his wife, a daughter named Letitia, would be his only legitimate heir. Through this series of illicit sexual relationships, William Tennent created a complex family unit that consisted of legitimate and illegitimate children, half-siblings, step-siblings and step-parents, all of whom were united through a network of unmarried mothers. The example of the Tennent family therefore offers historians the unique opportunity not only to extend knowledge about the making of the family in Ireland, but also to refine ideas about contemporary attitudes to illegitimacy. Using the Tennents as a case-study, this article furthers understanding of the family in Ireland by considering the horizontal relationships which characterised family life, drawing attention to how legitimacy, as well as gender, social rank and birth order, shaped ties between parents and children, and between siblings.In February 1805, Anne Henry wrote a letter to her lover, William Tennent, in which she begged him not to forget their children. Heavily pregnant with their sixth child, Anne had just heard news that William was due to be married the following month to a woman named Eleanor Jackson. Worried that the marriage would alter William\u2019s sense of paternal duty, she outlined her hopes that Eleanor would \u2018adopt [the children] as her owne\u2019 and warned him to be mindful that \u2018Marage will make a change with them all \u2026 When you get another famely they will be but distant to you\u2019.[CITATION-1] The \u2018famely\u2019 that Anne referred to in her letters was much larger and more complex than we might imagine. Anne was not William\u2019s only lover, nor was she the only woman to give birth to his children. Before marrying Eleanor Jackson in March 1805 at the age of 46, William had fathered at least thirteen illegitimate children with multiple women. The child he would have with his wife, a daughter named Letitia Joy, would be his only legitimate heir. Born out of a series of illicit sexual relationships and bound together in a tangled web of family connections, the Tennents offer an alternative insight into the making of the Irish family.Research on the family in Ireland has steadily grown in recent years\u2014a development that owes much to the work of scholars of women\u2019s history.[CITATION-2] A rich body of scholarship now exists that enhances our knowledge of the family and the life-cycle in Ireland, including childbirth and childhood, reproduction, marriage, divorce and sexuality.[CITATION-3] Despite these efforts, there is still much to be done. Looking outside Ireland, historical studies of the family are taking new and exciting directions. Two significant developments are notable. On the one hand, scholars in Britain, Europe and North America have deepened understandings of the family by expanding their assessments to include horizontal relationships between family members, including siblings, step-siblings and half-siblings.[CITATION-4] These methods have not yet been extensively applied by Irish historians, whose work remains largely focused on the vertical relationships between parents and children, and those between husbands and wives.[CITATION-5] That this wider aspect of the Irish family has been largely neglected is puzzling when we consider the rich diversity of Irish households, particularly in rural farming areas. Valerie Morgan and William Macafee\u2019s study of Irish households and family size in county Antrim, for example, found that it was not uncommon for households to be shared with relatives such as unmarried siblings and grandchildren. Indeed, between one-quarter and one-third of households in their sample contained family members outside of the apparently typical two-generation unit of parent(s) and children.[CITATION-6] Scholarly understandings of the family and its relationships have also been reinvigorated by new and emerging scholarship that has reassessed the role that illegitimacy played in defining the family and shaping its dynamics. Scholars of the family in Britain and Europe have begun to unpick how concepts of legitimacy shaped the experiences of children and their relationships with their siblings and parents. Katie Barclay has recently highlighted the important role that legitimacy played in determining both the level and form of care that children experienced in eighteenth-century Scotland.[CITATION-7] Considered as \u2018dispersed parenting\u2019, Barclay demonstrates how the care of illegitimate children was shared across different households and provided by various caregivers.[CITATION-8] Writing on early modern Spain, Grace Coolidge has likewise shown that the care of illegitimate children in elite families was not only shared among the kin network but also that individual experiences varied according to family interests and circumstances.[CITATION-9] Kate Gibson\u2019s work on England has similarly revealed how sibling relationships were shaped by concepts of legitimacy. Whereas full siblings were tied together by the bonds of shared family interests and material inheritance, illegitimate children were dependent on \u2018shared upbringing, emotional attachment and personal amity\u2019 to secure their place in the family.[CITATION-10] Research on these themes is also beginning to emerge among scholars of Wales, pioneered by the work of Angela Joy Muir on illegitimacy, courtship and the making of marriage.[CITATION-11] These approaches have not yet been applied to Ireland. Much of what has been written on illegitimacy in an Irish context focuses on the challenges it posed to family life and the values of Irish society more broadly. It is true that illegitimacy was not experienced equally across Irish society. Wider factors, such as gender, social rank and religion, shaped Irish attitudes. Indeed, it is at the intersections of these factors that the detrimental effects of illegitimacy were felt most sharply. Poor, unmarried women and their children, living in predominantly Catholic (and rural) communities, fared worst. Moreover, it is generally agreed that attitudes to premarital sex and illegitimacy hardened from the early twentieth century onwards, resulting in the increasing use of institutions to \u2018deal\u2019 with the \u2018problem\u2019 of unmarried mothers. Irish historians have subsequently produced a rich body of scholarship that sheds light on the consequences of illicit sexual behaviour for this section of Irish society.[CITATION-12] Recent research by Maria Luddy and Mary O\u2019Dowd has significantly revised the view that rates of illegitimacy were low in Ireland in comparison to its British and European neighbours. They have argued that premarital sex was not uncommon across all of Ireland\u2019s main denominations throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, suggesting that at least 10 per cent of brides may have been pregnant.[CITATION-13] That premarital sex was commonplace in Ireland is likewise suggested by the comparatively high levels of infanticide recorded across the island. As the work of Elaine Farrell and James Kelly has demonstrated, infanticide was often employed as a response to unwanted pregnancy.[CITATION-14] The infant murder rate in Ireland outstripped that recorded in England for much of the late nineteenth century, with approximately 85 per cent of murdered infants classed as illegitimate in Ireland between 1850 and 1900.[CITATION-15] Experiences of Irish illegitimacy were further complicated by the intersections of gender, social rank and religion. A number of histories of sexuality and marriage have pointed to examples of individuals whose lives were lived outside the mainstream and whose social and gender privileges meant that their \u2018deviancies\u2019 were largely tolerated by those around them. As in Britain, it was not uncommon for Irish men of the landed classes to maintain mistresses and their illegitimate children. Anthony Malcomson\u2019s work, for example, has revealed how the keeping of mistresses was widespread among Irish noblemen. Many aristocrats paid their mistresses good annuities, left provision for their illegitimate children in wills, and ensured they received a good education and made good marriages. Indeed, so long as these relationships were kept out of public view, mistresses were maintained and any children provided for, such alliances were tolerated.[CITATION-16] Religion also complicated attitudes to Irish illegitimacy. My own work on Ireland\u2019s Presbyterian community has brought to light the blurred boundaries between licit and illicit sexual behaviour. Many Presbyterian couples engaged in sexual activity during courtship, and some participated in sexual intercourse as they moved towards marriage. Under such circumstances, sex for these couples was not engaged in illicitly. As long as they married afterwards, the community were largely tolerant of any children born as a result.[CITATION-17] That such behaviour cut across confessional lines has been recently highlighted by Luddy and O\u2019Dowd in their ground-breaking study of marriage in Ireland. As they remind us, there are important \u2018contradictions between public rhetoric on sexual morality and the private lives of individuals\u2019.[CITATION-18] Illicit sexual practices were just some of the driving forces that bound and blended families together in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Ireland. While families reconstituted in these ways went against accepted norms, they were not uncommon. Illegitimacy did play a role, albeit an unsanctioned one, in the making of the Irish family.Drawing on the Tennents as a case-study, this article highlights the role that illegitimacy played in the making of the Irish family, offering a more nuanced reading of the operation of shame and stigma in Irish society. Factors such as gender, birth order, social rank and even favouritism contributed to the emotional and economic quality of family life experienced by both illegitimate and legitimate children. It also extends our understandings of Irish parenthood. The abilities of Irish women and men to parent their illegitimate children and fulfil the emotional and practical performances of their parental roles were likewise sensitive to multiple factors and forces. The article begins by providing background on the Tennent family, and attempts to recreate the lives of the mothers of illegitimate children who were central to its creation. It then moves on to consider what the Tennent family can tell us more broadly about the lives of illegitimate children and their parents in Irish families during the period. Finally, it considers how illegitimacy shaped relationships between siblings.In order to unravel the complicated story of the Tennent family, we must turn to the records of the man at its centre, William Tennent (1759\u20131832). William left behind a substantial archive, made up of correspondence, diaries, account books, letter-books and miscellaneous notes. Incorporated within the wider Tennent family archive, which was arranged and preserved by William\u2019s nephew, Robert James, and his son-in-law, James Emerson Tennent, the collection contains more than 9,000 items. The Tennent archive is an invaluable source for Irish historians and has been the subject of a number of monographs and articles.[CITATION-19] Born in County Antrim on 26 June 1759, William Tennent was the eldest son of the Reverend John Tennent, a Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Ann Patton. As the son of a minister, William grew up in a family of relatively modest means. His father\u2019s income amounted to no more than \u00a370 per annum.[CITATION-20] In spite of these humble origins, William Tennent is a familiar figure to Irish historians. Much is known about him, partly because his life story is one of meteoric success. After serving a failed apprenticeship in Scotland, William returned to Belfast where he made his fortune as a merchant and trader.[CITATION-21] Taking advantage of the emergence of Belfast as a hub of economic activity, he became involved in a number of lucrative businesses, including wine, insurance, sugar and banking.[CITATION-22] By 1809 he was said to be worth in excess of \u00a380,000 and was one of Belfast\u2019s richest men.[CITATION-23] William is also well-known among Irish historians for his links with political radicalism. In 1798, he was arrested and subsequently imprisoned for his suspected involvement with the United Irishmen\u2014a revolutionary society responsible for the failed Irish Rebellion of that year.[CITATION-24] Aside from his guises as a political revolutionary and successful businessman, William was also a father and, later, a husband. From his correspondence, we can estimate that William fathered at least thirteen illegitimate children, eleven of whom survived infancy. Unfortunately, the dates of birth of the majority of these children are not clear. There is no surviving record of their births in the archive, and we only know about the deaths of two of the children because of a brief reference to them in a letter written by one of their mothers.[CITATION-25] Most of the children appear to have been conceived in the 1780s and 1790s when William was in his late thirties. The mother of Jane, Isabella, Robert, Edward, Charles John and Theresa appears to have been Anne Henry; the mother of George, William and Ann (Nancy) is likely to have been the woman referred to only as a \u2018Scottish\u2019 woman in the letters; Franklin, Octavia and Henry were probably the children of Margaret McCabe; and the mother of Catherine cannot be identified.Identifying the different mothers of these thirteen children is no easy task, and often snippets of information have to be pieced together from various letters in the Tennent archive to do so. For example, that George, William and Nancy shared a mother who lived in Scotland can be deduced from a number of different letters. In November 1804, Anne Henry wrote to William to let him know that William Junior had received a letter from his mother which noted that his sister Nancy had been taken to a boarding school in Glasgow, which would cost 50 guineas per annum.[CITATION-26] The shared bond between the three siblings is further suggested in another letter from Anne, in which she entreated William to help pay his son, William Junior\u2019s, debts. Anne mentions in this letter that she was not William\u2019s mother, remarking that if he were she would pay the money herself.[CITATION-27] She also makes the sibling connection between the three children clear, noting that they had all shared a home provided by a man named Billy.[CITATION-28] That Margaret McCabe was the mother of Octavia, Franklin and Henry can likewise be inferred. Margaret often wrote about her interactions with her children and how much she missed them, making explicit references to Octavia and Franklin, and her grief at the latter\u2019s death in 1828.[CITATION-29] Henry\u2019s connection to Margaret can be deduced from letters he wrote to his father requesting money towards his mother\u2019s rent, which was owed to her sister (and his aunt) Mary.[CITATION-30] The relationship between Anne Henry and the remaining six children is easier to establish since more of their letters have survived. We know that two of Anne\u2019s children with William\u2014Charles John and Edward\u2014died in infancy because she refers to their illnesses and funeral arrangements in the first surviving letter.[CITATION-31] Subsequent letters make explicit reference to her desire to keep her children, including Isabella, Robert and Jane, in her sole care as long as possible.[CITATION-32] It is further likely that the child Anne mentions being pregnant with in February 1805 was Theresa, who appears to have been her last child.[CITATION-33] Not much is known about the lives of these women, nor do we know a great deal about the emotional quality of their relationships with William. Of the four possible mothers, only the letters of Anne Henry and Margaret McCabe have survived. While these letters are invaluable for what they tell us about illegitimacy and motherhood, it should be noted that the correspondence series are probably incomplete. There are twenty letters from Anne Henry to William Tennent, eleven dating from the period 1804\u20135, five from 1817\u201321 and four which are undated.[CITATION-34] Thirteen letters from Margaret McCabe also survive: three are undated, one was written in 1819, one in 1822 and eight in 1828\u20139.[CITATION-35] Unfortunately, there are no surviving letters from William to these women. We can, however, partly access William\u2019s expressions, thoughts and actions through the responses of his correspondents.In contrast to his political and economic adventures, this aspect of William Tennent\u2019s life has received comparatively little attention. The fullest engagement with the \u2018unconventional\u2019 Tennents can be found in Jonathan Wright\u2019s study of nineteenth-century Belfast, which uses the family as a prism through which to chart the development of the city\u2019s political, social and cultural life.[CITATION-36] Interestingly, Wright speculates that William\u2019s \u2018sizeable brood of illegitimate children\u2019 can perhaps be seen as an outward manifestation of his political radicalism.[CITATION-37] Yet, unlike his contemporaries, who were \u2018conflicted and deeply ashamed\u2019 of their liaisons, William made no attempt to hide his indiscretions.[CITATION-38] Commenting on William\u2019s willingness both to recognise and to provide financially for all of his illegitimate children, Wright notes that it bears the hallmarks of the \u2018rebelliousness and independence of mind\u2019 of Ulster\u2019s Presbyterian radicals.[CITATION-39] More recently, William\u2019s relationships with the mothers of his children has been subject of work by O\u2019Dowd and Luddy. Reflecting on the experience of Anne Henry in particular as a \u2018kept woman\u2019, they shed light on the strained and emotionally charged relationships between William and the mothers of his children.[CITATION-40] This article extends these approaches by considering what the Tennents can tell us about the role that illegitimacy played in the making of the Irish family and the shaping of their dynamics. The Tennents were a complex family unit, consisting of legitimate and illegitimate children, half-siblings, step-siblings and step-parents, all of whom were united through a network of unmarried mothers. It is this that makes the family worthy of such close study. As their example demonstrates, families in Ireland were not only more complex than we might imagine, they could also be constructed in many different ways. The Tennents therefore offer Irish historians the opportunity to complicate our understandings of the family, sexuality and illegitimacy.The twenty surviving letters from Anne Henry to William Tennent offer a remarkable insight into the mothering experience of a \u2018kept\u2019 woman in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Ireland. We cannot be sure where, when or how Anne and William first met. The letters are frustratingly silent on this aspect of their relationship. Luddy and O\u2019Dowd\u2019s suggestion that the pair met sometime before William\u2019s imprisonment in 1798 seems probable.[CITATION-41] In a letter to William in February 1805, for example, Anne made reference to his imprisonment as \u2018the greatest tryal\u2019 she had ever met.[CITATION-42] Using Anne\u2019s correspondence as a guide, we can estimate that the pair maintained their relationship for over thirty years.[CITATION-43] They were also sexually intimate for a considerable period of that time. Anne gave birth to at least six of William\u2019s children between the mid-1790s and the early 1800s. When she wrote the letter that opened this article in February 1805, Anne was heavily pregnant with what was probably their last child together.[CITATION-44] Although William\u2019s replies are not extant, the length of their acquaintance does suggest that their relationship was more than a passing fling. Moreover, William not only kept Anne\u2019s letters, but the content of her missives reveals that the pair were once in a passionate relationship, which (in Anne\u2019s mind) could have led to marriage. In a letter from February 1805, for example, Anne remarked that \u2018there was a time\u2019 when William had told her that she \u2018had the power to prevent [him] from ever marrying\u2019.[CITATION-45] Like many other women in her situation, Anne\u2019s livelihood was dependent on her relationship. Indeed, that Anne was acutely aware of this is indicated by her self-styling as a \u2018cept\u2019 woman in the correspondence.[CITATION-46] The letters reveal that Anne lived in a house in Belfast, which she shared with her own mother and a number of the children. William also stayed at the Belfast house on occasion, as did his youngest brother, Samuel.[CITATION-47] When William announced his intention to marry Eleanor Jackson, Anne was instructed to leave the house in Belfast and relocate to one that he had been building elsewhere in the city. The letters indicate that William proposed providing Anne with furniture for the new house, including a new bedstead, curtains and linens.[CITATION-48] In addition to providing housing, William also gave Anne an allowance of 30 guineas per month, an amount that was to be reduced to an annuity of thirty pounds per annum after his marriage.[CITATION-49] Anne was unhappy with this change and worried that the reduction was but a \u2018small income\u2019 to support herself and the children.[CITATION-50] She reminded William of her financial obligations, explaining that she had \u2018not saved more than 10 guineas\u2019 because she paid for the childrens\u2019 clothing and other necessities out of her allowance.[CITATION-51] While being a kept mistress placed women in a precarious financial situation, Anne appears to have been luckier than many. In a letter dated February 1821, she told William that she was in bad health and spelled out her wishes for the children. The letter outlined her financial situation and it suggests that she was at least in comfortable circumstances. In addition to a house on Gordon Street, Belfast, that brought in an income of \u00a347 16per annum, she had in her possession a sum of \u00a3202 63, which she directed to be split evenly among her four surviving children.[CITATION-52] Anne\u2019s letters also shed light on how society in nineteenth-century Belfast viewed women who lived as kept mistresses. As noted by Luddy and O\u2019Dowd, Anne describes a secret and hidden life, and she felt the shame of unmarried motherhood.[CITATION-53] Anne told William how she was \u2018always asheamed to go out\u2019 both when she was \u2018with Child\u2019 and after childbirth, and when she did venture out, she chose to do so at the \u2018best time for not being observed\u2019.[CITATION-54] When William announced his intentions to marry, Anne\u2019s fears appear to have increased. She lamented that the marriage meant she would lose \u2018her protector\u2019, and her letters indicate that she feared moving out of the house would open herself (and her mother) to the scorn of the world:I never was fond of going out & I think I will be more backward now than ever to be seen & I know my mother wont go out if she can help it. you w[oul]d be sorry to look at her what truble have I brought on the best of mothers. this tryal is next to your Death for now we part for ever \u2026 I do not intend to work for any person at my Dread for I think it w[oul]d put me in too publick a way of Life. With whatever you are pleased to give me I will live as quietly as posable.[CITATION-55] Conscious that she was at risk of losing social and financial protection, Anne appealed to William\u2019s sense of duty. The assumption on Anne\u2019s part was that the pair could never again see one another after he married.[CITATION-56] Whether they kept in direct contact during Tennent\u2019s marriage is unclear. The correspondence ends one month before William\u2019s marriage in February 1805 and does not resume until August 1817. Correspondence between William and his wife suggests that they had a happy, albeit brief, marriage.[CITATION-57] It is clear from Anne\u2019s surviving letters, however, that she and William rekindled their relationship after Eleanor\u2019s death in 1807. While they do not appear to have lived together again, William continued to send Anne gifts of flowers, vegetables and furniture, and the pair arranged secret meetings, apparently against the wishes of their families.[CITATION-58] While the letters between Anne and William hint that the pair maintained some sort of intimate and amicable acquaintance, those from Margaret do not. Her thirteen surviving letters bring into sharper focus the financial hardships and social isolation that being an \u2018out of favour\u2019 kept woman involved. Like the kept mistresses studied by Katie Barclay in nineteenth-century Scotland, Margaret lived in a state of \u2018genteel poverty\u2019.[CITATION-59] Anxious to maintain a \u2018respectable\u2019 existence, Margaret frequently pleaded for larger sums of money to keep her housed, clothed and fed. On a number of occasions, she stated that she simply could not afford to live on the \u00a320 per annum allowance that William provided and asked for an increase to \u00a330 per annum.[CITATION-60] Totting up her spending, she lamented that she had \u2018very little to live upon\u2019 and stressed that her \u2018living cannot be expected to be very sumptuous\u2019, paying out of her allowance her breakfast, dinner and supper, \u00a34 per year for her room and \u00a33 for turf to heat her home.[CITATION-61] Other letters explained that she needed extra money for essential items of clothing. In March 1822, for example, Margaret wrote that she was \u2018so Bare of wearing appearls\u2019 and lacked \u2018all that that a Woman would stand in need of\u2019.[CITATION-62] William refused to increase the allowance and made a number of smallerpayments instead: \u00a32 in December 1819, \u00a35 in May 1828, \u00a35 in December 1828.[CITATION-63] Throughout her life, Margaret relied heavily on others for support, both financial and emotional. When her letters began, Margaret was renting a room from her sister in Belfast; she resided in Randalstown with her daughter (not related to William) and son-in-law for a time during the 1820s; and later in life she relied on the goodwill of her nephew, Job Charleton, who often wrote to William for financial assistance to help keep his aunt in bed and board.[CITATION-64] The children she shared with William likewise made intercessions on her behalf.[CITATION-65] Unlike his relationship with Anne, William does not appear to have made much effort to reconnect with Margaret. Indeed, Margaret seems to have been quite aware that he preferred to keep his distance. Coming back to Belfast in March 1829 because she \u2018had not one peney\u2019, Margaret wrote to tell him she had arrived in town and had sent her letter by post \u2018as [she] did not like to call at [his] own house\u2019.[CITATION-66] Her uneasiness can perhaps be explained by the hostile reception she received on the one occasion she did visit William at home uninvited. In an undated letter, Margaret expressed her surprise to find him \u2018fly in such a Passion at seeing\u2019 her. Her explanation for the bold move demonstrates the precarious situation of the kept woman:\u2026you are all I have left in this world to go to in such a Case \u2026 Since I came home from Belfast I had not the one halfpenny to get the smallest morsel of food for my self \u2026 My sister has stopped giving me any thing except a peck of Meal now and then. I am in debt 2\u00a3 to another shop Next Door for goods \u2026 I am in debt to my sister Rose thirty shilling for the Rent of the Room wee live in an 1\u00a3 for Milk. I believe it is about 10\u00a3s in all indeed Mr Tennent there is no person on earth could do with less than I Did and I could not keep all this out of Debt.[CITATION-67] While William was loath to send Margaret larger sums of money, he did make provision for her in his will. His daughter Jane (whose mother was Anne Henry) was directed to pay Margaret \u00a360 per annum (paid in half yearly amounts of \u00a330) out of the rents she received for his estates at Sligo.[CITATION-68] William\u2019s relationships with Anne and Margaret are difficult to reconstruct because we can only work from the fragments of the surviving letters. Yet we can draw some broad conclusions. Both women were apparently cognisant of the dangers that went with being a kept woman. They each relied on William for financial support, and also on his good will in times of distress. Both women were acutely aware of how women in their situation were regarded by wider nineteenth-century society. Their respective desires to shy away from society, and to maintain as respectable appearance as possible if they had to be seen in public, illustrate the stigma and shame that accompanied the \u2018kept\u2019 woman. The letters also suggest that William showed a preference for Anne over Margaret: she received a larger annuity; he rekindled their relationship after the death of Eleanor; and Anne appears to have maintained an intimate connection with all of the children, irrespective of maternal ties. The reasons for this will never be known. While it is possible that William did in fact have feelings for Anne, it also notable that Margaret, unlike Anne, appears to have had relationships with other men. Margaret\u2019s letters make reference to her daughter, Sarah, who was no relation to William. Frequent requests for financial assistance for Sarah were not always received favourably by William, who did not consider himself bound to offer support.[CITATION-69] It is possible that this explains William\u2019s preference for Anne. In a letter to his uncle Robert, William Junior even complained that his father treated Anne Henry more kindly than he did his own mother.[CITATION-70] Decisions about how to raise illegitimate children were shaped by the intersecting factors of gender, social rank and marital status. Historians of England and Scotland have noted how the abilities of unmarried women to mother their illegitimate children were circumscribed by their socio-economic status. Poorer women who made a living as servants left their children with grandparents and kin, and those who were unable to access these support networks turned to solutions offered by the parish, or to abandonment.[CITATION-71] Across the social spectrum, the fathers of illegitimate children were unlikely to take on primary caring roles. It is well established that parish authorities demonstrated a cultural and economic preference for children of the poorer sorts to remain with their mothers.[CITATION-72] The same was true for men from the middling orders and above, who were more inclined to meet the financial obligations of unmarried parenthood than they were to provide emotional care.[CITATION-73] Studies of illegitimate parenthood in Ireland largely confirm these conclusions. Whereas poorer women in Ireland experienced social marginalisation and turned to institutions established for \u2018unwanted\u2019 children, there were many examples of men belonging to the social elite who went to great lengths to meet the economic and practical demands of paternity.[CITATION-74] How illegitimate parenthood was negotiated among the middling orders in Ireland has been much less studied. And yet, as Kate Gibson\u2019s pioneering work on England has revealed, the negotiations that took place over the care of children conceived in upper middling families provide new insights into the relationship between parenthood and illegitimacy.[CITATION-75] The Tennent family provide Irish historians with the opportunity to explore this area further, adding a new layer to our understanding of how illegitimacy shaped parenting practices and strategies.Making sense of William Tennent\u2019s unconventional approach to fatherhood is challenging. For Wright, the fact that William acknowledged all of his illegitimate children and provided for them and their mothers, demonstrates that he \u2018was a man for whom family and its related responsibilities was important\u2019.[CITATION-76] This is an intriguing idea for how we think about Irish fatherhood in this period. The long eighteenth century is said to have coincided with the rise of the \u2018sentimental\u2019 father. As Joanne Bailey (Begiato)\u2019s work on English fatherhood has demonstrated, the ideal father in this period was loving and tender, providing \u2018hugs, material support and a protective guiding hand\u2019 to his children.[CITATION-77] Encapsulated in the concept of \u2018domestic patriarchy\u2019, a number of historians have shown how paternity was important to men\u2019s identities. As John Tosh and Karen Harvey have shown for middle-class Englishmen, male social reputations were inextricably bound up with the ability to fulfil the roles of \u2018dutiful husbands and attentive fathers\u2019.[CITATION-78] While there are few comparable historical studies that focus on Irish fatherhood for this period, a number of scholars have argued that the family was also central to the identity of men in Ireland.[CITATION-79] My own work on men\u2019s involvement in childbirth and early childcare revealed that similar tropes of \u2018sentimental\u2019 and \u2018tender\u2019 fatherhood were employed by middling-order men.[CITATION-80] Mary O\u2019Dowd has likewise noted that the family was important to Irishmen\u2019s identities, a fact that cut across the confessional divide.[CITATION-81] As a man on the rise, William Tennent had the means to meet the financial demands of paternity, while also adapting the rhetoric of sentimental fatherhood. In recognising his children, ensuring that they received a good education, and maintaining his role as the \u2018best of fathers\u2019, William fulfilled the expectations and obligations of legitimate parenthood. Katie Barclay\u2019s recent case-study of Gilbert Innes raises a similar point, noting how some men created families outside of the traditional household.[CITATION-82] William Tennent, however, took this further than Innes by outwardly acknowledging his responsibilities, giving his children the Tennent surname, and making economic provision for them, regardless of the opinions of those around him.[CITATION-83] In doing so, he straddled the space between models of elite and middling-rank fatherhood. William Tennent\u2019s example reveals how the expectations placed on legitimate fatherhood could be imbibed by unmarried men, who adopted these precepts and applied them to their own situations.What about the mothers? The ability of unmarried mothers to perform the duties of motherhood was contingent on the good will they received from fathers. As Kate Gibson has noted, illegitimate children in upper-middling families were usually removed from the care of their mothers at relatively young ages and placed in boarding schools.[CITATION-84] Regarded as \u2018unfit\u2019 on account of their unchastity, it was unusual for birth mothers to remain living with their children for long periods of time.[CITATION-85] The childcare arrangements made for the Tennent children appear to have followed a broadly similar pattern. Anne Henry\u2019s letters to William reveal that a number of them were placed in boarding schools. Both Jane and Octavia attended Gracehill, a boarding school in County Antrim, before progressing to another school for older girls managed by Mrs Sarah Fernside in London.[CITATION-86] That Anne\u2019s residence with her biological children was only temporary is also indicated by her anxiety and worry when she heard that William was engaged to be married. In her letters, Anne expressed her hopes that he would allow Isabella (her then youngest daughter) to continue to live with her until she was at least ten or eleven years old, and said she would prefer to keep her son Robert with her as long as possible.[CITATION-87] Her expectation was that Eleanor Jackson would replace her as mother and stepmother to the Tennent children.While Anne Henry may not have maintained physical proximity with her biological children throughout their childhoods, this did not preclude her ability to \u2018mother\u2019 the Tennent children. Through the medium of correspondence, Anne positioned herself at the centre of the Tennent family, adopting the roles of mother and \u2018stepmother\u2019 to the children. Importantly, this mothering did not involve the physical practicalities or spatial proximities of child-rearing, such as making clothes, preparing food, putting children to bed and organising daily routines. As Clodagh Tait and Kate Gibson have noted, \u2018worry work\u2019\u2014emotional work that generated \u2018practical action\u2019\u2014was an important aspect of mothering responsibilities.[CITATION-88] In her letters to William, Anne took pains to demonstrate how she fulfilled the emotional dimensions, the \u2018worry work\u2019, of mothering. Anne presented herself as being intimately knowledgeable about each of the children\u2019s individual tastes. Writing to William while he was on business in London in November 1804, she gave an account of the children\u2019s activities and recounted a list of what she thought they would like him to bring home as presents. Her comments give the impression that she knew each of the children on an individual level:Robert spends all his time at the Flute. I do not think its good for him because he is so often troubled with a pain in his Breast. I soppose he will be a good Dancer, he appears to be a good deal fonder of it than William. if Fiddels are not high priced I will be greatly obliged to you if you buy him one. Octavia & Isabella will be expecting a little Book or any other thing you please to buy them. if you buy the fiddel for Robert I hope you will remember your Old Son [i.e. William] I wish them all to be alike for all he has more in his power than any of them. I am sure he w[oul]think a great deal of any thing you w[oul]buy him.[CITATION-89] Evidently, Anne did not differentiate in her mothering between those children who were biologically hers and those who belonged to William\u2019s other mistresses. The same care and attention is to be found in letters that discussed her desire for (and then eventual dispatch of) a \u2018steel moneter\u2019 for Margaret\u2019s daughter Octavia, who was then at boarding school.[CITATION-90] Anne\u2019s correspondence gives the impression that the welfare of the Tennent children was important to her. In her letters, she frequently makes reference to the missives exchanged between herself and the children, and she expressed worry, disappointment and frustration when their replies were slow. For example, in a letter dated 18 November 1804, she told William that she was \u2018not well pleased with jane\u2019 because three weeks had passed since she received a letter, but that Octavia had written to her the previous Thursday and was \u2018very well\u2019.[CITATION-91] Indeed, Anne placed herself at the centre of the Tennent children\u2019s information network, relaying back to William the news that passed between them. In one letter, she expressed her relief that Jane had settled well in London, noting that she \u2018expect[ed] a long letter from her next week\u2019. Once this letter was received, Anne revealed that she planned to write to Octavia about its contents. This was then followed by an account of news from the boys: that William Junior had received a letter from George; that George had asked Anne to let his father know that he needed supplies for school; and that Henry had asked for apples as a present.[CITATION-92] Anne\u2019s maternal interest in the Tennent children extended to their health and emotional welfare. When a letter arrived for William from Octavia\u2019s boarding school, Anne opened it fearing that the child was \u2018unwell\u2019 and recounted to William how she would have been sorry to have neglected to answer any of the girl\u2019s letters.[CITATION-93] When she learned that William\u2019s daughter Nancy was to be sent by her mother to a school in Glasgow, and not attend the same one as her own daughter, Jane, she was upset. Writing to William in November 1804, she noted that she \u2018w[oul]d have been very glad that jane & [Nancy] w[oul]d have been at a school together. It w[oul]d have attached them to each other\u2019.[CITATION-94] Anne presented herself as the central maternal figure that held the children (and the family) together.It is open to debate whether Anne\u2019s concern for all of the Tennent children was genuine. We should keep in mind that her letters were designed to elicit a specific response in their recipients, and that she presented a carefully crafted version of herself in the correspondence.[CITATION-95] Yet we cannot discount the possibility that Anne was sincere in her affections, nor is it intrinsically unlikely that she took pleasure in her mothering role. Indeed, it is possible that Anne revelled in this role because it enabled her to reclaim a degree of respectability. Kate Gibson\u2019s study of mothering illegitimate children in eighteenth-century England suggested that married women chose to present themselves as \u2018good stepmothers\u2019 in order to \u2018demonstrate their feminine virtue and increase their social capital\u2019 as matriarchs.[CITATION-96] Such women took a keen interest in the upbringing of their illegitimate stepchildren, providing advice on schooling, welcoming them into their homes, and maintaining intimate relationships even after the deaths of their husbands.[CITATION-97] While birth mothers could salvage their reputations by presenting themselves as \u2018self-sacrificial\u2019 by living apart from their children, stepmothers were considered \u2018benevolent\u2019 in their adoption of illegitimate children.[CITATION-98] Anne Henry appears to have occupied the space between these two mothering tropes: she was a benevolent stepmother, who mothered the Tennent children through her fulfilment of emotional and practical care. Through the medium of her correspondence, Anne positioned herself as a \u2018good mother\u2019 and a \u2018good stepmother\u2019. In addition to managing the busy Tennent household and looking after the children who remained at home, Anne performed her other \u2018mothering\u2019 roles from a distance. She maintained a correspondence with the children who were away at school, she ensured that she occupied a central place in their information network, and she continued to fulfil the emotional labour that motherhood involved. In performing this model of \u2018good mothering\u2019, Anne renegotiated her marginal position, reclaiming a degree of authority and status in the process.As Anne Henry\u2019s letters indicate, her capacity to act as stepmother to the Tennent children was dependent on William remaining unmarried. When news reached Anne of his engagement to Eleanor Jackson, she wrote to William to express her anxiety that the marriage would alter their family dynamic, particularly with regard to the welfare of the children. Given that Anne had acted as mother to some of the children for a considerable period of time, it is entirely possible that her worries were genuine. Yet her comments were clearly chosen to elicit an emotional response. Isabella, she said, was \u2018crying to look at her\u2019, and she fretted that Jane would feel the change \u2018sevearley\u2019, prompting Anne to urge William to \u2018be cautous\u2019 in how he let his daughter know \u2018her fate\u2019.[CITATION-99] Anne also worried that William\u2019s marriage would change the relationships that underpinned the blended family they had created in Belfast. Writing in February 1805, she outlined her fears for the children: \u2018I declear to god its my fears for fear you should repent when its over & on your Children account because you pay so much attencion to them might cause you uneasyness when it wd be too leat\u2019.[CITATION-100] The surviving correspondence for the Tennent family suggests that Anne\u2019s fears were unfounded. How William actually broached the subject of his large family with his potential new wife is not known. But a draft of his thoughts on the matter, scribbled on the back of a letter received from his son William, provides some clues. What is clear is that maintaining relationships with all of his children was a priority. After outlining his intentions to marry and his financial fortune, William brought up the subject of his unconventional family:There are some circumstances attending my former life what some would perhaps think objectionable, but I am persuaded that your good sense & understanding will approve of what I intend to do in that respect. You have heard I know that I have several children, the Girls I intend after they have recd a proper education at their respective schools to bring home to my own house, & when they Marry to give them \u00a31000 fortune each\u2014the Boys to get a good education & introduce them into business.[CITATION-101] We do not know for sure that these lines actually made it into the final proposal made to Eleanor Jackson. However, that they were important enough for William to put them on paper is indicative of the value he placed on blending his family together.That Eleanor married William in spite of his large brood of illegitimate children has led some historians to describe her as \u2018open-minded\u2019 and \u2018tolerant\u2019.[CITATION-102] Frustratingly, we do not know how Eleanor felt about her husband\u2019s unconventional family set-up. She died in January 1807, less than a year after giving birth to their daughter, Letitia. Only four of Eleanor\u2019s letters to William survive in the family archive: one apparently written before their marriage and three in the years following.[CITATION-103] Her surviving letters portray a loving marriage, filled with expressions of longing when the pair were apart. When she spent time looking after her parents in County Monaghan, Eleanor wrote that though their separation was \u2018painful\u2019 it had \u2018convinced\u2019 her of \u2018the stren[g]th\u2019 of their attachment.[CITATION-104] There are hints, however, that Eleanor was anxious when they spent periods of time apart, and she was quick to censure William when he brought up the subject of other women.[CITATION-105] Recent research on stepfamily relationships has moved scholars to rethink the cultural stereotype of the \u2018wicked step-parent\u2019, particularly in the case of stepmothers. Bernard Capp, for example, has drawn attention to the multi-varied experiences of step-parents. While cold and abusive step-parents certainly existed, many maintained harmonious and loving relationships with the children of their new spouse.[CITATION-106] This appears to have been true of the relationships between Eleanor and the Tennent children. While her surviving letters do not mention the Tennent children explicitly, other letters in the family archive suggest not only that were they fond of Eleanor, but that she played an active role in their lives, even maintaining a correspondence with them when they were away at school. The children often asked after Eleanor in their letters to their father. Writing from boarding school in December 1806, Jane told her father that she had written to \u2018Mrs Tennent some time ago but have never had an answer. I hope illness is not the cause of her not writing to me. Be so good as to Remember me in the affectionate terms to her\u2019.[CITATION-107] The children also asked after her health. In January 1807, just days before Eleanor\u2019s death, Henry expressed his hopes that \u2018mrs Tennent [was] getting quite well\u2019 and asked his father to \u2018give his affectionate love to her\u2019.[CITATION-108] Indeed, Eleanor Jackson not only maintained a correspondence with her stepchildren, she also appears to have interceded with their father on their behalf. For example, when William quarrelled with his son Robert after he developed a problem with alcohol, the absence of Eleanor as peacemaker was noted by some in the family. Writing to William in September 1817, Anne Henry remarked that \u2018if Mrs T was Living he [woul]d not want a friend to speake to you in his favour & aske you to pardon him at this time\u2019.[CITATION-109] Eleanor Tennent\u2019s acceptance of her new husband\u2019s large brood of illegitimate children and his manner of raising them was not reflected in the attitudes of many around them in polite society in nineteenth-century Belfast. We get glimpses throughout the correspondence of the umbrage that many others took with the fact that William made no distinctions between his legitimate and illegitimate children. Eleanor Bond, a family friend of the Jacksons, was so aghast at the prospect that she wrote William a long letter, entreating him \u2018with the strongest & most powerful words\u2019 to \u2018alter \u2026 Immediately the situation\u2019.[CITATION-110] According to Bond, the Belfast rumour mill was hot with gossip that Letitia was not only living in the same household as several of William\u2019s other children, but that she was in the same city as their mothers. Eleanor Bond asked William if he thought that Letitia was \u2018fitted & strong enough to meet the slights, the sneers, the ill timed observation of the world\u2019.[CITATION-111] She encouraged him to send her away from Belfast and separate her from her illegitimate siblings:By the love you had for her mother By the love you have for her, by the decree of [in]creasing several heart rend[ing] thoughts about her, at the hour of your death, send her away to a Boarding School to a respectable a correct Female. but oh separate her & do not attempt what will not succeed. no not even here, to make the children of others & the children of a Wife in the same time the same class\u2014equally respectable \u2026 while you live, it may & will be done by your Particular Intimates, but remember you cannot live allways.[CITATION-112] Eleanor Bond\u2019s words had no apparent effect on William. It is clear from the surviving letters that he took great pains to ensure thatof his children were well provided for. The girls all attended the same boarding school, and received a broader education than most other middle-class daughters: they were instructed in Latin, science and the classics. William also ensured that the boys carved out respectable, middle-class careers and invested considerable amounts of money to make this happen. For example, William and Robert worked in banking, Franklin and George entered the East India Company, and Henry read law at Trinity College in Dublin. That William provided all of his children with the trappings of a middle-class upbringing is important because it demonstrates his commitment to ensuring their success, irrespective of their legitimacy status in law.[CITATION-113] Historians of siblinghood have noted that relationships in families comprised of half-siblings and step-siblings could become strained when it came to the division of material assets. Remarriage raised questions about inheritance and tensions within the family could be exacerbated by the death of a parent or step-parent.[CITATION-114] The case was even more complicated for illegitimate children in Ireland. Like those in Britain, they did not have a legal claim to family property and inheritance, unlike their legitimate siblings.[CITATION-115] Will-makers needed to make special provision for illegitimate children in order to secure their inheritances. William Tennent\u2019s will provides a fascinating insight into how these arrangements were made and the extent to which legitimacy (or other factors) shaped access to material resources.William made provisions for all of the children in his will. At the time he prepared and signed his will (29 September 1827), only seven of the Tennent children were still living.[CITATION-116] Letitia (his legitimate daughter), Jane, Isabella, Theresa, George, Ann (Nancy) and Octavia were all provided for in the will, but they were not provided for equally. William\u2019s wealth and property was divided up according to the legitimacy of his children, and by their birth order and marital status. His major possessions\u2014his estates in Counties Antrim, Fermanagh and Sligo\u2014were left to three of his surviving daughters, all of whom were unmarried at the time the will was signed. Letitia, his sole legitimate heir, was bequeathed the Tempo Estate, County Fermanagh; Jane, his eldest daughter, was left her father\u2019s estates in Sligo; and Isabella was granted the estates in Ballycastle, County Antrim, the Sugar House premises in Waring Street, Belfast, which brought in \u00a3116 11profit per annum in rent, and all the books relating to botany and natural history in her father\u2019s library.[CITATION-117] George, as William\u2019s sole remaining male (though illegitimate) heir, was left the Edenreagh estates, County Tyrone, out of which \u00a3100 per annum was to be paid to his sister Ann (Nancy).[CITATION-118] That these decisions were taken with legitimacy in mind (and not gender) is indicated by the fact that Letitia was bequeathed the most lucrative of her father\u2019s assets. Whereas the Edenreagh estate left to George was purchased for \u00a310,000 in 1817, the sizeable Tempo Estate, a property of more than 2,000 acres, was bought by William in 1813 for the principal sum of \u00a329,000.[CITATION-119] Moreover, William took steps to secure the legitimate transmission of the Tempo Estate. In the event that Letitia died without issue, William directed that his nephew, Robert James Tennent, was to inherit the estate. If Robert James died without any heirs, the estate was then to pass to Jane, and the same terms dictated its passage to Isabella. George, his sole surviving son, was not nominated in the succession. Importantly, William did not make similar provisions for his nephew to inherit his other estates, instead nominating the other children as default heirs.[CITATION-120] Aside from the succession of the Tempo Estate, the legitimacy of the Tennent children does not appear to have mattered much in the making of the will. Instead, William Tennent\u2019s remaining material assets were carved up according to the individual circumstances of the children. Those who were already married received lesser portions than their unmarried siblings. Theresa, who in April 1824 married the merchant Roswell King, was bequeathed the lease and rents arising on a property in Waring Street, as well as the interest on a bond of \u00a31,000 settled on her husband; Ann (Nancy) who was married to Richard Dillon, another merchant, was left the interest on a bond of \u00a31,000 held between her father-in-law and husband, as well as \u00a3100 per annum from George\u2019s Edenreagh estate; Octavia, who married Samuel Dawson, a shipping agent and merchant, was left the leases of premises in James Street and Patrick Street, Belfast, as well as the interest on a sum of \u00a31,000 loaned to her husband.[CITATION-121] William also made provisions in his will for the perpetuation of the family name. Inserted in the provisions made for Letitia, Jane and Isabella was the following clause: they would inherit provided \u2018from and after her Marriage in case she and Her then, and any future Husband she may have, shall take and use the surname of Tennent only and not otherwise\u2019.[CITATION-122] In the tradition of elite families with property at stake, this stipulation was designed to preserve the link between the family name and material assets. If the future sons-in-law did not agree to adopt the family name, they would forfeit their right (and that of the Tennent daughters) to benefit from the inheritance. This move can be set within the tradition of dynasty-building. Requiring that non-blood relatives change their name and adopt another was not uncommon. Indeed, over the course of the eighteenth century, a growing number of individuals in England petitioned to change their names by royal licence from the College of Arms to qualify for inheritance.[CITATION-123] A number of scholars have suggested that the vogue for changing the family name was representative of wider developments in attitudes towards the meaning of the family. Drawing on literary texts, Sophie Coulombeau has noted that the hereditary name became an \u2018arbiter of identity\u2019 for the elite.[CITATION-124] Tim Stretton has argued that the growing acceptance of half-siblings as named beneficiaries in wills demonstrates that that for many in this period, the \u2018family meant the family name rather than close blood ties\u2019.[CITATION-125] Given William\u2019s \u2018unconventional\u2019 approach to family life and the fact that four of his sons predeceased him, it is entirely possible that similar motives were at work here. Ensuring the perpetuation of the Tennent family name through conjugal, rather than consanguineal, ties may have been a deliberate tactic.Another explanation is also possible. The Tennent stipulation may have been crafted with the intention of enhancing the attractiveness of William\u2019s unmarried daughters on the marriage market. The adoption of a surname in exchange for a sizeable material inheritance may have been enough to ensure good marriage partners for his unmarried daughters, particularly in the case of Letitia. If this was so, the measure may indicate that William was aware that his unconventional mode of living could disadvantage the chances of marriage for his legitimate daughter.[CITATION-126] Such a move was not unprecedented. When George Tennent wrote to his father in 1815 about the prospect of a match with a woman named Miss Montgomery, a wealthy heiress from County Galway, he made a point of asking his father not to mention his family background. According to George, while Miss Montgomery was \u2018thoroughly \u2026 acquainted with every particular of [his] family & birth\u2019 and had \u2018wave[d] every family prejudice\u2019, she had counselled him \u2018to say nothing at all about it\u2019 to her father.[CITATION-127] Likewise, when William\u2019s nephew, Robert James, engaged himself to Eliza McCracken, the daughter of a wealthy Belfast businessman, the McCrackens received an anonymous letter, scolding them for uniting their daughter with \u2018Will Tennant\u2019s band of Bastards\u2019.[CITATION-128] While historians of the family have noted how factors such as age, birth order and gender shaped relationships between siblings, the role that legitimacy played in defining siblinghood is much less studied. The Tennent family archive offers an interesting insight into this aspect of family relationships. While no letters between the children are extant, we can partly access their thoughts and feelings in their surviving letters to other members of the family. All of the Tennent children maintained correspondence with their father, and it is through these letters that we can recreate elements of their siblinghood.[CITATION-129] At first glance, the letters suggest that they maintained close and affectionate relationships, and that they were largely untroubled by their legal status. In letters to their father, they each remembered to ask after their siblings, and expressed disappointment, frustration and annoyance when they did not receive regular letters. Writing from Spain in September 1808, Franklin complained that he was not kept up to date with news from home: \u2018My surprize ceases at Henry\u2019s not writing to me as I understand that all the letters I wrote to him are at Belfast \u2026 he was to be in Belfast very shortly after Jane wrote\u2019.[CITATION-130] George complained to his father in September 1818 that he had not received any letters from his sisters, remarking that he was \u2018quite astonish\u2019d at Isabellas silence\u2019.[CITATION-131] Octavia likewise wrote to her father in December 1830 that she was sure Jane was annoyed with her \u2018she being the only one who has neglected me\u2019.[CITATION-132] These grumbles were also shared by Letitia, William\u2019s legitimate daughter. In a letter to her father in May 1822, she complained that she had not heard from her sister Isabella in a very long time and asked her father to \u2018tell her I expect daily an account of the transactions\u2019 that have occurred at home, particularly news of her sister Theresa, whom she was \u2018very anxious to learn something of\u2019.[CITATION-133] The Tennent siblings not only wrote to one another, they also took a keen interest in each other\u2019s lives. Henry appears to have relished the role of older brother, and concerned himself with the education of his younger sisters. In letters to his father, he often enquired about their progress and made recommendations about what subjects he thought they should be studying. In November 1809, for example, he wrote to Tennent outlining his worries that his sisters were not keeping to their books:My Sister Octavia has neglected her education very much. I think it wd be perfectly proper to send her to some school, where by a steady attention, she might recover what she has lost \u2026 However if you allow me to go home for a fortnight at Christmas \u2026 we may converse about her and Isabella who, I think, if she can be kept from Idlness, will make a very good scholar. I hope Jane is keeping them both at their French. \u2026 I wish them both well exercised in reading, and the four first rules of arithmetic.[CITATION-134] The half-siblings also interceded on one another\u2019s behalf when they displeased their father, and entreated him to restore their brothers and sisters to favour. For example, when William Tennent Junior fell foul of his father\u2019s displeasure in 1808 after racking up considerable debts, the Tennent siblings rallied round to make peace. Henry wrote a number of letters to his father on the subject, and begged him to forgive his brother\u2019s foolishness:Oh! My Dear Father, the situation of my poor Unfortunate Brother Wm frequently recurs to my Remembrance \u2026 A Father\u2019s love forfeited. His former hopes blasted, & Himself perhaps a Debtor. How painful were my feelings at the moment I read in yr last letter, yourexpressions concerning him \u2026 Oh! receive him once again. \u2026 How angry are I at myself; whilst in the country I made butfor my unfortunate Brother. Alas! \u2026 Oh! My Father, do receive him back again.[CITATION-135] To Henry\u2019s delight, the pair eventually reconciled. In a letter to William, Henry recounted that his brother Robert had given him \u2018the most sincere pleasure\u2019 he had \u2018ever experienced\u2019 by informing him that William and his father had since reconciled.[CITATION-136] He added his hopes that \u2018no unhappy difference [would] again ever interrupt that Harmony which should subsist between relatives to closely united\u2019.[CITATION-137] It is important to keep in mind that these well-wishes, frustrations, and disappointments were conveyed in lettersWilliam Tennent. As Amy Harris has noted, sibling rivalries were often played out in letters: who wrote to whom, what information was conveyed, and how often, underpinned the micro-aggressions, power-plays and disputes that existed beneath the surface.[CITATION-138] Moreover, as the work of Shannon Devlin on Irish siblinghood has revealed, while letters offered siblings the opportunity to keep in touch and maintain bonds, unanswered and slow responses to letters acted as focal points for anxiety, unhappiness and distress.[CITATION-139] Read in this way, the Tennent children\u2019s comments to their father may have been a performative tactic to demonstrate their qualities as \u2018good\u2019 brothers and sisters. Complaining in letters to him about the failure of brothers and sisters to keep in contact enabled the writer to position themselves as the dutiful and loving sibling and, by extension, more deserving of their father\u2019s esteem, attention and love. While some of the siblings\u2019 sentiments may have been genuine, it is likely that the Tennent children used their letters to vie for their father\u2019s attention.Relationships between the Tennent siblings were not, however, as cordial as they first appear. Indeed, it is clear that tensions over their legitimacy came to the fore as the children got older. This was particularly the case between Letitia (the legitimate daughter) and Isabella. While letters between the two feuding sisters do not survive, a number of letters exchanged between James Emerson Tennent (Letitia\u2019s husband) and Robert James Tennent (William\u2019s nephew) provide an insight into the bad blood that had existed between the two women since childhood. According to Emerson Tennent, Letitia had grown up in an atmosphere of \u2018tyranny & persecution\u2019 and he identified Isabella as the main culprit.[CITATION-140] Emerson Tennent alleged that Isabella had violent tendencies, confiding that she had more than once grabbed Letitia and Theresa by the throat.[CITATION-141] Earlier letters between Letitia and her father also hint that the two girls had a difficult relationship, and on one occasion Letitia was forced to defend herself against a charge that she \u2018hated\u2019 her sister.[CITATION-142] Following William\u2019s death in July 1832, animosities between the two sisters reached boiling point. Central to their dispute was the will. While all of the surviving Tennent children had been provided for in the 1827 will, three settlements made by William after that date had an impact on the inheritances of Letitia, Isabella and Jane. The 1827 will had bequeathed William\u2019s largest property, the Tempo Estate, to Letitia. Following her marriage to James Emerson in 1831, William made provision for Letitia to have access to an independent annuity of \u00a3200. He did this by transferring three parcels of land on the Tempo Estate to his friend James Thompson, who was to hold the land in trust for the purposes of raising the annuity. When Isabella married James Thompson in 1832, a further settlement was enacted that drew on the Tempo Estate. On 12 June 1832 (weeks before his death), William conveyed in trust another parcel of the Tempo Estate to Robert Thompson\u2014the townland of Kilculla, together with the Sugar House tenement\u2014 to raise money so that Isabella also had access to an annuity of \u00a3200. Jane\u2019s involvement in the subsequent legal battle can be explained by a settlement made by William in November 1830 regarding his ownership of the Sligo estates. At the time of writing the will, William held joint ownership of the Sligo estates (which he bequeathed to Jane) with Samuel Thompson. On 17 November 1830, he conveyed ownership of the estate to a trustee in order to sever the joint tenancy\u2014a move that later caused problems for Jane\u2019s inheritance.[CITATION-143] After William\u2019s death, the family became embroiled in a long legal dispute that made its way to the Irish Court of Chancery\u2014the main recourse for solving property disputes in the period.[CITATION-144] In February 1833, Isabella and her husband, James Thompson, filed a cause with the Chancery Court to have the trusts of the will put into execution. This prompted the case to be referred to a Chancery Master, who pronounced in May 1834 that it would be for Letitia\u2019s benefit to \u2018take against the will\u2019. As an \u2018heiress at law\u2019, Letitia was legally entitled to a greater share of her father\u2019s property than that which was allocated to her by the will. Indeed, this was confirmed the following year when Chancery decreed that the three settlement revisions made by William revoked the terms of the 1827 will. This meant that Letitia was legally entitled to the Sligo estate (originally bequeathed to Jane) and to the entire Tempo Estate (one parcel of which had been placed in trust for Isabella\u2019s benefit). A legal oversight had left the question of ownership of the Sugar House tenement open, and Letitia petitioned Chancery in 1843 to have her entitlement confirmed. Isabella, Jane and James Thompson sued the rest of the family through the Chancery Court for access to compensation for the trusts they had lost, naming not only Letitia and her husband, but also their sisters Theresa and Ann (Nancy) and their husbands, their cousin Robert James Tennent and his son, and Francis McCracken (who acted as guardian of Robert James\u2019s son).[CITATION-145] Why Letitia decided against honouring her father\u2019s wishes cannot be known. Financial gain probably played an important part. After all, as heiress-at-law, Letitia was entitled to the Tennent fortune. Yet it is also likely that the tense relationships between the sisters factored into the decision. Family members attributed the sibling rivalry between the girls to William\u2019s decision to raise the children together, on an equal footing. Writing to Emerson Tennant in January 1838, Robert James conceded that while it was \u2018painful to speak of the errors of those who are gone\u2019, it was true that his uncle was to blame:I will therefore briefly admit, that Letitia was all her life placed in a false position, & subjected to a rash & unfortunate experiment. Of the conduct of those who still live \u2026 I feel that they also were placed in a false position with regard to the world & its opinions \u2026 I am satisfied that Letitia was made the victim of jealousy, falsehood, & sordid intrigue, by some of those whom you say she 'wished to consider as her relatives.' I am convinced that as my uncle advanced in years, her home was systematically made miserable, & the sympathies of her true friends designedly turned away, & even the fountain of her fathers affection attempted to be poisoned by the same interested parties.[CITATION-146] While Robert\u2019s remarks reveal that he felt pity for Letitia, his sympathies also extended to Isabella and the other Tennent children. Having been brought up in the same household as their legitimate sibling, and encouraged to regard themselves as equals, one can imagine the distress, hurt and anger that some of the Tennent children must have felt in the aftermath of their father\u2019s death. The dispute over the will caused a major fissure in the family and the siblings remained estranged for many years.[CITATION-147] It was not until the later 1840s that relationships between Letitia and some of her siblings were mended. A number of letters from Octavia to Robert James in the 1840s note that Letitia had been back in contact, and that Octavia was pleased to hear that her sister was doing so well.[CITATION-148] Historians of siblinghood have noted how inheritance disputes among siblings afford an insight into how gender, birth order and marital status shaped the health of households.[CITATION-149] As the case of the Tennent children shows, concepts of legitimacy also played an important role. The law favoured legitimate children. In cases where the will of a parent was contested, or a parent died intestate, legitimate siblings held more legal power than their illegitimate counterparts. Children born outside of marriage were at a disadvantage and depended on the continuing goodwill of their half-siblings.What, in the end, can the Tennents tell us about the family and its relationships in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Ireland? Drawing broad conclusions from one case-study is problematic. The Tennent family was certainly unconventional by nineteenth-century standards, yet that makes it no less or more easy for modern audiences to understand. It is precisely this complexity that makes the Tennents such a powerful example. They illustrate the messy realities of family life in Ireland: the competing allegiances, loyalties and agendas that governed family relationships; the complicated mix of love, jealousy and rivalry that shaped interactions; and how these relationships changed over time, as members aged and power dynamics shifted. If we want to understand family life in Ireland we need to explore \u2018the family\u2019 in its entirety. This includes not only the vertical hierarchies that structured the family, but also horizontal and diagonal relationships between siblings, cousins, uncles and aunts. Relationships within the family were not static; they responded to changes in family composition brought about by births, marriages and deaths, and they were shaped by gender, birth order, favouritism and legitimacy. The Tennents demonstrate the insights that can be gained by looking outside of traditional frameworks for studying the family and their example pushes Irish historians to think more broadly about how families were made and functioned.The Tennent family also presents Irish historians with the opportunity to rethink illegitimacy as a category. While the family certainly rubbed against the conventions and values of polite society in nineteenth-century Belfast, their example demonstrates how experiences of, and attitudes towards, illegitimacy were inflected by social rank. Growing up, the Tennent children were largely shielded from the shame and stigma that was associated with illegitimate birth. As was the case with elite Irish men, William\u2019s wealth and his social and political influence acted as a bulwark against contemporary scorn, enabling him to adjust middling order concepts of fatherhood. William tried to ensure that all of his children reaped the benefits of his middling-order status, pushing them towards education, lucrative careers, and good marriages. It was only over time, and with the death of the patriarch Tennent, that the disparities between the Tennent children bubbled to the surface. As adults, the Tennent siblings struggled to reconcile their legitimacy status, resulting in a family rift that does not appear to have ever fully healed.The Tennents also contribute to emerging research on parenting illegitimate children in Britain and Ireland. As a father who made arrangements for the practical and emotional care ofhis children, William Tennent straddled the space between legitimate and illegitimate, elite and middling-order paternity. Broader ideas of paternal responsibility were adopted by men such as Tennent, who vindicated their extra-marital sexual activities by fulfilling the same obligations that were expected of men who fathered children in marriage. Likewise, Anne Henry\u2019s adaptation of the stepmother role enabled her to perform some aspects of motherhood usually given only to married mothers. Acting as the maternal figure at the centre of the Tennent network, Anne reclaimed a degree of respectability through her management of an alternative domestic space. Through her letters and in her stewardship of the Tennent household, Anne carried out the \u2018worry work\u2019 of motherhood. The experience of Margaret McCabe likewise brings into sharper focus how experiences of illegitimacy were inflected by other factors. Her ability to mother her children was contingent not only on her position as the mother of illegitimate children, but on her relationship with William Tennent. The Tennent family deepens our understanding not only of the Irish family, but of the often surprising role that illegitimacy played in shaping its dynamics."

    "text": "The memoirs of the parliamentarian lawyer and MP Bulstrode Whitelocke are invaluable as a primary source for historians wishing to understand the political history of the 1640s and 1650s. Yet, despite broad recognition of the contentious nature of this material, surprisingly little has been done to establish the accuracy of Whitelocke\u2019s account or to probe the motives behind the writing of his post-Restoration reflections. By focusing on Whitelocke\u2019s recollections of two famous encounters with Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and 1652, this article demonstrates that there is much in the detail of those accounts that fails to convince in the light of what is known of events and the author\u2019s activities from evidence beyond his memoirs. Rather, it seems that the accounts of these meetings were fabricated in order to obfuscate Whitelocke\u2019s activities during the Interregnum period and to propagate a series of narratives that served the author\u2019s purposes as he sought political rehabilitation after the Restoration of 1660. By failing to recognise the memory games at play in Whitelocke\u2019s work, historians have unwittingly embedded many of those same narratives in their accounts of the period, not least concerning the durability of the regime established in 1649 and Cromwell\u2019s kingly ambitions.The memoirs of the lawyer and MP Bulstrode Whitelocke (1605\u201375) are as treacherous as they are essential.[CITATION-1] Written after the Restoration, and published posthumously in late 1681 as, Whitelocke\u2019s reflections provide crucial information concerning the Interregnum that is unmentioned in any other source.[CITATION-2] In the evidentially \u2018dark and vacant\u2019 period between the battle of Worcester and the dissolution of the Rump Parliament, Whitelocke offers illumination, not least in his account of two meetings that purportedly took place with Oliver Cromwell in December 1651 and November 1652.[CITATION-3] In recounting those meetings, Whitelocke offers a rare glimpse into Cromwell\u2019s motivations and machinations.Historians have long recognised that Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs must be handled with care. For Thomas Carlyle, Whitelocke\u2019s conversations with Cromwell were of \u2018dubious authenticity\u2019; his memoirs \u2018smack a little of the date when he redacted them\u2019.[CITATION-4] Nevertheless, for want of other evidence, Carlyle and most historians since have relied upon Whitelocke\u2019s account. For all the caveats about memoirs being self-serving and present-centred, Whitelocke\u2019s testimony is taken to be, more or less, truthful.[CITATION-5] His evidence remains integral to scholarly accounts of the 1650s, underpinning historical narratives about the Commonwealth regime and its ultimate failure.This article demonstrates a pressing need to reassess Whitelocke\u2019s evidence and the conclusions built upon it. While Whitelocke did not always remove seemingly damaging material from his accounts, he did shape it to disseminate certain narratives about the various Interregnum regimes and his role within them. Far from shying away from his status as a Cromwellian confidant, he played upon it, using his knowledge of private affairs to obfuscate publicly known details about his activities. Focusing upon Whitelocke\u2019s accounts of his meetings with Cromwell in 1651 and 1652, this article shows how aspects of both accounts fail to match their historical context. Rather, they were perfectly calibrated to suit Whitelocke\u2019s purposes after 1660, obscuring his part in the events of the Interregnum and asserting his enduring loyalty to Stuart monarchy.Besides reassessing Whitelocke\u2019s account, however, this study also illuminates the broader problem of memory sources for civil war scholarship. While important recent research explores how memories of the wars were constructed and contested by examining previously untapped sources, including petitions, ceremony and visual culture, much can still be learned from more familiar repositories of memory, including memoirs.[CITATION-6] Memoirs allow focused study of the dynamic relationship between individual and collective memory\u2014the ways in which private memories were fitted to, or shaped around, \u2018public\u2019 memories prescribed by the state after 1660.[CITATION-7] Yet the relationship was not unidirectional. Whitelocke did not simply frame his memoirs around an accepted public account; he also crafted his own narratives about the events of the 1640s and 50s which, in turn, influenced subsequent civil war histories. This examination of Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs exemplifies the difficult and complex interplay during the early modern period between personal experience, memory and history. Historians must realise that civil war memory is not simply an object of historical study; it is also embedded in civil war histories, underpinning many of the narratives that scholars continue to write about the period.Had Whitelocke never written his memoirs, his role in the events of the 1640s and 1650s would still be recognised today. When awaiting Charles II\u2019s return in early 1660, Whitelocke undoubtedly wished his profile had not been so prominent. One can imagine his reaction in March 1660 when a satirical pamphlet, entitled, cast a spotlight on his political career with particular emphasis on his enmity towards the Stuarts.[CITATION-8] Ventriloquising Whitelocke, the anonymous author claimed that the disrespectful treatment he received while negotiating with Charles I at Oxford in 1643 first \u2018implanted in me such an inveterate, implacable malice to him and his posterity\u2019.[CITATION-9] In 1651, he \u2018was sent to make speeches against the young King\u2019, the future Charles II, \u2018at\u2019, which he did with \u2018much vigour and confidence\u2019.[CITATION-10] Whitelocke\u2019s \u2018Masterpiece\u2019 was his \u2018Embassy unto\u2019, where his aim was \u2018to baffle and depose Princes\u2019, advancing Queen Christina\u2019s abdication in the hope that her successor would be more amenable to invading Poland, thereby drawing off Spanish forces that might otherwise aid the Stuart cause.[CITATION-11] Many wanted revenge on Whitelocke at the Restoration. He noted how he \u2018was threatned by some ag[ains]t whom he had acted ... that they would procure him to be excepted out of the Act of oblivion and generall pardon\u2019.[CITATION-12] The Convention Parliament contained numerous adversaries, chief among whom was the architect of the Restoration, George Monck. Whitelocke heard how Monck worked to have him \u2018excepted in the Act of Oblivion, if not for life\u2019 then \u2018to be disabled for any office &c\u2019.[CITATION-13] Monck\u2019s hostility apparently derived from an incident in November 1659, when, having heard of Monck\u2019s intention to march into England, Whitelocke, then a member of the Committee of Safety, went to the Common Council of London to inform them of \u2018the proceedings of Moncke; & that the bottom of his design was to bring in the King\u2019.[CITATION-14] Monck was incensed by Whitelocke\u2019s actions, which \u2018putt a dishonour uppon him\u2019 and \u2018might [have] spoyled all the buisnes\u2019 of the king\u2019s return.[CITATION-15] For his part, Whitelocke saw no reason why Monck should bear a grudge; of the two of them, \u2018Moncke had the better & the effect of what he designed\u2019.[CITATION-16] Whitelocke did everything he could to avoid the malice of his enemies. He called on friends and family to work on his behalf, even securing an audience with the king in early June 1660.[CITATION-17] The whole effort cost Whitelocke a \u2018great deale of money in gratifications, & buying out of ennemies\u2019.[CITATION-18] Even with such painstaking management, however, Whitelocke could not conceal his past actions. Enemies such as William Prynne, who mined the parliamentary record for evidence against Whitelocke, had plenty to draw upon.[CITATION-19] Pre-empting their accusations, Whitelocke \u2018drew up a large paper of the State of his own case, in all the changes & revolutions\u2019 which he \u2018transcribed & delivered to his friends in both houses as he apprehended fitt & seasonable\u2019.[CITATION-20] This \u2018Case of Bulstrode Whitelocke Kt\u2019 demonstrates the dexterity with which Whitelocke deflected the charges that he anticipated his enemies would level against him. It also provided the basic narrative framework around which he constructed his lengthier memoirs in the years that followed.Whitelocke\u2019s essential defence in 1660 was his avoidance of the key political events of the 1640s and 1650s. He \u2018had no hand in secluding the members of the House of Commons, nor in any force uppon publicke assemblies att any [time] butt declared his judgem[en]t ag[ains]t it & refused to act in it, & detested it\u2019.[CITATION-21] Of course, he passed silently over his willingness to servethose regimes responsible for forcing parliaments. He also disavowed any role in Charles I\u2019s trial. He could hardly deny that he had been named to the committee appointed on 23 December 1648 to \u2018consider how to proceed in a way of Justice against the King\u2019: it was in the Commons\u2019 Journal.[CITATION-22] But Whitelocke insisted that he refused to attend the committee; he left town and \u2018returned not, till that buisnes was over\u2019.[CITATION-23] Whitelocke also denied involvement in the various constitutional upheavals of the Interregnum. He had \u2018no hand in any changes of governem[en]t, the greatest whereof were made when he was beyond Sea\u2019.[CITATION-24] This defence is intriguing when one considers that Whitelocke was only \u2018beyond Sea\u2019, serving as extraordinary ambassador to Sweden, from November 1653 to the summer of 1654. This meant he was absent during the establishment of the Protectorate; but he was very much at the centre of affairs for other significant upheavals, including the abolition of the kingly office and the House of Lords in early 1649, and the forced dissolutions of the Rump in 1653 and 1659. To diminish his own culpability, Whitelocke stressed that the Cromwellian seizure of power in late 1653, rather than the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1649, was the revolutionary pivot of the period.Equally devious was Whitelocke\u2019s assertion that Cromwell never really trusted him. \u2018Cromwell bare him no favour, but left him out of the Little Parlem[en]t, & out of his Councell, before & after he was Prot[ecto]r\u2019.[CITATION-25] According to Whitelocke, Cromwell even coerced him into going to Sweden \u2018to ridde him out of the way\u2019.[CITATION-26] He played down the fact that he retained Cromwell\u2019s favour during the Protectorate, though he could not altogether conceal it. Even after he \u2018layd downe\u2019 his place as lord commissioner of the Great Seal in 1655 in opposition to Chancery reforms, he accepted a lucrative treasury post.[CITATION-27] Whitelocke was apparently still in favour in June 1657 when, at Cromwell\u2019s second inauguration ceremony, he rode in the protectoral coach and even helped to vest the Protector with his robes of state. Further advancement followed later that year when Whitelocke was summoned by Cromwell to sit as a lord in the newly created \u2018Other House\u2019.[CITATION-28] Whitelocke also sought to underline his enduring loyalty to the Stuart cause. He countered accusations that his Swedish embassy was prejudicial to the royalists. He stressed that his mission \u2018did not derogate from the K[ing]\u2019; Queen Christina herself remarked how he \u2018spake of his Prince w[i]th respect, & of his adversaries like a gentleman\u2019.[CITATION-29] Mischievously, Whitelocke also called on Cromwell as a witness to his pro-Stuart credentials. Cromwell did not trust Whitelocke, and kept him out of favour, precisely because he \u2018him to incline to the Kings restauration, & to have correspondence for that end, as their Intelligences also informed the Councell\u2019.[CITATION-30] The phrasing here is a masterpiece of studied ambiguity. Whitelocke did not claim that he advocated Charles II\u2019s restoration, only that Cromwellthat he did. The Council received \u2018Intelligences\u2019 claiming that Whitelocke had correspondence \u2018for that end\u2019\u2014but were these reports?[CITATION-31] In the light of what he later wrote in his memoirs, it is intriguing that Whitelocke did not claim in his \u2018Case\u2019 that he told Cromwell directly of his preference for restoring Charles II.Ultimately, Whitelocke\u2019s efforts paid off. On 14 June 1660, after reading the \u2018humble Petition of Bulstrode Whitlock\u2019, the motion to except him from the Act of General Pardon, Indemnity and Oblivion was defeated by 175 votes to 134, or \u2018carryed by 50 voices\u2019, in Whitelocke\u2019s exaggerated account.[CITATION-32] It was in this tense atmosphere, as Whitelocke struggled to defend life, property and career, that he devised a number of narratives about the 1640s and 50s which were subsequently fleshed out in his memoirs. Whitelocke worked on those memoirs around the mid-1660s, producing two manuscripts that, after heavy editing, were published posthumously as the.[CITATION-33] The first and more detailed of the manuscripts, known as the \u2018Annales\u2019, begins in the year of Whitelocke\u2019s birth, 1605, and ends in 1656; the second, described erroneously by its modern editor as Whitelocke\u2019s \u2018Diary\u2019, begins in the same year but continues up to his death in 1675.[CITATION-34] The relationship between the manuscripts is ambiguous. The \u2018Annales\u2019 is described as a \u2018public history\u2019\u2014telling the story of English affairs, but written in the first person. The \u2018Diary\u2019, though covering many of the same events, lacks the detail of the \u2018Annales\u2019 and describes Whitelocke\u2019s activities in the third person. The anonymous editor of the printedseems to have consulted both manuscripts\u2014up until 1656, the bulk of the text derives from the \u2018Annales\u2019, albeit rendering the text in the third person; after 1656, the editor appears to have continued the narrative by using the \u2018Diary\u2019.[CITATION-35] This means that theare a hotchpotch that reproduces neither of Whitelocke\u2019s original texts faithfully. An updated edition of the, printed in 1732 and reissued in 1853, converts the text back to the first person, and adds previously unprinted material from the \u2018Annales\u2019, but much remains omitted or imperfect. For this reason, we must turn to the manuscripts to explore more closely the narrative that Whitelocke, as opposed to his editors, wanted to tell.It is unclear why Whitelocke wrote his memoirs, or why he composed two separate accounts.[CITATION-36] In the \u2018Annales\u2019, he insists that they were merely \u2018to instruct his children\u2019 and were not \u2018for publique view\u2019. Yet he also warned his children that they would probably \u2018heare your father censured\u2019 for the work.[CITATION-37] Indeed, it is possible that, like the \u2018Case of Bulstrode Whitelocke\u2019 in 1660, his memoirs circulated in manuscript. The vigour with which Whitelocke battled against being barred permanently from office in 1660 suggests that he hoped for political rehabilitation. Yet, even with the full benefit of the Act of General Pardon, Whitelocke struggled to decontaminate his past. The fact that he found so much time to write these accounts, along with a couple of toadying treatises for Charles II in defence of monarchical power, attests to his ongoing efforts to escape the political wilderness.[CITATION-38] Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs are an exercise in legerdemain; they draw attention to certain events while distracting the reader from others. They must be scrutinised closely to comprehend why exactly Whitelocke chose to divulge certain information and, where possible, to look for what was hidden or omitted. Besides exploring how each episode fits within the story that Whitelocke wanted to tell, we must examine whether his account stands up to what we know outside of his text; where events have no proof beyond Whitelocke we must be especially wary.One such event is the meeting that Whitelocke records under the date of 10 December 1651 as \u2018Uppon the defeat att Worcester\u2019.[CITATION-39] According to Whitelocke, Cromwell \u2018desired a meeting with divers Members of Parliament, and some chief Officers of the Army, at the Speakers House\u2019. There, Cromwell:proposed to them, that now the old king being dead, & his son being defeated, he held it necessary, to come to a settlem[en]t of the Nation. And in order therunto he had requested this meeting, that we togither might consider & advise what was fitt to be done, & to be presented to the Parlem[en]t.Whitelocke opened the discussion by asking \u2018in the first place\u2019 what sort of government was desired: \u2018whether of an absolute Republique, or with any mixture of Monarchy\u2019. Cromwell agreed this was \u2018the right point, & indeed it is my meaning, that we should consider, whether a republique, or a mixt Monarchicall governem[en]t will be best to be setled, & if any thing Monarchicall, then in whome that power shall be placed\u2019.[CITATION-40] Whitelocke claims that the army officers present \u2018were ag[ains]t any thing of Monarchy\u2019; the lawyers, on the other hand, \u2018were generally for a mixt Monarchicall governem[en]t, & many were for the D[uke] of Gloucester\u2019, Charles I\u2019s youngest son, \u2018to be made king\u2019. Whitelocke himself proposed that there \u2018may be a day given for the kings eldest son, or for the D[uke] of Yorke his brother to come in to the Parlem[en]t, & uppon such termes as shall be thought fitt, & agreeable both to our Civill and spirituall liberties, a settlem[en]t may be made with him\u2019. Cromwell, responding to the lawyers\u2019 suggestions, opined that it would \u2018be a buisnes of more than ordinary difficulty\u2019, but \u2018if it may be done with safety, & preservation of our rights both as English men, & as Christians, that a settlem[en]t with somewhat of Monarchicall power in it, would be very effectuall\u2019.[CITATION-41] For historians, this meeting demarcates a crucial phase in the history of the Commonwealth regime.[CITATION-42] The post-Worcester turning point is a central motif of Blair Worden\u2019s seminal study of the Rump Parliament. Besides galvanising radical aspirations in the army for social, legal and religious reform, it was an occasion for constitutional reflection. The abolition of monarchy was deeply unpopular even among those complicit in the events of 1649; kingless government was a stop-gap and never meant to be a permanent fixture.[CITATION-43] Those wanting to restore monarchy had to be patient, however. \u2018Before Worcester\u2019, Worden explains, \u2018the royalist threat made it unthinkable that the Rump should voluntarily restore monarchy\u2019.[CITATION-44] It was \u2018only when the royalist threat had been eliminated\u2019 that it became \u2018practical to advance proposals for some form of monarchical settlement\u2019, and \u2018Cromwell was among the first to air them\u2019.[CITATION-45] In the short term, however, nothing came of those discussions, \u2018and the issue of monarchy was quietly dropped\u2019.[CITATION-46] But was \u2018the issue of monarchy\u2019 ever an issue at all? Beyond Whitelocke\u2019s account, and a few hostile pamphlets making the perennial accusation that Cromwell sought to be king, there is little to suggest that Cromwell\u2019s preference was for kingly government or that MPs were working towards such a settlement.[CITATION-47] The reliance on Whitelocke\u2019s unique testimony becomes especially concerning when one considers several anomalies in the content of his account. Most curious is the assumption underlying the conference: that its participants had a free choice between a republican and a monarchical settlement. While historians habitually point to this meeting to demonstrate the appetite for constitutional change post-Worcester, a closer look at Whitelocke\u2019s account suggests that the discussion concerned not so much aof government as theof one.All the speakers seemed oblivious to the realities of the political settlement as it stood in 1651: it was as if the events of 1649 had never happened. For instance, when John Desborough asked, \u2018why may not this as well as other Nations, be governed in the way of a Republique?\u2019, he ignored that this was precisely the way the nation had been governed since 1649.[CITATION-48] He did not ask why the nation should notto be governed in such a way. Conversely, the lawyers argued that a settlement without monarchy would be unworkable. Oliver St John believed that it \u2018be found, that the governem[en]t of this Nation, without something of Monarchicall power,be very difficult to be so setled, as not to shake the foundation of our lawes, & the liberties of the people\u2019; Whitelocke was adamant that the \u2018lawes of England are so interwoven, with the power & practise of Monarchy, that to settle a governem[en]t without somthing of Monarchy in it,make so great an alteration in the proceedings of our lawe,, nor can we wellthe inconveniencies which will arise therby\u2019.[CITATION-49] Both St John and Whitelocke warned of problems thatarisethe government were settled in a non-monarchical fashion. They ignored completely the fact that the government had already been settled \u2018without somthing of Monarchy\u2019 for almost three years; one wonders why itsshould make \u2018so great an alteration\u2019 that they had \u2018scarce time to rectify\u2019 its faults or to anticipate its inconveniences. They ignored the changes effected in early 1649 to facilitate the exercise of the laws under the new kingless regime, not least the alteration of writs and styles used in the law courts, which Whitelocke helped to draft.[CITATION-50] Moreover, all of those lawyers present had acted in their judicial capacities since the establishment of the Commonwealth. Yet none of the opponents of monarchy raised this fundamental flaw in the lawyers\u2019 argument: that by serving the post-1649 kingless regime they were witnesses against themselves.Equally strange is that nobody at the meeting mentioned the 1649 Act abolishing the kingly office, which stated bluntly that \u2018no one person whatsoever shall or may have, or hold the office, style, dignity, power or authority of King\u2019.[CITATION-51] While it could be contended that the \u2018mixed monarchical\u2019 solution proposed at the meeting circumvented the Act by proposing that kingly power be shared, and not reside in one person alone, the fact remains that all the suggested candidates were prohibited by that law. Those who endeavoured \u2018the reviving or setting up again of any pretended right\u2019 of Charles, James or \u2018any other the issue and posterity of the said late King ... to the said regal office, style, dignity, or authority\u2019 were to be proceeded against as traitors.[CITATION-52] It therefore seems odd that Sir Thomas Widdrington blithely supposed that \u2018we shall hold it most just to place that power in one of the sons of the late king\u2019.[CITATION-53] Whitelocke even proposed that a day be appointed for Charles or James \u2018to come in to the Parlem[en]t\u2019 so that \u2018a settlem[en]t may be made with him\u2019.[CITATION-54] Edward Whalley objected by pointing out that \u2018[t]he kings eldest son hath bin in armes ag[ains]t us, & his 2[nd] son likewise is our ennemy\u2019, but failed to note the Act barring them from the throne. Widdrington recommended \u2018the late kings third son, the D[uke] of Gloucester\u2019, who was \u2018still amongst us, & too young to have bin in armes ag[ains]t us, or infected with the principles of our ennemies\u2019.[CITATION-55] Yet this still amounted to setting upthe issue and posterity\u2019 of Charles I and was no less treasonous under the purview of the Act.Intriguingly, when referring to the meeting, few historians give credence to the names that Whitelocke claims were touted as potential kings. For instance, Austin Woolrych and J.C. Davis both ignore Whitelocke\u2019s suggestion about inviting Charles or James to take the Crown, noting only the plan to crown Gloucester.[CITATION-56] Ian Gentles does not mention the Stuart candidates at all, suggesting that once Cromwell expressed a preference for settlement with \u2018somewhat of monarchical power\u2019 in it, \u2018the thought would have occurred to everyone in the room that since no Stuart was permitted to exercise monarchical power, who else but Oliver could fill the role?\u2019 Yet Whitelocke\u2019s account hardly bears this out. Those lawyers who backed the Stuart children seem to have been oblivious to what Gentles suggests should have been obvious: that \u2018no Stuart was permitted to exercise monarchical power\u2019.[CITATION-57] Leaving aside the 1649 Act, the proposals for a Stuart restoration also seem odd, given the timing of the meeting. When introducing his account, Whitelocke makes plain that the conference took place \u2018Uppon theatt Worcester\u2019\u2014a strange choice of words for what was, emphatically, a parliamentarian victory.[CITATION-58] From the outset, Whitelocke emphasises that this battle was a decisive blow to the royalist cause. This is backed up by Cromwell\u2019s opening address: \u2018that now the old king being dead, & his son being defeated, he held it necessary to come to a settlem[en]t of the Nation\u2019.[CITATION-59] It suggests that Cromwell could only contemplate settlement once the Stuarts were totally defeated and their hopes of recovery extinguished. In short, when introducing this meeting, Whitelocke signposts repeatedly that onlythe king was dead, andhis son was completely defeated, were minds able to turn to constitutional settlement.With this context established, the words uttered by Whitelocke at the 1651 meeting assume a greater magnanimity than if they had been expressed in an earlier or later setting. His willingness to offer Charles the opportunity to return when his cause was at its lowest ebb amplified Whitelocke\u2019s good intentions. He made no secret that there should be conditions: any settlement with Charles should be \u2018uppon such termes as shall be thought fitt\u2019 to secure \u2018our Civill & spirituall liberties\u2019.[CITATION-60] Of course, this was exactly what occurred in 1660. Yet Whitelocke\u2019s suggestion, in the context of late 1651, is far more generous given that, at that point, the incumbent government was secure\u2014poles apart from the pandemonium of 1659 that narrowed political options drastically. Monck brought about a restoration in 1660 because there was no viable alternative; Whitelocke claimed to have advocated that strategy in 1651 when the possibilities for future settlement seemed open.But this is all an illusion. If we look at Whitelocke\u2019s actions outside the framing of his own account, his attitude towards the Stuarts appears far less benign around the time of Worcester. On 25 August 1651, the Commons\u2019 Journal records that Whitelocke reported \u2018from the Council of State, a Proclamation, declaring Charles Stewart, and his Abbettors, Agents, and Complices, to be Rebels and Traitors to the Commonwealth of England\u2019.[CITATION-61] That he neglects to mention this in his memoirs is understandable. The proclamation did not mince its words: Charles was already \u2018a Traytor of a former Date\u2019 and had since rendered himself \u2018more and more obnoxious to the Penalties of the Laws of England, Declaring and Adjudging High Treason\u2019.[CITATION-62] When the proclamation was published the following day, the Rump also ordered that a letter sent by Charles to the Lord Mayor and aldermen of London, forwarded to Parliament by Whitelocke on the Council\u2019s behalf, should be \u2018burnt ... by the Hand of the common Hangman\u2019.[CITATION-63] Whitelocke\u2019s role in blackening Charles\u2019s reputation lived on in royalist memories. The hostilerecalled the time when Whitelocke was \u2018sent to make speeches against the young King atwhen he was at\u2019, which he did \u2018with so much vigour and confidence\u2019 that Robert Tichborne, alderman and sheriff of London, \u2018durst throw the Kings Declaration into the fire made at the Exchange\u2019.[CITATION-64] It surely served Whitelocke\u2019s purposes to distract from this episode by claiming that, shortly after, he recommended Charles\u2019s rehabilitation. Yet it seems unlikely. Even after their emphatic victory at Worcester, the majority in Parliament sought to bring Charles to justice, not to negotiate with him. One week after the battle, Parliament issued a further proclamation calling for the \u2018Discovery and Apprehending of, and other Traytors his Adherents and Abettors\u2019. In no uncertain terms, it demanded the \u2018speedy Apprehending of such a Malicious and Dangerous Traytor to the Peace of this Commonwealth\u2019; he was \u2018to be proceeded with ... as Justice shall require\u2019.[CITATION-65] Even if Whitelocke was prepared to ignore Charles\u2019s crimes, it is unlikely that the army officers at the meeting in December would have forgotten them. Yet, as with the deafening silence concerning the 1649 Act, according to Whitelocke nobody mentioned that Charles had been declared a traitor by Parliament.Equally suspicious is the lack of a British context in Whitelocke\u2019s account. Arguably, the settlement of Scotland, not England, was Parliament\u2019s priority immediately after Worcester. Plans for union were announced in a declaration by the Council that was presented by Whitelocke for the Rump\u2019s approval on 23 October.[CITATION-66] According to that declaration, Scotland was to be:incorporated into, and become One Commonwealth with this of England; whereby thethat is established here, and enjoyed by the good People of this Nation, under theof England, asmay be derived and communicated unto them, with such convenient speed, as the same can be made practicable amongst them.[CITATION-67] There was no suggestion that Scotland, or England, would return to monarchy: the declaration castigated \u2018Charls Stuart, pretended King of the Scots\u2019 and his abettors.[CITATION-68] That Whitelocke said nothing in his memoirs about his involvement in this declaration is hardly surprising. By setting out its blueprint for Scotland, Parliament reaffirmed its confidence in the constitutional arrangement already settled in England. This was not a regime riddled by self-doubt or pausing to reflect upon the basis and form of its government: rather, that form of government was to be exported to Scotland in order to extirpate the dregs of Stuart monarchy.[CITATION-69] Besides presenting the draft declaration to the Rump, Whitelocke also reported the Council\u2019s recommendations for eight commissioners to be sent into Scotland, including Oliver St John.[CITATION-70] The commissioners\u2019 instructions were debated by the Rump on 4 December.[CITATION-71] On 10 December, the day when Whitelocke suggests the meeting at the Speaker\u2019s house took place, he reported amendments to those instructions.[CITATION-72] If there really was a meeting that day, surely Scotland would have been at the forefront of the minds of those present\u2014particularly St John, who was preparing for his journey north. And yet, according to Whitelocke\u2019s account, nobody mentioned Scotland at all. While discussing the future of the English government, nobody thought it worthy of note that the Rump had already decided to extend kingless government into Scotland. According to Whitelocke, discussion focused on the settlement of \u2018the Nation\u2019; nothing was said about the nations.Much of Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 meeting seems odd upon closer inspection. The content of the meeting sits uneasily with the context in which it purportedly took place and contains startling silences, not least concerning the 1649 Act, the proclamations against Charles II and the issue of settling Scotland. Such are the incongruities in the account that one might ask whether the meeting occurred at all.Yet the 1651 meeting was not the only occasion in Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs when he was embroiled in discussions concerning the nation\u2019s future settlement. Three years earlier, in December 1648, Whitelocke had similar conversations with many of those who were present in 1651. On 18 December 1648, Whitelocke notes how he and Widdrington went to the office of the Master of the Rolls and Speaker of the Commons, William Lenthall, to meet with Cromwell. The assembled had \u2018a long discourse togither about the present affayres\u2019, concluding with Cromwell appointing \u2018another time ... for us to meet againe ... to consider & conferre how the settlem[en]t of the kingdome might be best effected\u2019.[CITATION-73] The next meeting took place on 21 December at the Speaker\u2019s house, where discussion again turned to \u2018the settlem[en]t of the kingdom\u2019. In conclusion, Widdrington and Whitelocke were enjoined to \u2018drawe up tomorrowe, some heads uppon the discourse\u2019.[CITATION-74] The paper they produced included \u2018heads for a Declaration, what the Parlem[en]t intendeth for the settlem[en]t of the kingdome, to be considered off, & offered to the Parlem[en]t & Council of the Army\u2019.[CITATION-75] This all seems very familiar. In his account of the 1651 meeting, Whitelocke claims that Cromwell \u2018held it necessary, to come to a settlem[en]t of the Nation\u2019 and hoped those present \u2018might consider & advise what was fitt to be done, & to be presented to the Parlem[en]t\u2019.[CITATION-76] The feeling ofis more pronounced when one reads Whitelocke\u2019s account of a subsequent meeting on the afternoon of 23 December 1648. Once again, he and Widdrington went by \u2018appointm[en]t\u2019 to the \u2018speakers house\u2019 and met \u2018divers gentlemen of the house, & we consulted about setling the kingdome by the Parlem[en]t, & not to leave all to the sword\u2019. Although theare not divulged, Whitelocke hints that discussion centred upon the issue of what to dothe king\u2019s trial. Should the army be left to shift for itself or should a parliamentary settlement be put in place? Both Whitelocke and Widdrington \u2018spake our minds freely\u2019\u2014although he never reveals what they said. Instead, Whitelocke provides a synopsis of the meeting, the details of which are familiar enough:some of them were wholly ag[ains]t having any king att all, others were ag[ains]t having the present king or his eldest or second son, to be king, others were for the 3[rd] son the D[uke] of Gloucester, who was among them, & might be educated as they should appoint, to be made king.[CITATION-77] Interestingly, it seems nobody spoke for the current king. The key issue was whether to have no \u2018king att all\u2019 or to retain monarchy with one of Charles I\u2019s offspring.Although held three years apart, the meetings of 1648 and 1651 took place at the same location, involved many of the same people, and offered the same solutions. But were they really separate meetings? Perhaps Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 conference simply transposes details from 1648 to three years later. The inconsistencies in the content of the 1651 meeting disappear when applied to the context of late 1648. With preparations for the king\u2019s trial underway, it was perfectly natural to consider the question of settlement. It made sense for Whitelocke to ask whether \u2018an absolute Republique\u2019 or government with \u2018any mixture of Monarchy\u2019 was the best way forward, because that decision had yet to be made. In this context, St John\u2019s warning that it \u2018will be found, that the governem[en]t of this Nation, without something of Monarchicall power, will be very difficult to be settled\u2019, or Whitelocke\u2019s complaints that kingless government would make such changes in legal proceedings \u2018that you have scarce time to rectify, nor can we well foresee the inconveniencies\u2019, seem apposite.[CITATION-78] In late 1648, the lawyers stared into the abyss, pondering the consequences of the king\u2019s destruction. With the purged Parliament and army officers pushing forward the king\u2019s trial and execution there was a pressing need to find a settlement sooner rather than later.Whitelocke\u2019s proposal that a day might be \u2018given for the kings eldest son, or for the D[uke] of Yorke his brother to come in to the Parlem[en]t\u2019 also seems more appropriate in the context of late 1648.[CITATION-79] At that point Charles and James had not so blotted their copybooks as to preclude the possibility of them ascending to their father\u2019s throne. The army\u2019sof November 1648 proposed \u2018that a timely and peremptory day may be set for the Prince ofand the Duke ofto come in and render themselves\u2019.[CITATION-80] Of course, even if the Stuart brothers complied, thedid not guarantee rehabilitation. It recommended that Charles \u2018be proceeded against in justice, or remitted, according as upon his appearance he shall give satisfaction or not\u2019. Likewise, James must \u2018give satisfaction or not concerning his carriage in and since his going out of the kingdome (being without leave) and in opposition or Contempt of the Parliament\u2019 before he could \u2018be considered as to future trust, or not\u2019.[CITATION-81] Yet thedemonstrates that in late 1648, even in army circles, the possibility of Charles or James becoming king remained open. The same could not be said in 1651: besides the Act of 1649, the Rump\u2019s emphatic declarations of treason against Charles and his abettors for their complicity in levying a third Civil War meant that, if they were to fall into Parliament\u2019s hands, judicial proceedings were assured and not merely a possibility.The plan to make Henry Stuart, duke of Gloucester, king also better fits the context of late 1648. On 23 December 1648, it was urged that Gloucester, \u2018who was among them, & might be educated as they should appoint \u2026 be made king\u2019.[CITATION-82] Similarly, at the 1651 meeting Widdrington touted Gloucester, who was \u2018still amongst us & too young to have bin in armes ag[ains]t us, or infected with the principles of our ennemies\u2019.[CITATION-83] Yet, while Gloucester was very much \u2018among them\u2019 in late 1648, residing in London in the care of the earl of Northumberland, this was not the case by late 1651. In mid-1650, following Charles\u2019s arrival in Scotland, the Council of State deemed it unsafe to keep the younger Stuart children nearby. In response, the Rump resolved that Henry \u2018be removed forthwith beyond the Seas,\u2019.[CITATION-84] Ultimately, the Council sent Henry and his sister Elizabeth to the Isle of Wight, under the guardianship of Anthony Mildmay.[CITATION-85] It may also be significant that Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 meeting is far more detailed than those of late 1648. While this could reflect his fading memory of events, it may have been a deliberate ploy. In the context of the Restoration, it would be understandable if Whitelocke played down his role in discussions about constitutional settlement without Charles I that took placethe king\u2019s trial and execution. Whitelocke was careful enough to note that the 23 December meeting occurred only after Charles\u2019s position seemed hopeless. He describes in the \u2018Annales\u2019 how, earlier that day, there had been \u2018a sharpe debate\u2019 in the Commons which \u2018sett on foote\u2019 the \u2018great designe of taking away the King\u2019: the \u2018fierce party\u2019, backed by the army, \u2018prosecuted their designe with all eagerness\u2019, meaning that \u2018no opposition would be to any effect or purpose\u2019.[CITATION-86] This provides the necessary context for the meeting at the Speaker\u2019s house that afternoon; that is, it was onlythe fate of the king was certain that discussion of a settlement without Charles began in earnest, with many MPs attempting to preserve Stuart monarchy. But this was an inglorious defence: it made the best of a bad job, effectively conceding Charles I\u2019s ruin. The sensitivity of the discussions at that meeting may explain why, when writing up his \u2018Diary\u2019, Whitelocke omitted it altogether.[CITATION-87] It served Whitelocke\u2019s cause to shift details from the 1648 meetings to the context of 1651. In this later setting, speeches in favour of the Stuart children became a plea for restoration, rather than a tacit condoning of the removal of Charles I. It gave the impression that Whitelocke and many MPsto harbour hopes in 1651 of seeing one of Charles\u2019s sons placed on the throne. Above all, the 1651 meeting distracts from Whitelocke\u2019s prominent role in bringing the regime of 1649 into being. Besides entrusting Whitelocke to prepare an order for altering the style of writs so that legal proceedings ran in the name of Parliament rather than the king, the Rump also committed the drafting of the Act for abolishing the House of Lords to his \u2018especial care\u2019.[CITATION-88] Moreover, Whitelocke helped to pen the Rump\u2019sof 17 March 1649, which defended \u2018Setling the present Government In the way of A Free State\u2019.[CITATION-89] This was, quite literally, a defining document for the fledgling regime; it defended the regicide as well as the abolition of the kingly office. Whitelocke\u2019s prominent role in drafting the Declaration stuck in the memories of his enemies: hostile commentators writing across the following decade remembered \u2018Declaration\u2019 or \u2018Patriot... his Declaration for a Free State\u2019.[CITATION-90] Whitelocke could hardly deny his authorship of the. He admitted in his memoirs that on 16 March he presented Parliament with \u2018a draught of the Declaration which he was commanded to drawe\u2019.[CITATION-91] Yet he alleged that the draft he presented was very different to the published version. After his draft was read in Parliament, it was \u2018moved to passe it presently without any committm[en]t\u2019 but Whitelocke \u2018moved it might be committed to amend some faults in it\u2019. This proved to be counter-productive, because \u2018uppon the Commitem[en]t they made it much sharper than I had drawne it, & added divers clauses, which I thought matters fitt to have been omitted\u2019.[CITATION-92] This was an ingenious defence. Unable to deny his role in drafting the, Whitelocke claimed to have penned a milder version, only for it to be amended, expanded and made \u2018much sharper\u2019. But aspects of Whitelocke\u2019s account are suspect. One wonders why the radical majority in Parliament initially accepted Whitelocke\u2019s draft \u2018without any committm[en]t\u2019; it was apparently only after Whitelocke himself requested a committal that sweeping changes were made. Moreover, the fact that the Journal records that Whitelocke reported those revisions on 17 March casts doubt on the extent to which he disapproved of them.[CITATION-93] Whitelocke fails to elaborate on the \u2018faults\u2019 in his original draft and those matters in the revised version that he thought better \u2018omitted\u2019. His defence is another example of his clever use of silence and concision to allow the best possible reading of his actions. Despite conceding authorship of thehe leaves it to the reader\u2019s imagination to guess what portions were his and which were \u2018sharper\u2019 than he intended.After the Restoration, there were clearly some passages in thefrom which Whitelocke was more eager to distance himself than others. Particularly troubling would have been the opening section justifying both the king\u2019s execution and the exclusion of the House of Stuart. It stressed that Charles\u2019s crimes tainted his children, making them incapable of rule. It was clear that \u2018from these Branches could be expected no other, then the same bitter Fruit which fell in the Reign of the Father, who had engaged Them in his own ways and quarrel\u2019. Because the \u2018two Eldest\u2019 sons had appeared \u2018in actual Arms\u2019 against Parliament, it was clear that \u2018No more Safety or Security could be hoped for from Them, then from their Predecessor\u2019. Moreover, thedenied that \u2018the younger Children\u2019, including the duke of Gloucester, \u2018were born to any thing\u2019. To avoid a \u2018Succession of Misery\u2019 it was decided to take \u2018away the Succession of that, from whence it hath always risen, and would certainly spring again, if permitted to take new Root\u2019.[CITATION-94] There was nothing to suggest any glimmer of hope for a Stuart restoration: it was a firm defence of that clause in the Act abolishing the kingly office which made it treason to set up \u2018any pretended Right of ... the Issue and Posterity of the ... late King\u2019.[CITATION-95] For a man who claimed \u2018no hand\u2019 in the greatest upheavals of the Interregnum, Whitelocke clearly helped to facilitate the change of government in 1649, including the altered form of legal writs, the Act abolishing the House of Lords and the printed defence of the new regime. When writing his memoirs, Whitelocke never denied his role in establishing the Commonwealth regime: his profile had been too prominent for such a tactic to work. Instead, he minimised his complicity and diminished the threat that regime posed to the Stuart cause. His account of the 1651 meeting is integral to this process. It suggests that, whatever his involvement, the constitutional changes of 1649 were a stop-gap, not a bar to monarchy or the Stuart cause. It gives the impression that the discussions of late 1648 did not end when Whitelocke and others backed the kingless Commonwealth in 1649. Rather, they continued to long for a monarchical government, and a Stuart revival, well into the 1650s.These narrative strategies, when coupled with the many inconsistences between content and context, all strengthen the case for Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 meeting being either a complete invention or based upon words uttered in late 1648. Of course, the latter option raises further issues that would need explanation. Most obviously, while most of the speakers mentioned were in London in both late 1648 and 1651, a few were not. Charles Fleetwood does not appear to have been active in army affairs in late 1648 and John Desborough was not in London, being appointed governor of Yarmouth. Equally, some key players in the discussions in late 1648 are missing from the conversation in 1651. For instance, Richard Deane, one of the officers at meetings in late 1648, was away from London in 1651 serving as a major general in the army then occupying Scotland.[CITATION-96] Cromwell\u2019s son-in-law Henry Ireton was also a key figure in late 1648, but in 1651 he was commanding Parliament\u2019s forces in Ireland, where he died on 26 November.[CITATION-97] All this does not eliminate the possibility that Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 meeting borrows details of conversations from three years earlier, however. Perhaps earlier speeches from 1648 were assigned to speakers known to have been around in late 1651. This could explain a curious mistake whereby Fleetwood and Desborough are both assigned the rank of \u2018Colonel\u2019. By late 1651 these men were Lieutenant General and Major General respectively, and in earlier and subsequent passages of the \u2018Annales\u2019 Whitelocke gives both their correct titles.[CITATION-98] Perhaps the slip reveals that their names were added as an afterthought. With officers such as Deane or Ireton no longer around in late 1651, Whitelocke may have assigned their roles in the discussions of 1648 to figures who became prominent players in the regimes of the 1650s.More broadly, whether Whitelocke invented or recycled his account of the 1651 meeting, it might also be asked how he expected to get away with it. If, contrary to his professions about seeking only to instruct his children, his manuscripts were circulated more widely, we might think that Whitelocke risked his deception being exposed by the meetings\u2019 participants. Yet this was unlikely: of the eight men whom Whitelocke records speaking besides himself, four were dead and three were in exile by the time he worked on his \u2018Annales\u2019.[CITATION-99] Charles Fleetwood was the only participant still living in England, but he remained tainted by his prominent role in the events of 1659; he was barred from holding office under the Act of General Pardon in 1660 and lived out his days in obscurity.[CITATION-100] Crucially, none of those lawyers who allegedly joined Whitelocke in recommending Stuart monarchy in 1651 were around to verify, or contradict, his story.So far this article has suggested that Whitelocke\u2019s account of the post-Worcester conference in 1651 is a fabrication, possibly grounded upon discussions that occurred three years earlier. Such an invention served Whitelocke\u2019s purposes in two ways: it indicated that the regime established in 1649 was never intended to last and implied that those involved in that regime, Whitelocke included, did not envisage or want the extirpation of Stuart monarchy. The fact that Whitelocke helped to establish the kingless regime and promoted anti-Stuart polemic is obscured by a narrative that suggests enduring loyalty to both monarchy and the Stuart cause. Yet Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 meeting also brought out another key theme that runs throughout his memoirs, namely the story of Cromwell\u2019s scheming for the Crown. This trope served two important purposes: besides showing that Whitelocke was Cromwell\u2019s dupe, it demonstrated that even Cromwell believed monarchy was preferable to kingless forms of government.Beyond Whitelocke\u2019s account, however, there is little to suggest that Cromwell favoured a government with \u2018somewhat of Monarchicall power in it\u2019. As with other aspects of the 1651 meeting, these words seem more suited to the context of late 1648. Then, in line with the army\u2019s, Cromwell was probably amenable to the option of a settlement with a semblance of monarchical power in it, most likely with Gloucester as a puppet king.[CITATION-101] Yet, once the decision was taken to abolish kingship, nothing outside of Whitelocke\u2019s testimony suggests that Cromwell professed a desire for the return of monarchical rule.[CITATION-102] With Charles II defeated, it does not appear that Cromwell suddenly had an appetite for constitutional change. Writing immediately after the battle of Worcester to Speaker Lenthall, Cromwell claimed that it had pleased God \u2018to establish the nation and the change of government, by making the people so willing to the defence thereof\u2019. Far from being an opportunity for constitutional change, Cromwell saw the decisive crushing of the Stuart cause as a providential affirmation of the kingless regime. What was now needed, according to Cromwell, was\u2014 social, legal and religious\u2014not aof government.[CITATION-103] According to Whitelocke\u2019s testimony, however, Cromwell not only contemplated replacing the kingless regime after Worcester, but also pondered setting himself up as monarch. The best-known, and most often cited, evidence of Cromwell\u2019s machinations is Whitelocke\u2019s record of a private conversation that he claimed to have had with Cromwell in St James\u2019s Park in November 1652.[CITATION-104] Like the 1651 meeting, however, many aspects of this account are problematic. Most obviously, there are technical grounds for questioning Whitelocke\u2019s report. Even if the conversation happened, it is unlikely that he made an accurate record of it. The version in the \u2018Annales\u2019 is set in the form of a detailed dialogue between the two men, giving an impression of immediacy and completeness. Yet unless Whitelocke took notes as he strolled with Cromwell in the park, his account would have been subject to memory fade, exacerbated by however much time elapsed before he committed it to paper. As Worden notes, Whitelocke\u2019s use of dialogue as a literary device casts doubt upon the accuracy of his record. It is for this reason that Worden sees the record of this conversation in the \u2018Diary\u2019, which is not in dialogue form and is much more concise, as the \u2018more lifelike\u2019 or \u2018fresher\u2019 of the two accounts.[CITATION-105] Leaving aside the practicalities of recording early modern utterances, however, there is much about the content of the conversation, as with the 1651 meeting, that does not match the context in which it supposedly took place or what we know of the subsequent actions of Whitelocke and Cromwell. The dialogue recorded in the \u2018Annales\u2019 opens with Cromwell complaining about the Rump\u2019s inaction on the issue of reform. This aspect of the conversation is believable enough, given Cromwell\u2019s writings and actions elsewhere. In words that echo his letters after Dunbar and Worcester, Cromwell claimed the need to \u2018improve the mercies & successes which God hath given us, & not to be fooled out of them againe\u2019; the Rump had to \u2018make good what we have so dearly bought, with so much hazard, bloud, & treasure\u2019.[CITATION-106] Cromwell levelled complaints against the Rump that chime with the army\u2019s stated grievances at the time. He criticised their \u2018designe to perpetuate themselves\u2019 and the \u2018scandalous lives of some of the chiefe of them\u2019; all \u2018these things\u2019 gave \u2018too much ground for people to open their mouths against them & to dislike them\u2019.[CITATION-107] As with the 1651 meeting, however, the conversation of November 1652 suggests that Cromwell was not only fed up with the Rump but also with the idea of sovereign unicameral parliaments. That is, his distaste for the Rump prompted him to question the constitutional arrangement settled in 1649. Specifically, Cromwell lamented the lack of restraints upon the Rump: they were \u2018lyable to no account to any nor to be controwled or regulated by any other power, there being none superiour, or coordinate with them\u2019. He predicted that \u2018unlesse there be some authority & power so full & high as to restraine & keep things in better order, & that may be a checke to these exorbitancies, it will be impossible in humane reason, to prevent our ruine\u2019.[CITATION-108] Beginning to catch Cromwell\u2019s drift, Whitelocke counselled obedience to Parliament: \u2018we our selves have acknowledged them the supreame power, & taken our Com[missio]ns & authority in the highest concernements from them, & how to restraine or curbe them after this, it will be hard to finde out a way for it\u2019. Yet Cromwell had a solution in mind. Suddenly, he asked Whitelocke to consider: \u2018What if a man should take uppon him to be king?\u2019[CITATION-109] Before examining Whitelocke\u2019s response to this searching question, it is worth pausing to consider how details in this conversation jar against what we know of events in the months that followed. Most obviously, the dissolution of the Rump was not the prelude to an alteration in the form of government or a power grab by Cromwell. The printed declaration issued by Cromwell and the Council of Officers two days after the dissolution stressed their commitment to government by sovereign unicameral parliaments. Prior to the dissolution, the officers and \u2018some of the Parliament\u2019, including Whitelocke, discussed an expedient whereby \u2018Supream Authority should be by the Parliament devolved upon known Persons, men fearing God, and of approved integrity\u2019. This was not a long-term solution; the assembly was entrusted with the \u2018Government of the Common-wealth... for a time\u2019 to carry out the reforms sought by the army. It would give the people time to \u2018forget Monarchy\u2019 and appreciate \u2018their true Interest in the Election of Successive Parliaments\u2019, thereby allowing the government to be \u2018settled upon a true Basis\u2019.[CITATION-110] Cromwell and the army were frustrated with the Rump Parliament, not with the rule of Parliament itself. They still hoped to secure that settlement first articulated in the 1649 Act abolishing the kingly office: government by successive, representative, parliaments without peril to the \u2018safety of the people that hath betrusted them\u2019.[CITATION-111] The Nominated Assembly was not considered a change of government; rather, it was meant to expedite pressing social, religious and legal reforms ahead of the return to government by elected parliaments in the not-too-distant future.[CITATION-112] Cromwell\u2019s call for checks and balances on the Rump in the conversation of November 1652 is more suited to the context of twelve months later, following the bitter experience of the failure of the Nominated Assembly and the foundation of the Protectorate. True, when defending theto the first Protectorate Parliament in September 1654, Cromwell argued that \u2018Government by a Single Person and a Parliament is a fundamental. It is the, it is constitutive\u2019.[CITATION-113] Yet, beyond Whitelocke\u2019s testimony, there is nothing to suggest that Cromwell saw things this way before the dissolution of the Rump. In late 1652 and early 1653 Cromwell and the army fixated upon the membership of Parliament, that is, ensuring that the right men were chosen, rather than restraining Parliament\u2019s legislative powers. They feared that elections under the Rump\u2019s bill for a new representative would return men of the same stamp as those time-servers who had frustrated the army\u2019s demands. The Nominated Assembly was a crude attempt to remedy this problem by creating a parliament in the army\u2019s image. As Cromwell later lamented in a speech to MPs in April 1657, the Nominated Assembly was \u2018a story of my own weakness and folly\u2019. It \u2018was done in my simplicity\u2019, at a time when Cromwell still naively believed that a packed assembly would get the work of reform done.[CITATION-114] The failure of that assembly demonstrated to Cromwell that controlling parliamentary membership was insufficient and that constitutional checks were needed to make government with elected parliaments work in the interests of the army. The result was thewhich not only set qualifications for parliamentary elections but also balanced legislative authority between the Protector and unicameral parliaments.[CITATION-115] If the details of the 1652 conversation fail to match the context, even more suspect is Whitelocke\u2019s response to Cromwell\u2019s searching question about kingship. Whitelocke told Cromwell that his proposed \u2018remedy\u2019 of taking the kingship \u2018would be worse then the disease\u2019. The title would \u2018be of no advantage\u2019 to Cromwell \u2018because you have the full kingly power in you already\u2019. As Lord General he controlled the \u2018Militia\u2019; in the \u2018nomination of civill officers\u2019 those he thought \u2018fittest are seldome refused\u2019; and even though he had \u2018no Negative vote in the passing of lawes, yett what you dislike will not easily be carryed\u2019. Overall, Whitelocke saw \u2018lesse envy & daunger, & pompe, butt not lesse power & reall opportunities of doing good, in your being Generall then would be if you had assumed the title of king\u2019.[CITATION-116] After Whitelocke\u2019s cold response, Cromwell probed further, claiming that he had heard \u2018some of your profession observe, that he who is actually king (whether by election or by discent) yett being once king, all acts done by him as king, are lawfull & justifyable\u2019. This was embodied in the 1495Act of Henry VII, which made it \u2018safer for those who act under a king (be his title what it will) then for those who act under any other power\u2019. Ultimately, Cromwell believed that the \u2018power of a king is so great & high & so universally understood\u2019 that it might \u2018indempnify in a great measure, those that act under it\u2019.[CITATION-117] Whitelocke was unmoved by these legalistic arguments; he put no trust in \u2018that Act of Parlement [of] ... H. 7. which will be little regarded or observed to us by our ennemies, if they should come to gett the upper hand of us\u2019.[CITATION-118] He warned Cromwell that if he became king then \u2018the question will be no more, whether our governem[en]t shall be by a Monarke, or by a free state, butt whether Cromwell or Stuart shall be our king & Monarke\u2019.[CITATION-119] On the face of it, this exchange might suggest that Whitelocke did little to modify his earlier opinions in his post-Restoration memoirs. After all, it hardly seems prudent for Whitelocke to admit that he claimed monarchy was of little value and that Cromwell was better off ruling without it. Yet it transpires that Whitelocke had not really given up on monarchy; rather, he dissuaded Cromwell, only to promote the idea of a Stuart restoration instead. With trepidation, he told Cromwell of \u2018private thoughts\u2019 that were \u2018not fitt or safe for me to communicate\u2019. When pressed by Cromwell to speak his mind, Whitelocke asked him to \u2018consider the condition of the King of Scots\u2019. Given his utter defeat at Worcester, Whitelocke believed that Charles \u2018& all about him cannot butt be very inclinable to hearken to any termes, wherby their lost hopes, may be revived\u2019. Cromwell should seek a \u2018private Treaty\u2019 with Charles by which \u2018you may secure your selfe, and your friends & their fortunes, you may make your selfe & your posterity as great & permanent to all humane probability, as ever any subject was\u2019. This treaty could remedy the constitutional ills that led to civil war, imposing \u2018such limits to Monarchicall Power as will secure our spirituall & civill liberties\u2019.[CITATION-120] In giving this advice, Whitelocke claimed to speak \u2018out of my affection & service to your Exc[ellenc]y & to all honest men\u2019.[CITATION-121] Cromwell, however, broke off the conversation abruptly, seemingly \u2018displeased with what I had sayd\u2019. Thereafter, Cromwell\u2019s \u2018carryage\u2019 towards Whitelocke was \u2018altered, & his advising with me, not so frequent nor intimate as before\u2019. Soon after, Cromwell sent Whitelocke away to Sweden \u2018that I might be no obstacle or impediment to his ambitious designes\u2019.[CITATION-122] Clearly, this account reinforces many of the same points as the 1651 meeting. It reaffirms that the discussion over monarchical government was ongoing in the early 1650s and had not concluded in 1649. The kingless government that Whitelocke helped to bring about was a stop-gap; his preference was, and remained, a restoration of monarchy with a Stuart candidate on the throne. Yet the account of the 1652 conversation was not simply a means to hide Whitelocke\u2019s activities under the kingless regime. It also helped Whitelocke to understate the role he went on to take during the Protectorate, particularly his central involvement in the offer of kingship to Cromwell in 1657.In 1660 Whitelocke\u2019s role in the offer of the Crown was inescapable. Not only was there proof enough in the Commons\u2019 Journal, there also emerged shortly after the Restoration an anonymous tract entitled, which demonstrated the extent of his support for Cromwellian kingship.[CITATION-123] This work purported to be a faithful account of the deliberations between Cromwell and a committee of ninety-nine MPs over Parliament\u2019s offer of the Crown in 1657. As the title-page announced, the case for Cromwell accepting the kingly title was \u2018Made good by the Arguments\u2019 of many MPs, including Whitelocke. Not only did this pamphlet mark the first time that a wider audience was exposed to the precise details of those debates, but it also contained what was then one of the lengthiest collection of words attributable to Whitelocke available in print. Indeed, Whitelocke, who was the chairman of the committee of ninety-nine MPs, has been suggested as the pamphlet\u2019s author.[CITATION-124] Recently, Ben Woodford has argued that the author was probably \u2018one of the committee members, as they had reason to print their pro-kingship comments in 1660\u2019.[CITATION-125] Claims of Whitelocke\u2019s authorship have been strengthened by the fact that the account of the kingship debates in his memoirs is conspicuously brief. In his manuscript \u2018Diary\u2019 he simply notes that when \u2018the Com[mit]tee attended his H[ighnes]s Wh[itleocke] spake to him uppon the point of the Title of King, giving reasons why he should accept of that Title, the Prot[ecto]r urged his reasons against it, & Wh[itelocke] replyed\u2019. He says no more, adding glibly that the \u2018whole debate is in print\u2019\u2014a clear reference to.[CITATION-126] We should be wary of taking Whitelocke\u2019s concision as a sign that he approved of\u2019s contents. Perhaps he was embarrassed by its publication. After all, the committee\u2019s spokesmen asserted not only the legal necessity of the kingly title, but also the security that it provideda Stuart restoration. Lord Broghill, for instance, urged Cromwell to accept the title because \u2018there is at present but a divorce between the pretending King and Imperiall Crown of these Nations, and we know that persons divorc\u2019t may marry again, but if the person be married to another, it cuts off all hope\u2019.[CITATION-127] These were hardly sentiments that Broghill and others would have wanted to publicise in 1660. Those who commented upon the contents ofquestioned the royalist credentials of the committee members. Summarising the pamphlet\u2019s contents in his acerbicof 1663, James Heath perceived that the \u2018main argument\u2019 for kingship was built upon theAct, \u2018by which all persons were indempnified that took up Arms for the King in being, which was one and the chief reason said Whitlock, why so many at first assisted the King against the Parliament, and would be his Highnesses care and security\u2019.[CITATION-128] As the introductory note \u2018to the Reader\u2019 ofsuggests, it was \u2018out of love to themselves, and [their] posterity\u2019 that MPs offered Cromwell the Crown.[CITATION-129] Woodford has argued that the printing ofwould have benefited those whose speeches it records because it \u2018aligned the committee members with monarchical government, regardless of which family wore the crown\u2019.[CITATION-130] But revealing oneself to be a supporter of monarchical government regardless of the family hardly proved one\u2019s loyalty to the restored Stuart monarch; thus, when the pamphlet was republished in 1680 during the Exclusion Crisis, its title was changed to. The committee of ninety-nine, the preface to the reprint explained, desired \u2018Oliver the late Usurper\u2019 to take the kingly title \u2018with an intent to exclude the Royal line\u2019; it was \u2018not Monarchy alone they first struck at, but the utter Exclusion of the Royal Line\u2019.[CITATION-131] Indeed, perhaps there is an alternative explanation for the publication ofin 1660. Rather than an attempt by Cromwellian confidants to save their political careers, its publication may have been designed to destroy them.[CITATION-132] This would explain why Whitelocke does not linger on the kingship debates in his memoirs. He rarely mentions the offer of the Crown explicitly, noting only in vague terms his efforts to \u2018promote the great buisnes of settlem[en]t of the Nation\u2019.[CITATION-133] He stresses that this was a work that he took no pleasure in. He grew \u2018tyred in this very great buisnes\u2019; he had \u2018much trouble ... in this great buisnes, uppon w[hi]ch he was putt by the L[or]d Broghill & others of his friends\u2019.[CITATION-134] Whitelocke studiously avoids stating his support for the scheme; he even \u2018declined\u2019 the \u2018first delivery of the Pet[itio]n and advice to the Parlem[en]t ... not liking severall things in it\u2019\u2014although he conspicuously fails to state what exactly he disliked.[CITATION-135] In 1660, as he struggled to defend himself against his enemies, Whitelocke\u2019s key defence was to emphasise both his good intentions towards the Stuarts and the suspicions that others harboured of his latent royalism. He claimed to have done his best in difficult circumstances; he upheld the law while secretly hoping for a Stuart restoration. The publication ofwas a hammer blow to those claims. Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs were, to a large extent, an attempt to repair the damage done to his reputation by that pamphlet.Whitelocke\u2019s account of his conversation with Cromwell in November 1652 seems designed to distract from the events of 1657. For anyone familiar with the contents of, the effect of reading this conversation would have been disorientating; the roles of Cromwell and Whitelocke in 1657 are reversed. On the one hand, Cromwell stresses the legal benefits of the kingly title, making arguments akin to those advanced in 1657 by the committee of ninety-nine, most notably the legal protection offered by the 1495Act. On the other hand, contrary to his speeches in 1657, Whitelocke plays down the legal necessity of the kingly title and claims that Cromwell has as much power, if not more, without it.[CITATION-136] Most importantly of all, whereas MPs recommended Cromwell take the Crown in 1657 to prevent a Stuart monarchy, in his account of the 1652 conversation Whitelocke urges Cromwell to shun kingship and to enthrone Charles Stuart instead.Yet just as it seems unlikely that Cromwell aimed at kingship in 1652, it is doubtful that Whitelocke advised the restoration of Stuart monarchy. For one thing, Whitelocke is inconsistent on this point. As already noted, when seeking to convince the Convention Parliament not to exclude him from the Act of General Pardon, he merely asserted that \u2018Cromwellhim to incline to the Kings restauration\u2019.[CITATION-137] One is left pondering why Whitelocke did not say more. If, as his memoirs claim, he had on at least two occasions\u2014in December 1651 and November 1652\u2014spoken in favour of a Stuart restoration, it would surely have benefited him to make those details public in 1660; to show he had explicitly advised Cromwell to restore Stuart monarchy, and not to leave his defence hanging upon the thread of mere suspicion.Rather, it seems that the details of the 1651 and 1652 meetings with Cromwell were fabricated, if not wholly invented, after Whitelocke\u2019s experiences at the hands of his enemies in 1660. This was not only a response to the emergence ofbut also a chance for Whitelocke to strike at his chief antagonist in 1660, George Monck. Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs demonstrated that he worked to bring about a Stuart restoration long before Monck ever had the wherewithal to pull it off. He invites the reader to consider whether Monck\u2019s actions were more opportunistic than principled. After all, in the 1652 conversation Whitelocke advised Cromwell to seek a private treaty with Charles II to secure his own interests and those of his friends. Monck in 1660 merely seized the opportunity that Cromwell failed to take in 1652: to make himself and his posterity \u2018as great & permanent to all humane probability as ever any subject was\u2019.[CITATION-138] The opportunistic and self-interested nature of Monck\u2019s actions was made more explicit in a later conversation in Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs, dated 22 December 1659, in the final days of the Committee of Safety. With Monck and his forces gathering on the Scottish border, Whitelocke advised Charles Fleetwood \u2018to send forthwith to the King att Breda, to offer to bring him in uppon good termes, & therby to gett before hand with Moncke\u2019. It was \u2018more prudence for Fletewood & his friends to be the instrum[en]ts of bringing him in, then to leave it to Moncke\u2019. By these means, \u2018Fletewood might make termes with the K[ing] for preservation of himselfe & his friends, & of that cause in a good measure in which they had bin ingaged\u2019; but \u2018if it were left to Moncke, they & all that had been done, would be left to the daunger of destruction\u2019.[CITATION-139] By the end of their meeting, Fleetwood resolved to \u2018send Wh[itelocke] to the K[ing]\u2019; but, upon leaving, Whitelocke \u2018met Vane, Disborow, & Berry, in the next roome comming to speake with Fletewood\u2019. Predictably enough, \u2018within a quarter of an hour, Fletewood came to Wh[itelocke] & in much passion said to him, I cannot doe it, I cannot doe it\u2019. Whitelocke\u2019s response was that \u2018you will ruine your selfe & your friends\u2019 and \u2018so they parted\u2019.[CITATION-140] Whether or not this encounter was another fabrication, it is striking how Whitelocke admits to advocating an accommodation with Charles II out of political calculation. Fleetwood had to beat Monck to Breda \u2018for preservation of himself and his friends\u2019 and to safeguard the cause for which they fought.[CITATION-141] All this echoes what Whitelocke advised Cromwell in 1652. In fact, it could be argued that both the 1651 and 1652 meetings provide necessary context for this later conversation, giving it a more favourable spin than if taken in isolation. After all, if Whitelocke only advised Charles II\u2019s restoration in late 1659, when the government was on the brink of collapse and the king\u2019s return seemed inevitable, then he was being just as opportunistic as Monck. If, however, Whitelocke could demonstrate that he hadsought to restore Stuart monarchy, and had advocated such a design on a number of occasions during the 1650s, then his advice in 1659 could be read in a more favourable light. It was Whitelocke\u2019s misfortune, so he claimed, that his designs were thwarted by the ambition of Cromwell in the early 1650s and the weak-mindedness of Fleetwood in 1659. As his defence to Parliament in 1660 explained, he was resigned to \u2018submit to what it pleased God to permit, & was not in his power to alter\u2019.[CITATION-142] Ultimately, Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs do not simply rewrite the political history of the Interregnum, they reimagine the road to the Restoration too. Having almost fallen victim to Monck\u2019s efforts to have him excluded from the Act of General Pardon, thanks in no small part to his own attempts in late 1659 to denounce Monck\u2019s plans to bring about Charles II\u2019s restoration, Whitelocke tried to turn the tables. Rather than being the man who almost let the cat out of the bag about Monck\u2019s intentions, Whitelocke suggested that he had long been striving to bring about what Monck only achieved at the eleventh hour. In his reinvention of events, it was Whitelocke who was the Stuart loyalist, not the opportunist Monck.This article has suggested that key episodes in Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs are fabrications designed to promote certain narratives that served his purposes after the Restoration. It might be asked whether Whitelocke, an eminent lawyer and devout puritan, was capable of devising and propagating such blatant mistruths. Despite the anomalies and discrepancies outlined here, without the clinching evidence of an earlier manuscript, written before the Restoration, it is difficult to prove conclusively that Whitelocke\u2019s activities and opinions at or nearer the time differed from those recorded in the \u2018Annales\u2019 and \u2018Diary\u2019. Whitelocke must have based his memoirs on a range of sources; it is inconceivable that he produced such detailed works from recall alone. Yet, as Whitelocke admits, the precautionary destruction of many of his papers in January 1660 left his account \u2018lesse perfect\u2019 than it might have been.[CITATION-143] One notable absence among Whitelocke\u2019s surviving papers is the \u2018journall of the affayres of my owne life\u2019, alluded to in the \u2018Annales\u2019, in which he set down daily \u2018where I was, with what company, in what intertainm[en]t & the like\u2019. He apparently kept this record until May 1649, when he decided to end the \u2018course of writing\u2019 it because he was feeling overwhelmed by the death of his second wife and \u2018weary & clogged with a multitude of publique buisneses\u2019.[CITATION-144] Clearly, this would have been a valuable source for Whitelocke when writing his memoirs, but it is not certain whether it was available to him. Given its coverage of the key period of late 1648 and early 1649, it was probably among the incriminating papers destroyed on the eve of the Restoration.[CITATION-145] Yet, while the materials upon which Whitelocke based his memoirs remain elusive, other manuscripts from before 1660 have survived. Particularly important are several volumes in which Whitelocke recorded his embassy to Sweden in 1653\u20134. As already noted, his role as ambassador was problematic for Whitelocke after the Restoration. Enemies claimed that the enterprise was an attempt to secure the kingless regime in Britain and to close off foreign support for the Stuart cause. Prior to 1660, Whitelocke amassed much material on the embassy, including a journal written at, or very near, the time of his journey and a more expansive, two-volume \u2018History Of Whitelockes Ambassy from England to Sweden\u2019, which fleshed out the earlier notes and inserted chapters on a range of political, religious and philosophical topics.[CITATION-146] Like Whitelocke\u2019s other writings, this was ostensibly for the instruction of his family, but there are hints that the notes were intended to justify his conduct to a wider audience.[CITATION-147] Internal evidence shows that the \u2018History\u2019 was written around the time of Richard Cromwell\u2019s Protectorate.[CITATION-148] After the Restoration, however, Whitelocke went through the text and amended it, deleting some passages and revising others. Many of those changes were incorporated into the post-Restoration iteration of Whitelocke\u2019s account, subsequently printed in 1772 as.[CITATION-149] Interestingly, in the \u2018Annales\u2019 Whitelocke mentions very little about his time abroad.[CITATION-150] Instead, he deliberately \u2018sett downe the passages relating to the Parlem[en]t & Army by themselves, & those relating to the Swedish Ambassaye by themselves, that both the one & the other may be the more cleerly & distinctly understood\u2019.[CITATION-151] The manuscript subsequently published as Whitelocke\u2019s journal of the Swedish embassy was thus intended as a companion volume to the corresponding section of the \u2018Annales\u2019, probably written at the same time, and employing the same editorial practices, as the rest of Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs.While there is insufficient room in this article to explore the various textual differences between the versions of Whitelocke\u2019s account of his embassy, a few examples will suffice to show that he not only made substantial alterations to his earlier notes of key conversations during the embassy, but that those changes amplified the narratives already identified elsewhere in his post-1660 memoirs. For instance, Whitelocke records a private meeting with Queen Christina on 5 January 1654. The pre-1660 account, in the \u2018History Of Whitelockes Ambassy\u2019, opens with Christina keen to discuss Cromwell and his family. Whitelocke assured the Queen that Cromwell was a \u2018gentleman of an antient & noble family\u2019, that his wife, Elizabeth Bourchier, was of a \u2018Noble & good family\u2019 and that their children were \u2018of good parts & liberall education\u2019. Whitelocke noted that the Queen \u2018seemed by this discourse which was large, to be convinced of the untrueth of some unworthy mention which had bin made of them to her\u2019. Then:Wh[itelocke] told her that much of the story of his Generall had some paralell in that of her M[ajes]auncestor Gustavus the first, who from a private gentleman of a Noble family, which her M[ajes]knew better then he, was advanced to the title of Marshall of Sweden, bicause he had risen up for the rescue of his countrey from the bondage & oppression, which the Tirant Danish King had putt uppon them, whome he as Generall of the Swedes had subdued, & expelled the Kingdome, & for his reward, was att last elected to be their King.The Queen approved of this comparison, saying that \u2018it was very true & a good paralel, & she believed, that Cromwell would be King of England in the conclusion\u2019. Whitelocke, who had not yet received news of the foundation of the Protectorate, responded that Cromwell could not be king \u2018bicause England was resolved into a Commonwealth to be governed as a free state without a King, & that Cromwell had already as Generall of all their forces both by land and sea a sufficient power & greatnes to content him\u2019. Christina was unconvinced, saying \u2018that hardly could any power or greatnes be called sufficient, when the nature of man was so prone as in these dayes to ambition\u2019. Whitelocke \u2018hoped that there was no such in his General\u2019. Yet, Christina felt \u2018that might easily be concealed, untill an occasion were given, & then it would show it selfe\u2019.[CITATION-152] The post-1660 renditions made significant alterations to this account. The opening part of the discussion was pared down, omitting the adjectives \u2018antient\u2019 \u2018noble\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019 when discussing the Cromwells and Bourchiers. In fact, despite Whitelocke noting in the earlier version that the \u2018discourse\u2019 about Cromwell\u2019s pedigree \u2018was large\u2019, the later versions offered no additional dialogue on this topic. Elsewhere, he disassociated himself from comments favourable to Cromwell altogether, such as his comparison between Oliver and Christina\u2019s great-grandfather, Gustavus I. Instead, Whitelocke placed his words into the mouth of the Queen. The edited text of \u2018Whitelockes History Of the Embassy\u2019 demonstrates his methods, deleting the words \u2018Wh[itelocke] told her\u2019 as well as the response to the speech where \u2018the Queen said that it was very true & a good paralel\u2019.[CITATION-153] The effect of these modifications, carried over into the printed version of the Swedish journal, made it appear that it was actually the Queen who told Whitelocke that:Much of the story of your generall hath some paralell with that of my auncestor Gustavus the first, who, from a private gentleman of a noble family, was advanced to the title of marshall of Sweden, bicause he had risen up and rescued his country from the bondage and oppression which the king of Denmarke had putt uppon them, and expelled the king; and, for his reward, he was att last elected king of Sweden; and I believe that your generall will be king of England in conclusion.[CITATION-154] In the earlier version, the Queen followed Whitelocke\u2019s lead in drawing a comparison between Cromwell and her ancestor. Her insistence that Cromwell would become king was not spontaneous but was prompted by Whitelocke\u2019s analogy. In the later versions, by contrast, Whitelocke\u2019s praise for Cromwell is glossed over, as is the fact that he first hinted at Cromwellian kingship.[CITATION-155] It seems that Whitelocke was again trying to deflect attention from the events of 1657. Asrevealed, Whitelocke made a speech on 16 April 1657 in which he urged Cromwell to take the kingly title in imitation of Gustavus I, \u2018a private Gentleman of a noble Family\u2019 who \u2018took up arms with his Countrymen against a Tyrant\u2019 and was first given the \u2018Title of\u2019, but afterwards \u2018their Parliament, judging it best to resume the old title, elected this Gentleman to be their King\u2019.[CITATION-156] By amending the later versions of his Swedish journal, Whitelocke complicated the picture, hinting that it was actually Queen Christina who told Whitelocke what he subsequently told Cromwell: that Swedish history provided a powerful exemplar of the necessity for Cromwell to take the Crown.The revised version of the conversation also emphasised Cromwell\u2019s ambition. In the pre-1660 \u2018History\u2019, Whitelocke told Christina that Cromwell \u2018could not be\u2019 king because England was a Commonwealth and he already had \u2018sufficient power\u2019 as Lord General. In the later, post-Restoration, version of the dialogue, the Queen then reiterated her point\u2014\u2018[r]esolve what you will, I believe he resolves to be king\u2019\u2014before adding, as in the earlier version, that the \u2018nature of man is so prone\u2019 to ambition. As in the earlier version, Whitelocke stated that he found \u2018no such matter in my generall\u2019, to which Christina responded that it might \u2018easily be concealed till an opportunity serve, and then it will show itselfe\u2019. In the original version Whitelocke did not comment on this, but after the Restoration he added a line of dialogue in which he conceded that \u2018All are mortall men, subject to affections\u2019.[CITATION-157] Before 1660, however, Whitelocke seems to have been much surer of Cromwell\u2019s lack of ambition. If, as he later claimed, Cromwell intimated desires of being king in November 1652, Whitelocke did not reveal this in his discussions with Christina. This is not to say that he was unwilling to divulge details of his private conversations with Cromwell to the Queen. In fact, in a subsequent conversation with the Queen concerning her abdication, Whitelocke reveals that \u2018a little before my comming out of England, my General told me, that he was resolved to quitt his charge, & to retire himselfe, from the which I endeavoured to dissuade him\u2019.[CITATION-158] Conspicuously, no record of this conversation can be found in Whitelocke\u2019s \u2018Annales\u2019 or \u2018Diary\u2019: the only conversation of substance recorded with Cromwell prior to Whitelocke\u2019s departure as Swedish ambassador, aside from the deliberations on the eve of the dissolution of the Rump, is that in St James\u2019s Park.[CITATION-159] If we are to reconcile this discrepancy in Whitelocke\u2019s testimony before and after 1660, we must accept that Cromwell sought the Crown at one moment only to contemplate retirement from public life at the next. It is often said that Cromwell had a split personality, but this seems unlikely: more probable is that Whitelocke invented one, or both, encounters. Clearly, it suited his purposes in the 1650s to emphasise Cromwell\u2019s lack of ambition, just as it was prudent to stress Cromwell\u2019s ambition after 1660. Less clear is which account was true, if either.In summary, the textual variations between the accounts of the Swedish embassy produced before 1660 and those produced later reveal editorial practices consistent with those suggested in this article for other parts of Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs. They demonstrate that Whitelocke was not above altering earlier records of conversations, even switching speakers to pass off his own opinions as those of others. That his interlocutor was still alive and able to contradict his version of the conversation should it have circulated more widely did not deter Whitelocke in this case.[CITATION-160] It makes it all the more probable that Whitelocke fabricated the words of those, like Cromwell, who were long dead. More broadly, the changes that Whitelocke made to the content of his post-Restoration account of the Swedish embassy tend towards the same narrative strategies identified in the conversations with Cromwell elsewhere in his memoirs. They suggest that Cromwell coveted power and that Whitelocke was set against the idea of Cromwellian kingship. Elsewhere in his Swedish journal, the text was altered to remove criticism of the Stuart cause, while passages where Whitelocke defended the change of government in 1649, and even the regicide, were expunged or heavily edited.[CITATION-161] Clearly, Whitelocke was not beyond fabricating or revising his past with an eye to the present. That he did so when writing up his notes of the Swedish embassy makes it likely that similar processes were at work with the \u2018Annales\u2019 too, of which the Swedish journal was a companion.This article has argued that Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs are far more treacherous than has been acknowledged. The many inconsistencies and incongruities in both the content and context of Whitelocke\u2019s accounts of meetings with Cromwell in 1651 and 1652 raise the strong probability that they are, at worst, complete inventions or, at best, the reworking of material borrowed from earlier and later events. The conference in 1651 echoes meetings held in late 1648; the conversation of 1652 is strikingly similar to the kingship debates of 1657.By fabricating these accounts, Whitelocke bolstered several claims first made in 1660, when he struggled to defend himself against exclusion from the Act of Pardon. Primarily, Whitelocke sought to affirm that Cromwell\u2019s seizure of power in late 1653, not the events of 1649, was the revolutionary pivot of the period. The settlement established in 1649, so Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs suggest, was nothing more than a stop-gap, as evidenced by the fact that conversations continued into 1651 and 1652 about constitutional settlement, with mixed monarchical solutions still foremost in the minds of Cromwell and many MPs. Whatever his involvement in the kingless Commonwealth, Whitelocke claimed that it was never intended to bar the way for the return of monarchy in the future.Linked to this, the accounts of the 1651 and 1652 meetings helped Whitelocke to demonstrate his enduring loyalty to the Stuart cause. While in 1660 Whitelocke merely claimed that Cromwellhim of harbouring a desire for a Stuart Restoration, in the memoirs he made plain to Cromwell those desires on not one, but two, occasions. This revelation was also designed to discredit his main antagonist in 1660, George Monck. In response to Monck\u2019s claim that Whitelocke had almost frustrated the whole business of the king\u2019s return, Whitelocke demonstrated that he always harboured hopes for a Stuart restoration. He had advocated such a course of action not only in 1659, but also in 1651 and 1652 when the royalist cause was at its lowest ebb following Worcester. Whitelocke suggested that he strove to bring about the Restoration long before Monck had the opportunity to do so.The account of the two meetings also strengthened Whitelocke\u2019s claim in 1660 that Cromwell schemed for power and that, consequently, he fell out of favour because he was an obstacle to Cromwell\u2019s ambitious plans. This narrative was dealt a blow by the publication of the kingship debates of 1657, which revealed that Whitelocke not only urged Cromwell to take the Crown but also that Cromwell had repeatedly refused that offer. It is therefore understandable that Whitelocke said little about the events of 1657 in his memoirs. That Whitelocke\u2019s \u2018Annales\u2019 apparently come to an abrupt end when the account reaches 1656 may indicate that the main narratives of Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs\u2014namely Cromwellian ambition and Whitelocke\u2019s latent Stuart sympathies\u2014became impossible to sustain in light of the details printed in.[CITATION-162] Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1652 conversation was probably an attempt to muddy the waters.Once Whitelocke\u2019s accounts of the 1651 and 1652 meetings are discounted, however, the political history of the 1650s is transformed. Removing Whitelocke\u2019s evidence of backroom discussions over constitutional change in 1651, the kingless regime established in 1649 no longer seems like a stop-gap; there is little to suggest an appetite among MPs for constitutional change, much less for a Stuart restoration, post-Worcester. Much of the evidence outside of Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs, including the legal preparations for kingless government, the Act abolishing kingship, the Rump\u2019sof March 1649, the declarations against Charles Stuart in 1651, and the decision to export kingless government to Scotland after Worcester, undermine the notion that Whitelocke and others entertained mixed monarchical solutions and the enthroning of a Stuart king. The regime was not freewheeling, putting off the business of settlement for the future: the regime established in 1649, which Whitelocke helped to secure, was intended to besettlement. After Worcester, debate hinged uponwithin the existing constitutional arrangement, not aof government.True, a scheme to make Cromwell king emerged in 1657, but this was the product of developmentsthe dissolution of the Rump, not of a longing for such a solution among Rumpers, much less the secret machinations of Cromwell. Discounting Whitelocke\u2019s testimony, there is no evidence that Cromwell personally expressed a preference for the Crown. He did not even seek power in the first instance: the dissolution of the Rump led him to back the scheme for a Nominated Assembly to carry out necessary reforms, but his intention was to revert to government by unicameral sovereign parliaments thereafter. It was the failure of the Nominated Assembly that drove Cromwell and his allies to entertain constitutional arrangements that set up a single person to check Parliament\u2019s legislative authority. Even then Cromwell did not covet the Crown. The offer of kingship embodied in theof 1657 was devised by a number of Cromwellian acolytes, nervous about the regime\u2019s security should the Protector die suddenly, and a majority of Presbyterian MPs who saw kingship as a means to bind Cromwell by settling the government on a parliamentary footing.[CITATION-163] Yet, no matter how strongly Whitelocke and other MPs recommended such a scheme, Cromwell ultimately refused. Discounting Whitelocke\u2019s evidence, it seems most likely that Cromwell\u2019s refusal was the product of providential reasoning rather than political calculation. While Cromwell may have sought out solutions to keep monarchy in being in late 1648, once the decision was taken to abolish kingship he never sought to reinstate what providence had destroyed.[CITATION-164] Above all, this article suggests that scholars must reflect more on the ways in which the memory games played out in the Restoration era continue to taint histories of the 1640s and 50s. While some have suggested that Whitelocke did \u2018surprisingly little\u2019 to revise his \u2018own past with an eye to the present\u2019 or to omit \u2018potentially damaging material\u2019, it seems his methods were far more subtle and therefore less easy to detect.[CITATION-165] In the tense atmosphere of 1660, as Whitelocke struggled to save his life and livelihood, he concocted a number of claims to conceal or diminish his role in the events of the 1640s and 50s while conforming to many of the \u2018public\u2019 memories of the two decades that were propagated in official and semi-official print during the Restoration period. Whitelocke never denied his proximity to Cromwell or that he served the various regimes in the 1650s: these were too well known. Instead, he turned his position as a Cromwellian insider to his advantage, telling stories about private meetings that obfuscated much of the detail that was public knowledge.Even though Whitelocke\u2019s attempts to rehabilitate himself in his own lifetime failed, his literary efforts to reimagine the Interregnum, and his role within it, have had a highly influential afterlife. Echoes of the narratives that Whitelocke sought to establish in his memoirs, including the transient nature of the kingless Commonwealth regime, the ingrained and enduring support for monarchical government even among members of the Rump, and Oliver Cromwell\u2019s desire for the Crown, all still pervade historical studies of the period. Even where scholars look on Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs sceptically, they still broadly accept many of the stories that he told about the 1640s and 50s. As historians now consider the myriad ways in which the civil wars were memorialised and commemorated, it is worth reflecting on how the historical studies we write today are often themselves propagators of post-Restoration memories and narratives about the period."

    "text": "Their slaves are. Their purchases redemptions. Surely this contemptible system needs only to be exposed to cease to exist.Thomas P. Thompson (1809)[CITATION-1] With regard to many of the apprenticed children, there is very great reason for anxious fear as to what becomes of them; little or no notice being taken of them officially after they have been put out. It is well known, that many of the poor natives who take them as apprentices, imagine that the money which they pay for the indenture, constitutes a kind of purchase of the child, and that they are then at liberty to do with him or her whatever they please. There is ground to fear that not a few are by some means taken away from the colony, and again made victims of the horrid trade in human beings.Hannah Kilham (1830)[CITATION-2] Unbeknown to British abolitionists, the passage of the 1807 Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade instigated the forced migration and colonisation of tens of thousands of African children. Following the passage of the Act, the Royal Navy\u2019s anti-slavery squadron diverted more than 500 intercepted slave vessels from the Atlantic coast of Africa to the abolitionist-founded colony of Sierra Leone. In total, at least 35,000 children reached Sierra Leone, part of a larger forced migration of 99,000 \u2018Liberated\u2019 Africans who disembarked at Freetown between 1808 and 1863.[CITATION-3] The arrival of so many young recaptives posed the humanitarian and colonial-economic question of how to resettle these children. The solution proposed by British abolitionists was telling: apprenticeship. As Cooper, Holt and Scott point out, for abolitionists \u2018the transition [to free labour] had to be a directed one,\u2019 and apprenticeship served as both a policy prescription and a metaphor for the process.[CITATION-4] Concepts that had underpinned and justified slavery\u2014infantilisation, paternalism and guardianship\u2014also framed British anti-slavery policy.[CITATION-5] In Sierra Leone, British colonial administrators, drawing on their familiarity with the ancient British legal instrument and institution, saw apprenticeship as a form of training in agriculture, craft or skills.[CITATION-6] But apprenticeship was also a concept (or conceit) designed to allow British officials to impart to colonial inhabitants the cadence and decorum of daily life in a post-slavery society. As they did elsewhere in the empire, abolitionists and colonial officials justified the unpaid labour of the apprenticeship system by insisting that it was a form of instruction. For young Liberated Africans taken from the holds of intercepted slave vessels, this instruction was meant to be tutelage in a particular occupation or trade, as well as in the norms of Anglo-Christian dress, speech and behaviour. Apprenticeship in Sierra Leone was thus conceived as both a system of labour and a process of socialisation.If apprenticeship was central to abolitionist theory, in Sierra Leone it became a central feature of colonial practice. Part of this was by design. Apprenticeship was a key tenet of the 1807 Abolition Act, though the Act paid scant regard to what was actually to be done with Africans taken from intercepted slave ships.[CITATION-7] Indenture increasingly became a policy of necessity as British navy vessels escorted more and more slave ships to Freetown harbour. The nineteenth-century slave trade was to an unprecedented degree a trade in children. Benjamin Lawrance observes that what historians often herald as an age of abolition after 1807 could more accurately be called the age of child enslavement.[CITATION-8] As the Royal Navy diverted a transatlantic trade whose victims were younger than in past centuries, the question of what to do with Liberated Africans was, to a great extent, a question of what to do with children orphaned by their enslavement and forced migration.Much of the recent scholarship on Liberated Africans and British abolition has focused on the judicial and monetary mechanisms of naval interdiction and on questions of identity-formation and \u2018creolisation\u2019 within Liberated African communities around the Atlantic.[CITATION-9] This article, by contrast, focuses on the experiences of Liberated African children. It argues that the history of children and childhood should be central to histories of abolition and empire.[CITATION-10] While children have often been on the fringes of historical discourse, historians of slavery and abolition have recently come to examine their experiences more closely.[CITATION-11] Focusing on children \u2018invigorates debates about the nature of liberty insofar as emancipated former child slaves were rarely truly free and autonomous\u2019.[CITATION-12] This article explores the types of freedom that were possible for children brought to Sierra Leone and apprenticed there in the period from 1808 to the abandonment of apprenticeship in 1848.This article argues that apprenticeship in Sierra Leone was, primarily, an exploitative system that rested on the unremunerated labour of Liberated African youth and exacerbated the vulnerability of liberated children. Apprentice labour was integral to the growth of Freetown\u2019s economy as an Atlantic port city. Unpaid child labour facilitated the growing prosperity of a select number of Freetown\u2019s Nova Scotian, Maroon, European and, later, Liberated African merchants. At the same time, the very term apprentice concealed a spectrum of experiences, from mutually beneficial economic arrangements to conditions of violence and exploitation that were in many ways analogous to slavery. Youths whose liberation was highly coerced could, in certain cases, attain some sense of belonging through their periods of indenture in and around Freetown. Others, aware of their legal status and the terms of their indentures, sought redress for ill-treatment both through the colonial courts and by running away. Despite the asymmetries of power and the precariousness of youth torn away from their kin, apprentices as well as masters and governors shaped the indenture system.Liberated African apprenticeship developed within a wider British imperial context of colonial administrations envisioning an empire without slavery. Sierra Leone was the first location in sub-Saharan Africa where the British attempted to import a concept of apprenticeship, and they did so prior to the more famous and far more studied case of the British Caribbean, as well as the Cape Colony and Mauritius between 1834 and 1838.[CITATION-13] Unlike the West Indies, the Cape, or Mauritius, Sierra Leone did not have to contend with the transition from slave to \u2018free labour\u2019 society.[CITATION-14] The local variant of apprenticeship practice was that, while apprentices at the Cape and in the Caribbean were indentured to the very people who had held them as slaves, apprentices in Sierra Leone were given over to strangers. Moreover, while apprenticeship in the West Indies applied just as much to adults as it did to children, in Sierra Leone it was a policy prescription primarily for Liberated Africans too young for military enlistment, public works or agricultural labour. Apprenticeship in Sierra Leone, as elsewhere in the empire, was dictated by local factors such as the size of the population, the nature of the local economy, and both metropolitan and local law.Abolitionists formulated apprenticeship policies against a backdrop of shifting metropolitan conceptions of indenture and child labour. In England, parish apprenticeship was a centuries-old practice used to manage poverty and poor relief at the local level, and particularly to alleviate the burden of orphaned or impoverished children on local taxpayers.[CITATION-15] In colonial North America, pauper apprenticeship was widely used to redirect the lives of poor children who were illegitimate, orphaned, abandoned, abused, or otherwise considered by authorities to be at risk. From the early 1600s until well into the 1800s, local authorities in England and in Anglo-America regarded pauper apprenticeship as an acceptable, even a desirable, way to raise the children of the poor.[CITATION-16] In Britain, apprenticeship declined in the industrial era, as legislation and social policy became increasingly hostile to the principle of parish apprenticeships.[CITATION-17] At the same time, there is evidence that the decades leading up to the 1840s saw a peak of child employment and a declining age of first participation in employment.[CITATION-18] Apprenticeship in Sierra Leone also had antecedents and parallels in Saint-Louis, Gor\u00e9e, Luanda, and other Atlantic African port communities where urban slavery undergirded household production. Bronwen Everill has shown in the cases of Saint-Louis and Gor\u00e9e that households, often managed by women, mobilised slave labourers to expand their market activity.[CITATION-19] While apprenticeships were fixed-term, and apprentices theoretically had protections not afforded to urban slaves, apprenticeship served similar functions to enslavement in an urban economy. Expanding the household through domestic labour was common, and apprentices, like household slaves, were important contributors to household income. With time, several prominent Sierra Leonean merchants acquired large unpaid labour forces, increasingly drawn from those released by Freetown\u2019s anti-slave trade court.Different forms of indenture had existed in Sierra Leone from the colony\u2019s founding, thus pre-dating Crown rule, the 1807 Abolition Act, and the arrival of the first Liberated Africans in 1808. Before the Sierra Leone colony even existed, its architect and chief benefactor, the abolitionist Granville Sharp, suggested the \u2018redemption\u2019 of enslaved people from local slave traders and the apprenticeship of children in the region. Sharp also envisaged indentures for fugitive slaves who might seek asylum in his proposed colony.[CITATION-20] During the period of Sierra Leone Company rule (1792\u20131807), colonial settlers employed children from the region in their households. The early \u2018settler\u2019 population of Sierra Leone comprised self-emancipated \u2018Nova Scotian\u2019 Black Loyalists who had sided with the British during the American Revolutionary War in return for a promised freedom, and Jamaican Maroons whom the British government had previously forcibly removed to Nova Scotia.[CITATION-21] The apprenticeship of native youth provided a means of labour recruitment for the charter residents of a fledgling company-sponsored colony.As early as 1792, John Clarkson, the first governor of the colony, gave a \u2018captain\u2019 of the Nova Scotian settlers \u2018permission to take one of the natives as an apprentice\u2019. Clarkson reasoned that the apprenticeship of local Africans would expand the population of the \u2018infant colony\u2019.[CITATION-22] Some African \u2018apprentices\u2019 in Nova Scotian households were sent to the colony by their parents for education. Others were \u2018redeemed\u2019 from slavery by the Sierra Leone Company and bound as apprentices to Nova Scotian artisans.[CITATION-23] The informal apprenticeship of \u2018native\u2019 children continued through the period of Company rule.Apprenticeship in Sierra Leone soon took on far greater significance with the passage of the 1807 Abolition Act, the transfer of Sierra Leone to the Crown, the foundation of a Vice-Admiralty court, and the deployment of the Royal Navy to patrol the West African coast against illegal slaving voyages. In a letter of 1807 to Governor Thomas Ludlam, his predecessor Zachary Macaulay opined that \u2018the most likely means of promoting civilization in that country would be by indenting the natives for a period not exceeding seven years, or till they attained the age of 21\u2019.[CITATION-24] In proposing the establishment of a Vice-Admiralty court in Sierra Leone, Macaulay argued that Liberated Africans would be better off being taken to Freetown than to the West Indies to be apprenticed. With the \u2018system of free labour being already established at Sierra Leone\u2019, he argued, \u2018the introduction of any number of negroes into that colony whether on the footing of free labourers or as apprentices for a limited period, could be attended with none of those inconveniences which it is alleged would flow from it in our West Indian islands\u2019.[CITATION-25] Macaulay, the former governor of Sierra Leone and now secretary to the Sierra Leone Company in England, may have been drawing upon earlier Company and settler experience with local Africans in formulating a new policy for Africans who were to be legally emancipated in a Vice-Admiralty court.Of the twenty-seven clauses in the Abolition Act, only one addressed how to \u2018receive, protect and provide for such Natives of Africa\u2019 on board confiscated ships. The Act required that Liberated Africans either enlist in the armed forces or be bound \u2018whether of full Age or not, as Apprentices, for any Term not exceeding Fourteen Years\u2019.[CITATION-26] Recognising that neither apprenticeship nor military service would be entered into voluntarily, the Act allowed third parties to agree to indentures on behalf of the captives, in accordance with terms to be defined by future Orders in Council.[CITATION-27] This arrangement was to have \u2018the same Force and Effect as if the party thereby bound voluntarily so enlisted or entered [the apprenticeship]\u2019. While enlistment took priority in the era of the Napoleonic Wars, apprenticeship was left as the sole means of resettling\u2014or \u2018disposing\u2019, in the colonial lexicon of the time\u2014the large number of children who were landed without parents. The Act also included \u2018Regulations for the future Disposal and Support of such Negroes as shall have been bound Apprentices\u2019\u2014regulations that \u2018after the term of their Apprenticeship shall have expired \u2026 may prevent such Negroes from becoming at any Time chargeable\u2019 to the public purse.The legal formalisation of apprenticeship in the Abolition Act coincided with the arrival of what would be thousands of children on board intercepted slave vessels over the next half-century. The percentage of boys and especially girls in these voyages rose strongly in the final decades of the transatlantic trade.[CITATION-28] Eltis and Engerman estimate that, for 2,201 slave shipments to the Americas between 1801 and 1864, adult males accounted for 42.5 per cent of captives, women 16.9 per cent, boys 25.2 per cent, and girls 15.4 per cent. This contrasts with earlier periods: boys constituted 8.4 per cent and 12.7 per cent of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century slave trades respectively; girls made up 4.0 per cent and 7.6 per cent of the trade in those centuries.The age of Liberated Africans in Sierra Leone reflects this nineteenth-century Atlantic trend. Between 1808 and 1863, colonial officials in Sierra Leone recorded the names, physical descriptions and estimated ages of Africans who came before Freetown\u2019s Vice-Admiralty and Mixed Commission courts. These Liberated African registers list both the gender (man/woman/boy/girl) and estimated age of 81,663 recaptives at the time of their arrival.[CITATION-29] We know little about the creation of the Sierra Leone registers and the role of clerks and translators in recording personal information, including age; but even if we acknowledge that these ages were at best informed guesses, these data nevertheless offer greater specificity than American plantation records, which often recorded slave ages in five- to ten-year intervals.[CITATION-30] In the registers, the average age was 18.83, while 39.4 per cent of those landed were 14 or under\u2014for most of the nineteenth century the official distinction between children and adults within the colony (see Appendix I).[CITATION-31] Scholars of the Atlantic world are now interrogating what constituted a \u2018child\u2019, \u2018boy\u2019, or \u2018girl\u2019 in the nineteenth-century Atlantic, and how such definitions were linked to evolving ideas about childhood in Europe and the Americas. During the period of thetransatlantic trade, slave traders of various nations identified children using criteria of age and height. The cut-off height for children was often 4 feet 4 inches, while the Royal African Company defined children as those judged to be under 14 years of age. Within Britain, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century social commentators were inconsistent in their use of the term \u2018child\u2019 and definitions of \u2018childhood\u2019. Apprenticeships in Britain tended to commence at 14, with apprentices only thought of as \u2018adult\u2019 workers upon completion, when they were aged between 21 and 24.[CITATION-32] However, during the central period of British industrialisation, the 1800s to the 1830s, the age at which children started to work reached its lowest.[CITATION-33] In Jamaica, planters, estate managers, bookkeepers and overseers designated as children the enslaved of 15 years and younger. Within the British Caribbean, definitions of enslaved child and childhood became more contingent as abolition threatened to cut off the African labour supply and planters re-evaluated the role of children in the plantation complex.[CITATION-34] The 1807 Abolition Act referred to a \u2018Child or person under the Age of Fourteen Years\u2019. In practice, colonial officials tended to revert to a distinction of 14 and under.[CITATION-35] Officials probably drew upon metropolitan and colonial norms for defining child and adult through the lens of labour and labouring age. Not unlike slave traders along the coast, they probably also relied upon Eurocentric concepts of physicality and outward signs of puberty or inferences of sexual maturity as markers.[CITATION-36] This was especially likely given the challenge of translation among recent captives from across West and West Central Africa, and even the responses that questions about age might have elicited. Liberated Africans arrived from societies where age seniority and birth order were important factors in determining status, but where birth dates and years of age were far less significant.[CITATION-37] Many pre-colonial African societies defined maturation and adulthood less in terms of biology and chronological age than as a status earned by moving up an age hierarchy or advancing through an age-grade system.Recent scholarship on age as recorded in colonial documents has highlighted how \u2018chronological age has functioned since the earliest days of European imperialism and the transatlantic slave trade as a foundational means for the unequal distribution of rights, opportunities, and authority\u2019.[CITATION-38] One contemporary observer visiting Freetown in 1834 stated that colonial officials \u2018in a glance decided the age, whether above or under fourteen\u2019.[CITATION-39] Since settlement policies were fundamentally different for adults and children, such glances dictated what \u2018liberation\u2019 actually meant for tens of thousands of adolescents. British liberation began with the cursory physical inspection of Africans recently released from the slave ship and a summary assessment of the forms of labour most suitable for their build.An Order in Council issued in March 1808 laid out the guidelines for the apprenticeship system. The Collector of Customs was to identify \u2018prudent and humane masters or mistresses\u2019 to impart \u2018such trades, handicrafts or employments, as they may seem most fit for, or most likely to gain a livelihood by, when their apprenticeships shall expire\u2019.[CITATION-40] Yet neither this Order in Council nor the Abolition Act stipulated how indentures were to be arranged, nor did the authors ever consider the possibility that would-be apprentices might refuse such a fate.[CITATION-41] The ambiguity of how to apprentice the first Liberated Africans resulted in a fiasco that looms large in the early history of the Crown colony.The first recaptives were 167 individuals taken from theand the, American slave ships captured by HMSin March 1808. The recaptives arrived before the establishment of the Vice-Admiralty court on 16 March 1808, and before the Orders in Council reached the colony.[CITATION-42] Governor Ludlam proceeded according to his own interpretation of the Abolition Act and its narrow stipulations. Forty of the ablest men were placed in government service for a period of three years. The remainder\u2014eighteen men, fourteen women, and ninety-five children\u2014were bound out as apprentices for varying periods.Ludlam\u2019s treatment of these earliest recaptives immediately sparked the ire of his successor, Thomas Perronet Thompson, who arrived in Freetown in July 1808 as the first Crown-appointed governor. The 25-year-old army and navy veteran, who was the son of a Hull banker, and a friend of William Wilberforce, was appalled at what he saw as an egregious, unprincipled settlement policy. Before leaving England, he had clashed with Zachary Macaulay, the former Company governor and member of the African Institution, because it appeared that Macaulay favoured the apprenticeship system. Thompson grew increasingly convinced that \u2018apprentice\u2019 was simply a euphemism for \u2018slave\u2019, and that apprenticeship was an insidious plot to continue slavery in the colony.[CITATION-43] On his arrival in Sierra Leone, Thompson quickly confirmed to himself the nefariousness of apprenticeship by launching into an investigation of his predecessor\u2019s handling of theandrecaptives. Thompson found that many of the Africans from HMShad been \u2018sold within the Colony\u2019 from a cattle pen at the back of Fort Thornton.[CITATION-44] The event had been an embarrassing public spectacle in an abolitionist colony. The gaoler of the fort, the Nova Scotian Jack Reed, is alleged to have proclaimed to anxious settlers and Europeans that \u2018no person is to take away any of the slaves without paying the sum of twenty Dollars\u2019.[CITATION-45] But others, too old or infirm for Freetown residents to bid on, were simply given away.[CITATION-46] Worse still, when twenty-one of those apprentices subsequently fled their masters, they were captured, clapped in irons and thrown into the town\u2019s gaol.[CITATION-47] Thompson\u2019s first dispatch to Lord Castlereagh, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, complained that theAfricans had been \u2018bought\u2019 in the colony.[CITATION-48] He also wrote accusingly to his predecessor, Ludlam, that \u2018You will say that people were, or, according to the provisions of the order in Council. If so, where are the Indentures?\u2019[CITATION-49] In August 1808, Thompson passed an ordinance\u2014one of several he published prominently in the colony\u2019s newspaper, the\u2014declaring the system of apprenticeship within the colony to be illegal, null and void.[CITATION-50] Because anti-slavery activists in Britain maintained that apprenticeship was an avenue for education and the civilising mission, they arranged for Thompson\u2019s recall in favour of a governor more amenable to the labour realities of the colony.This initial controversy over apprenticeship between Thompson and the colony\u2019s backers in London has been the focus of considerable scholarly attention and debate.[CITATION-51] Thompson\u2019s verbose objections to apprenticeship are the most substantial collection of documents on the subject by any governor or colonial official.[CITATION-52] The early controversy laid bare the ambiguities in visions of a post-emancipation society. Yet for all of Thompson\u2019s objections, this was not a watershed moment in the colony\u2019s labour history. The Liberated African registers show that apprenticeship continued on Thompson\u2019s watch, involving many of the masters who were implicated in purchasing the first apprentices. Thompson himself took at least two young female apprentices, a four-year-old named Sybell and a seven-year-old named Coota.[CITATION-53] Neither Thompson nor any of his successors abolished apprenticeship. The large numbers of arriving children and the limited capabilities of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and Methodist Missionary Society (MMS) to care for and educate them made indentures expedient, if not a necessity. At times, officials attempted to regulate the granting of indentures and to oversee master\u2013apprentice relationships. While much scholarly attention has been paid to what Thompson made of apprenticeship, there has been far less given to how subsequent governors handled the issue of apprenticeship, or how masters and apprentices shaped the practice of indenture.The process of acquiring an apprentice was regulated in the wake of the Thompson controversy. The spectacle of the auction deplored by Thompson gave way to an application system. Whether a potential master thought of this process as any less of a transaction than those who \u2018bought\u2019 the Africans of theand theis less obvious. Thomas Coke, who wrote one of the earliest mission histories of the colony, recounted that:As soon as these captured slave-ships arrive at Sierra Leone, the slaves have their chains knocked off by the command of the Governor; they are then brought on shore, and conveyed to the barracks. The fact is soon known throughout the colony. If, therefore, any of the settlers wish to have any of them, to employ them in their houses, or on their farms, they make application to the Governor, specifying the number which they want.[CITATION-54] Cattle-pen auctions were gone, but the unseemliness of the apprenticeship purchase remained.Attempts to regulate apprenticeship and ameliorate its most objectionable aspects took on several forms. For one, the duration of apprenticeships in Sierra Leone were generally shorter than those in the British Caribbean. The terms of apprenticeship for the Africans on board theand theare not known, though Zachary Macaulay thought seven years would be appropriate.[CITATION-55] The earliest Liberated African Registers only list the duration of indenture for one recaptive, a nine-year-old boy registered as \u2018Jack\u2019, who was \u2018apprenticed to Priscilla Gordon 30June [1808] for 8 years\u2019.[CITATION-56] Oversight of apprenticeships consisted of registration and documentation, rather than actual visitations or inquiries about treatment. A proclamation of June 1811 stated that anyone who could not produce an indenture certificate at the next muster of apprentices would have their apprentices taken away.[CITATION-57] The results of a muster conducted the previous month had made for disconcerting reading. Of 761 apprentices, only 512 had been \u2018produced\u2019; seventy-two had run away and 115 \u2018remained to be accounted for\u2019.[CITATION-58] Over the ensuing years, multiple governors attempted to muster apprentices to make sure they were \u2018accounted for\u2019, if not cared for. Their attempts were often short-lived or non-starters. In 1827, Joseph Reffell, who had been Chief Superintendent of the Liberated African Department since 1816, told the visiting parliamentary Commission of Inquiry of the deficiencies in the apprenticeship bureaucracy. Reffell admitted that, while indentures were usually recorded in the offices of the Liberated African Department, \u2018a great number of children however have been given out without indentures being executed\u2019.[CITATION-59] The lack of administrative oversight means it is often difficult to assess what percentage of the population was apprenticed at any given time. It is clear, however, that within five years of Liberated African arrivals, apprenticeship was ubiquitous in Freetown. The missionary Thomas Coke wrote in 1812 that \u2018there is scarcely a family throughout the settlement, however poor, that has not one, or more, of these apprentices, and some have as many as twenty\u2019.[CITATION-60] A CMS count of the population in May 1813 noted 220 male apprentices and 159 female apprentices in a Freetown population of 1,404 (including 600 adult residents).[CITATION-61] Early censuses of the colony stated the number of \u2018servants or apprentices in Freetown and suburbs\u2019 as 609, out of 6,406 recaptives counted in 1818, and 486 out of the 8,076 counted in 1820.[CITATION-62] Apprenticeship abated as an official policy in the later 1810s and early 1820s, a period coinciding with the tenure of Sierra Leone\u2019s longest-serving governor of the nineteenth century, Sir Charles MacCarthy. MacCarthy\u2019s \u2018parish plan\u2019 made the Church Missionary Society the managers of newly established parishes across the Sierra Leone peninsula, which were administered from villages and led by a missionary superintendent. The resident missionary was responsible for overseeing the apprenticeship of Liberated Africans in various trades.[CITATION-63] The agreement between the colonial government and the CMS had a particular impact on children. On 15 August 1815, Governor MacCarthy wrote to the CMS Secretary declaring that \u2018the Government has acceded to the propositions of the Society; and shall, on my part, with the highest gratification, deliver into the hands of the Missionaries all the liberated children\u2019.[CITATION-64] Much has been made of this alliance of church and state in colonial Sierra Leonean history, and missionary superintendence is taken to have been the normative experience for most Liberated Africans in the nineteenth century. But this particular arrangement with the CMS lasted only ten years, between 1816 and 1826. When the arrangement fell apart, apprenticeship became of renewed importance.Kenneth Macaulay stated in 1827 that \u2018Sir Charles MacCarthy gave up apprenticing, except in particular cases\u2019.[CITATION-65] Apprenticeship seems then to have expanded greatly in the years after MacCarthy\u2019s death in 1824. MacCarthy had spent ambitiously on his colonial vision, and the subsequent cuts to colonial expenditure saw all liberated children distributed among the inhabitants of Freetown and the villages under the apprenticeship system. Neil Campbell, one of MacCarthy\u2019s successors, ordered in 1826 that \u2018boys and girls under 15 and who may until after that age be considered unable to clear and settle a piece of land, will be distributed to old settlers, appointed by the managers, until they obtain the above age\u2019.[CITATION-66] Campbell argued that apprenticeship from an early age would instil the \u2018habits of industry\u2019.[CITATION-67] Such rhetoric helped to rationalise new provisions that boys should not be retained in school beyond the ages of 10\u201312, but at that point distributed among the adult population. The CMS missionary George Metzger noted the passage of the new instructions, which stipulated that children under 15 were to be \u2018distributed\u2019 by village managers to settlers. At 15, they were to be \u2018released from the charge of their adopted parents\u2019 and allocated a parcel of land.[CITATION-68] Metzger, who had heretofore overseen the education of Liberated African children in the villages of Kissy and Wellington, personally distributed the putative apprentices to the villagers. In a lengthy dispatch to the Secretary of State Viscount Goderich in 1831, Lieutenant Governor Alexander Findlay noted the expansion of apprenticeship, with the department\u2019s register for 31 December 1832 showing 4,700 apprentices bound under indenture for three to seven years.[CITATION-69] Census records convey the ubiquity of apprenticeship in Sierra Leone. But who in colonial society actually took apprentices? The Liberated African Registers record 3,697 apprenticeships for Liberated Africans immediately following their arrival for the years 1808 to 1848 (this is not a complete record and does not include apprenticeships made outside the colonial capital). Freetown residents intent on acquiring an apprentice appealed directly to the Liberated African Department. Applicants then visited the Liberated African yard\u2014a walled compound where recently emancipated Africans awaited their \u2018disposal\u2019\u2014to choose an individual. Here, clerks recorded their names, and at times backgrounds and occupations, in the Liberated African Registers beside the name of the apprentice they chose. Until 1813 clerks also kept an annual list headed \u2018Alterations to the Register of Liberated Negroes\u2019.[CITATION-70] These first Liberated Africans are thus unique in that we can trace their apprenticeship over several years.The early annual list of alterations to the Liberated African Registers shows that many apprenticeships in the first years did not last long. Of 888 indentures recorded between 1808 and 1811, only 409 were still in place by the end of 1812. Some were clearly broken off, while shorter indentures were fulfilled. The alterations list 164 apprenticeships \u2018taken away\u2019, while nine were \u2018cancelled\u2019 and eight indentures \u2018returned\u2019. Fifty-two apprentices \u2018ran away\u2019, and three had \u2018left his master\u2019. Thirty-two apprentices had died, while three indentures were cancelled at the death of the master. A further 101 apprentices had joined the British Navy, Royal African Corps, or West India Regiments; in these cases, it is unclear whether they broke off the indenture early. This is also true of the 103 apprentices who were now listed simply as living \u2018in the colony\u2019, with their \u2018country people\u2019, or as labourers in one of the Liberated African villages. Some indentures had been transferred to different masters. Seeka, a 14-year-old apprenticed in April 1810 to the Nova Scotian tailor Martha Burden, had been transferred to a W. Gray by December 1811.[CITATION-71] An eight-year-old boy who was among the first recaptives was initially an apprentice to the Maroon settler Rachel Jarrett, but \u2018changed his mistress and went to Robert Nicholson\u2019 nine months after his arrival.[CITATION-72] Additionally, four had \u2018Gone to England \u2026 to the Lancastrian school\u2019, among the first Liberated Africans to be educated in Britain.[CITATION-73] The early Liberated African Registers often noted whether a master was a Nova Scotian, Maroon or European. In these years, many settlers took the opportunity to expand significantly their household labour force. George Nicol, a European carpenter hired by the Sierra Leone Company, took two apprentices in 1808 and six more in 1810. With their labour and the financial backing of his wife Jane Small\u2014the daughter of a Nova Scotian who had sold their land for considerable profit\u2014Nicol grew his business and built himself two large houses on the Freetown waterfront.[CITATION-74] The abovementioned Martha Burden, a tailor who owned one of the best properties near the Freetown waterfront, took six apprentices between 1808 and 1810. The record of masters\u2019 occupations gives partial insights into the work apprentices actually did. From the 1810s onward, Maroons described officially as \u2018yeomen\u2019 took on apprentices for \u2018husbandry\u2019. In practice, these apprentices grew vegetables\u2014chiefly cassava\u2014on the small plots of land that Maroons were disinclined to farm.[CITATION-75] Many of the most prominent landowners in early colonial Freetown were women and many of the first apprentices had mistresses rather than masters.[CITATION-76] Upheaval in the Americas and migration to Sierra Leone had resulted in many female-headed households, particularly among Nova Scotians. In the late 1790s and 1800s, women owned houses and shops in Freetown, handled imported goods, and in some cases traded inland. With time, a greater social rigidity meant that female-headed households declined in number and proportion, as did women\u2019s share in the more lucrative commercial sectors. Still, many indentures were made out to women as household owners. Of the first 377 indentures recorded in the Liberated African Registers, seventy-eight (20.7 per cent) were to female Freetownians. A single volume in the Sierra Leone Public Archives with the euphemistic title \u2018Liberated African Department Statement of Disposals\u2019 records 1,166 apprenticeships for Liberated Africans landed from 17 May 1821 to 16 December 1828, of which at least 333 (28.6 per cent of indentures) were held by women.[CITATION-77] The registers reveal other dynamics: women often took female apprentices, in keeping with British norms regarding domesticity and gendered divisions of labour.[CITATION-78] When the Portuguese schoonerarrived in December 1825, twenty-six women in Freetown each took a female apprentice from on board.[CITATION-79] Christopher Fyfe has argued that \u2018recaptive prosperity had been built up on unpaid apprentice labour\u2019, as entrepreneurial recaptives used the system to accumulate a number of unpaid dependents.[CITATION-80] James Edward Alexander, who briefly visited the colony in 1840, observed that:so industrious are some of the liberated Africans, that instances have occurred of men only three months out of a slave ship, and about to be sent to the country, going to the slave yard with ten shillings in their hand, (collected by cutting and selling wood, &c.) and saying, \u201cMe want \u2019cruit,\u201d or a recruit or apprentice to be servant to him, and as a present to his mammy, or wife.[CITATION-81] Leading Freetown merchants such as Kenneth Macaulay\u2014head of the prosperous Freetown firm Macaulay & Babington\u2014and the timber trader John McCormack acquired sizeable unpaid labour forces, often taking multiple apprentices from a single arriving slave ship. In May of 1826, Macaulay and McCormack took fourteen and nine adult male apprentices respectively from the Brazilian brig. In total, Macaulay took at least fifty-four apprentices and McCormack nineteen between 1821 and 1828.[CITATION-82] Liberated African traders acquired their own household child labour forces. John French, one of a handful of Liberated Africans recorded as a shopkeeper in the 1831 census, resided on Liverpool Street in central Freetown in a household of nineteen, including seven apprentices. All seven were listed with the surname French, perhaps hinting at the formation of a familial relationship through the apprenticeship system.[CITATION-83] Over time, the locus of apprenticeship moved from Freetown to the parish villages. So too the work done by apprentices changed. In Freetown, most apprentices were tied to masters engaged in some form of trade; in the villages, most were farmers or artisans. But apprenticeship in the villages is far less thoroughly documented than in the colonial capital. Children not chosen within the yard were sent with their older cohorts to the villages, where many were subsequently apprenticed to established inhabitants. The village manager took on the Liberated African Department\u2019s role of vetting masters and completing the indenture documents. Yet within the Liberated African Registers, children are only recorded as having been sent to the village, with no mention of the masters who took them on.The 1831 census shows that by this time, the greatest number of apprentices lived in the villages rather than Freetown. The population of the Liberated African villages and Banana Islands was counted as 21,462, of whom 2,308 were apprentices. The census listed \u2018servants\u2019 (rather than apprentices) in 1,348 of the 7,288 households counted in the peninsula outside of Freetown. Of these, only 554 households claimed multiple apprentices.[CITATION-84] Overall, approximately one in five households housed an apprentice in 1831, and most apprentices worked in households where they were the only indentured labour. Another \u2018Census of the Population of Liberated Africans\u2019, compiled between 1832 and 1834, recorded that, from 1808 to 19 October 1833, 4,365 of 43,058 Liberated Africans settled in Sierra Leone were apprenticed following disembarkation, consisting primarily of 1,645 boys and 1,421 girls (see Appendix II).The top-down, legalistic aspects of apprenticeship are relatively easy to analyse. So too are the scale of apprenticeship within the colony and the demographic patterns of indenture. The experience of apprenticeship is more difficult to uncover: what did apprentices do? How were they treated? How did they respond to their situation and \u2018push back\u2019 against abuses? It is clear that apprenticeship was not a benign institution. The system, through a combination of design and neglect, allowed for unregulated coerced labour and sexual exploitation. The term \u2018apprenticeship\u2019 itself obscures a wide spectrum of treatment, tasks and social relationships. Apprentices fetched and chopped wood, cleared and cultivated land, pounded rice, carried water and swept floors, alongside a range of other gendered tasks.[CITATION-85] Merchants and traders had apprentice porters to carry their goods, and fishermen used apprentices as rowers to haul nets and row to fishing grounds. Nova Scotian washerwomen would have Liberated African girls carry and beat the laundry while they focused on the business side of their operations.Recaptive apprentices\u2019 experiences varied based on the wealth of the master and the tasks they were assigned, as well as the master\u2019s personal qualities. Other variables included whether recaptives entered the home of older recaptives (more common in later decades) or the houses of Nova Scotians, Maroons or Europeans. If an apprentice joined the household of a recaptive of similar ethnic origins and experience of enslavement, the placement brought with it a very different process of socialisation from apprenticeship to a colonial official or someone formerly enslaved in the Americas. Apprenticeships could be an avenue for material advancement that was unobtainable to recaptives obliged to fare on their own. Apprenticeships could also involve brutal work regimes little different from slavery.Christopher Fyfe is certainly correct that \u2018many [apprentices] remained drudges, virtually domestic slaves, to masters and mistresses who treated them harshly, even cruelly\u2019.[CITATION-86] But the lack of administrative oversight means we only get glimpses of such cruelty: most of these apprenticeships are opaque to us. Few recaptive apprentices left any written trace of their experiences; those that did often have quite well documented lives, though this in turn raises the issue of how representative their experiences were. In particular, the best-documented cases are the extremes: those of apprentices rising to fortune through the benefaction of a wealthy master, or reports of gross mistreatment and sadistic behaviour.The Vice-Admiralty court adjudicated incidences of cruelty that were brought to the attention of the government. Cases usually relied upon the capacity of apprentices to bring their plight to official attention, and their courage in doing so. Anita Rupprecht has shown how Liberated African apprentices in the British Caribbean were aware of the terms of their indentures and brought grievances regarding tenure and tutelage before colonial courts.[CITATION-87] Cases that reached Freetown\u2019s court often revealed a reality far from what abolitionists had envisioned. William, a young male apprentice of John Wade Miller of Freetown, complained to the Liberated African Department that \u2018for nearly two days he had not been allowed sustenance of any kind\u2019. When William then took pudding from the pantry to feed himself, his master \u2018not only flogged him on the back but rubbed the part lacerated with the whipping over with salt\u2019.[CITATION-88] On other occasions, his master \u2018misused the said William by dipping his head in a chamber pot and rubbing a sock covered with the humours of an ulcer which Mr. Miller had on his leg in the mouth of the apprentice\u2019. Both the assistant superintendent of the department and the attendant medical officer forwarded their evidence to the Vice-Admiralty court as proof of a breach of indenture due to \u2018excessive punishment\u2019. The court agreed and terminated the five-month-old apprenticeship. William was certainly not alone in bringing his complaint before the department and the Vice-Admiralty court. But apprentices could be impeded in bringing a claim before the court. One male apprentice was sentenced to a month in a house of correction for making a \u2018false representation\u2019 after the Liberated African Department decided they could not substantiate his complaint of neglect.[CITATION-89] Over time, apprenticeship aroused concerns over ill-treatment, and over masters without the economic means to support their apprentices. In 1829, Lieutenant Governor Henry John Ricketts expressed his concerns that indentures had been made \u2018without any regard to the character or means of the individuals to whom the care and instruction of such apprentices have been entrusted\u2019. The lack of any written indenture outlining the responsibilities of masters and mistresses meant that \u2018they have \u2026 been ignorant of the obligation \u2026 by which they were bound\u2019 and that many apprentices simply broke the arrangement, instead \u2018seeking a precarious subsistence among the people of their own nation, living in the country villages\u2019.[CITATION-90] Ricketts undertook the first general inspection of apprentices since 1819, and found that the \u2018great deficiency in number\u2019 of apprentices in Freetown confirmed his worst suspicions.In 1832, Governor Findlay suggested appointing a \u2018guardian for the Liberated African apprentices\u2019, stating that \u2018the duties which devolve on the officers of the [Liberated African] department are so laborious, as to prevent so much of their time being devoted to the apprentices as they would require\u2019.[CITATION-91] A year later he returned to his proposal for a superintendent for apprentices, cautioning that apprenticeship had become \u2018a branch of service of such magnitude as to require much greater attention than the services of the Ordinary Establishment of Offices of the Department [of Liberated Africans] can possibly devote to it\u2019.[CITATION-92] Secretary of State Goderich declined the proposal.1838 saw the most explicit regulations for overseeing apprenticeship. Local officials were perhaps cognizant of the end of apprenticeship in the British Caribbean and the international scrutiny that the apprenticeship system had faced. But Governor Richard Doherty also noted the local reality that no muster or inspection of apprentices had occurred since 1829.[CITATION-93] The new regulations, also prompted in part by two cases of assault against apprentices, called for \u2018the more exemplary and effectual punishment of masters assaulting their apprentices\u2019.[CITATION-94] Doherty enabled the Court of Quarter Sessions to oversee criminal proceedings against violent masters, whereas previously jurisdiction had fallen to the Vice-Admiralty court, where decisions could linger for months. Punishment for abusive masters was now to include hard labour, \u2018simple incarceration being a punishment too lightly considered\u2019.[CITATION-95] Despite these new measures, metropolitan and local officials continued to scrutinise Liberated African apprenticeship. Colonial reports in 1830, 1842 and 1855 paid close attention to apprenticeship. The Irish abolitionist Richard Robert Madden\u2014previously sent from England to Jamaica as one of the Special Magistrates to oversee the implementation of the 1833 Abolition Act\u2014arrived in West Africa as Commissioner of Enquiry in 1841. Madden reported that in Sierra Leone \u2018it is the poorest of the colored people who usually seek for apprentices\u2019 and that, instead of offering any form of instruction, the indentures \u2018enabled [them] to live on the labour of the apprentice\u2019.[CITATION-96] The most common reform debated was what the initial indenture fee should be set at. Ostensibly, this was to ensure that apprentices were only given out to masters who had the financial standing to clothe and feed a child, as well as some form of employment in which the child could be trained. The subtext of these discussions was that officials perceived poorer masters as more likely to neglect their apprentice and to be tempted to re-sell the child into slavery.[CITATION-97] Colonel Jones, the superintendent assistant of the Liberated African Department, lamented that \u2018the number of persons of moderate wealth & respectability is by no means adequate to the number of emancipated negroes to be indented\u2019. Jones surmised that this resulted in \u2018many of the poorer classes of the population becom[ing] possessed of apprentices who from the master\u2019s limited means of support are made to experience all the drudgeries of a menial in order to provide a subsistence to his family\u2019.[CITATION-98] Governors who shared these concerns responded by raising indenture fees. Lieutenant Governor Ricketts, for example, concluded in 1829 that \u2018ten shillings upon each indenture should continue to be charged as heretofore, for unless this sum, altho\u2019 small, was paid by the parties, they would in all probability show but little care or attention to the instruction of the apprentices\u2019.[CITATION-99] Lieutenant Governor Henry Dundas Campbell, concerned with the \u2018vice and prostitution\u2019 of female apprentices, raised the indenture fee from ten shillings to one pound \u2018in hope of excluding to a certain degree those who ought not to have apprentices\u2019.[CITATION-100] With lax oversight, the system increased the vulnerability of youth, particularly young women. Lieutenant Governor Dixon Denham recognised that \u2018the elder girls, instead of being married, and settled in the villages from the schools, have after a short time left their adopted parents, from ill treatment, or neglect, and are living in a state of prostitution, in Free Town\u2019.[CITATION-101] Hannah, a Liberated African apprentice who arrived in Sierra Leone around 1825, complained to the Liberated African Department that her master \u2018induced her to live with him in a state of prostitution\u2019. When the man fled the colony, his wife threatened to turn the girl away, leading Hannah to contact the department.[CITATION-102] Henry Dundas Campbell refused to give any female apprentices to households where there was not \u2018a female of good character\u2019.[CITATION-103] Yet the system remained unsatisfactory both to the colonial state and to a great number of apprentices. Lieutenant Governor Findlay lamented that the \u2018ungovernable disposition\u2019 of many apprentices, combined with the \u2018want of due care and attention\u2019 of their masters and mistresses, meant that \u2018scarcely a day passes but there occurs from twenty to thirty complaints before the assistant superintendent\u2019 of the Liberated African Department. Worse still, the department was ill-equipped to deal with the volume of complaints, \u2018the consequence [of] which is that the apprentice generally elopes and frequently falls into the hands of kidnappers who infest the Colony\u2019.[CITATION-104] The most glaring act of ill-treatment was the trafficking of apprentices to be re-enslaved outside of the colony. As Philip Misevich has shown, re-enslavement was a misfortune that many Liberated Africans faced and to which children were particularly susceptible.[CITATION-105] Easily moved, especially by canoe, young and often impressionable youths could be deceived by masters who wanted to cash in an asset quickly, or to relieve themselves of responsibility. The CMS missionary John Weeks stated in January 1831 that \u2018were an investigation into the number of liberated African apprentices in the villages to be instituted, it would be found that a great number of them had disappeared, and these, Deponent has no doubt, have principally been sold as slaves\u2019.[CITATION-106] F. Harrison Rankin, who visited Sierra Leone in 1834, concluded that he could not \u2018conceive a system better adapted to favour the slave-trade\u2019 than the apprenticeship system in the colony.[CITATION-107] The clandestine trade in apprentices revealed itself to colonial officials in a number of disquieting ways. One was that the Royal Navy began to find youths on board intercepted slavers with a knowledge of English and of the British colony. When the crew of HMSboarded the French slavernear the Rio Pongo in 1830, they found on board two boys\u2014John Davis and George\u2014who both claimed to be Liberated Africans or \u2018a King\u2019s Boy\u2019. John Davis later told the Chief Justice of Sierra Leone that he had lived in Sierra Leone for six years as an apprentice to a man named Tom Black in Freetown. Black told Davis to follow a Mandinka trader outside of the colony to buy rice. This was a subterfuge, and the trader led and sold the boy to John Ormond, one of the most active slave traders in the Rio Pongo region in the 1810s and 1820s.[CITATION-108] The treatment of apprentices meant that many Liberated African children sought their own liberation through flight. In June 1811, a Maroon settler named James Brown complained to the Governor and Council that his two apprentices had run away with other Liberated African apprentices to a town called Bompetuk to the south of the colony, adjacent to the Plantain Islands.[CITATION-109] Kenneth Macaulay wrote to George Stephen Caulker, the chief of the Plantain Islands, demanding that Caulker assist in the immediate return of the apprentices and invoking \u2018the unpleasant necessity of appealing to force\u2019.[CITATION-110] The government threatened fines and retribution for the harbouring of runaway apprentices, both inside and outside the colony. A Liberated African Department circular to the village managers in 1829 relayed the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s concerns that many apprentices had fled their households and were now \u2018wandering about, from village to village, without having lawful means of gaining a livelihood\u2019.[CITATION-111] The circular stipulated new measures: that those harbouring runaways could be fined up to 5 shillings, and that constables were to monitor carefully the movement of Liberated Africans between villages.Some masters sought out their fleeing domestics. Advertisements for runaway apprentices appeared in local newspapers and bear similarities to runaway slave notices in the Americas, as well as earlier advertisements in Britain for both runaway apprentices and enslaved domestics.[CITATION-112] In 1843, the, the official publication of the Wesleyan Methodists and the first non-government newspaper in the colony, ran the following advertisement, taken out by the Freetown-based attorney Richard Lawrence:Five Shilling reward: Absconded from the service of Richard Lawrence, on the 30th of October, John Comay, an indented apprentice, a Liberated African boy. All persons are hereby cautioned against trusting him; and any person found harbouring said apprentice, or employing him, will be proceeded against as the law directs. This above named reward will be paid by the subscriber, on the delivery of said apprentice.[CITATION-113] These advertisements represent one end of the spectrum in terms of apprentices\u2019 experiences. Along with cases of re-enslavement and cases of mistreatment brought before the Vice-Admiralty court, they show that for many individuals, masters and Liberated Africans alike, apprenticeship bore many analogies to slavery.Alongside cases of neglect and exploitation were many instances where apprenticeship resulted in the creation of familial relationships and a route to social advancement and prosperity in Freetown society. As Audra Diptee has observed, colonial officials in Africa often relied on quasi-parental and kinship structures of guardianship as cover for the appropriation of child labour.[CITATION-114] But this conscious distancing from slavery under the guise of guardianship did not preclude the formation of meaningful \u2018fictive\u2019 kinships. Apprenticeship could provide Liberated Africans with access to the capital necessary to buy a canoe or items at auction so that they could establish themselves as traders. John French, who reached Freetown in 1810, learnt carpentry from his Maroon master. After his indenture, he began making frame houses and employing others, eventually earning enough to purchase three lots in central Freetown and in 1818 construct a stone house (a key sign of economic success in the colony). Cato and Peter Preston served seven years\u2019 apprenticeship with a Nova Scotian widow as servants before being apprenticed to Peter Scott, a Nova Scotian butcher. When he died, they took over his business and within a few years had each made enough to build a stone house.[CITATION-115] Perhaps the best-documented case of a mutually beneficial apprenticeship is that of Thomas Will and his apprentice James Will. This is because the latter left an account of his enslavement, liberation and apprenticeship that is now contained in the archive of the Methodist Missionary Society. In October 1830, Thomas Will entered the Liberated African yard seeking an apprentice. Thomas, a Liberated African born in the Yoruba-speaking Oyo Empire, was by this time a successful trader located on Freetown\u2019s Pademba Road. For four years prior to this, he had profited from the re-sale of goods purchased at auction from captured slave ships.[CITATION-116] Such business acumen had earned Thomas Will the title of \u2018Aku King\u2019, a mark of respect that would pass to Freetown\u2019s most successful Yoruba traders over subsequent decades.[CITATION-117] Like other residents of Freetown, Thomas would have gone to the Liberated African yard himself to choose his apprentice; those in the villages had their apprentices sent to them. In the yard, Thomas spotted a young boy named Kealoo recently arrived on the slave ship. Officials in the Liberated African Department took Kealoo to be about nine years old.[CITATION-118] Thomas already had at least two apprentices. The first, a girl named Olefedick, arrived in the colony in 1827 on a slaver destined for Bahia from Lagos.[CITATION-119] The second, a boy named Achudoh, was rescued in 1829 from a voyage from Ouidah to Bahia.[CITATION-120] That all of Thomas\u2019s apprentices came from ports in the Bight of Benin would suggest that his taking of apprentices was largely in keeping with the custom that young recaptives be apprenticed \u2018to their country people\u2019, in this case those who probably spoke various dialects of the Yoruba language.Though the indenture was in Thomas Will\u2019s name, James mentions that his master at first \u2018gave me to one of his country men there live until this man died and I went back to Mr. Thomas Will\u2019. If this policy of lending out an apprentice was legally sanctioned it was not widespread, and is perhaps explained by Thomas\u2019s status as Aku King. James spent seven years as an apprentice to Thomas, the legal maximum for apprenticeships in this era. During these years, he worked in what he described as his master\u2019s \u2018hawkers shop\u2019, effectively running it from 1834.[CITATION-121] By the early 1840s, James Will had established himself as a successful shopkeeper and Wesleyan preacher. Later that decade, he was able to send funds to the fledgling Mendi Mission south of the colony.[CITATION-122] His financial success, built upon that of his former master, exemplified the upward mobility of a fortunate few Liberated Africans in Freetown society.Apprenticeship, though criticised and denounced at various points by governors and officials, was only ended in 1848. Ultimately, its abolition had little to do with the concerns over morality and mistreatment which had percolated for four decades. The Acting Governor Benjamin Pine wrote to the Secretary of State, Earl Grey\u2014who also opposed the apprenticeship system\u2014expressing his own \u2018personal conviction of its mischievous tendency\u2019.[CITATION-123] The official government notice issued in the colony declared that indenture had been \u2018found by experience liable to degenerate into a condition scarcely consistent with the advantages of that entire freedom\u2019.[CITATION-124] But the real impetus for abolition was, ironically, emancipation in the West Indies in 1838, and the ensuing labour demands of Britain\u2019s Caribbean islands.Following the abolition of slavery in the British Caribbean, planters petitioned to be allowed to recruit among Liberated Africans in Sierra Leone. Governor Pine favoured such proposals. He postulated that the termination of apprenticeship in Sierra Leone would spur voluntary emigration to the West Indies by removing \u2018inducements\u2019 to remain in the colony, namely the fact that apprenticeship meant that one\u2019s \u2018livelihood may be procured by the unpaid labor of others\u2019.[CITATION-125] The end of apprenticeship left the problem of \u2018disposing\u2019 of Liberated African children, but the acting governor was confident that those who refused to emigrate could simply be placed with missionaries in the colony. Ultimately, 15,230 Liberated Africans migrated from Sierra Leone to the West Indies between 1841 and 1863. Most were newly arrived Liberated Africans who were forcibly removed with little volition on their part. Few former apprentices took up recruitment appeals to migrate voluntarily to the Caribbean.[CITATION-126] With this supply of household servants abolished, colonial inhabitants in Sierra Leone turned to an equally ambiguous practice of employing children from outside the colony as \u2018wards\u2019. As Fyfe explained, \u2018it was an old established custom for children to be sent to the Colony from up country to be \u201craised\u201d, to live in a household and learn \u201cwhite man fashion\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-127] Even during the era of apprenticeship, appealing to the Liberated African Department was not the only means of acquiring young dependent labour. As early as 1808, Governor Thompson wrote disapprovingly in thethat \u2018there are many good men within the Colony who have native children in their houses and use them like their own; but there are others who know they bought them for dollars and rum and tobacco from the native chiefs, and who think they may use them as they please because\u2019.[CITATION-128] Thompson forbade further purchases, though he offered an indemnity to colonial inhabitants whom he felt had been ignorant of the Abolition Act.Scholars such as Christine Whyte have more fully analysed whether wardship was simply a form of exploitation or a system of mutual benefit.[CITATION-129] Yet it is clear that the practice of colonial residents acquiring unpaid juvenile labour did not end with the abolition of Liberated African apprenticeship in 1848. In 1853, Governor A.E. Kennedy referred to \u2018the now notorious system of buying, selling, and holding slaves in this colony\u2019. In response to the \u2018disgraceful traffic in children\u2019, he passed ordinances mandating the registration of children from outside the colony and changes to the judicial system. From the mid-1850s, Freetown officials started keeping an \u2018Alien Children Register\u2019. Freetown\u2019s merchants protested against the measures, with 195 of the city\u2019s inhabitants signing a petition against the curtailment of their ability to procure wards. Many Freetownians saw themselves as continuing the very concept of apprenticeship that British abolitionists had conceived. Kennedy, much like Thompson half a century earlier, railed against what he saw as a thinly veiled trade in enslaved children. The unremunerated labour of youth remained a reality of Freetown life throughout the colonial period.Apprenticeship was one of the most common forms of \u2018disposal\u2019 for Liberated Africans in Freetown and around the Atlantic world. On Tortola, as in Sierra Leone, the first Africans \u2018condemned\u2019 by the island\u2019s Vice-Admiralty court in 1808 were apprenticed in accordance with the narrow parameters of the 1807 Abolition Act. Here, apprentices were indentured to naval ships as well as to the Trinidad estate of Sir Alexander Cochrane, a rear admiral of the Royal Navy.[CITATION-130] Elite colonials on Tortola employed large numbers of the apprentices in their households or hired them out. An 1821 Royal Commission to investigate the \u2018state\u2019 and \u2018condition\u2019 of apprentices on Tortola found that many had fled by boat to the nearby Danish island and free port of Saint Thomas.[CITATION-131] At the Cape Colony, the indenture of Liberated Africans (locally referred to as \u2018Prize Negroes\u2019) from 1808 to the 1840s provided colonists and officials with a valuable source of unskilled labour after the 1807 Abolition Act forbade the importation of slaves.[CITATION-132] From 1818 onwards, approximately 3,478 Liberated Africans were forcibly transported from Freetown to the nascent British settlements along the Gambia River, where many were apprenticed to local merchant-settlers at Bathurst. Here, some of the wealthiest merchants acquired unpaid labour forces of fifty to ninety recaptives.[CITATION-133] On St Helena, apprenticeship provided a short-lived solution to the influx of Liberated Africans following the establishment of a Vice-Admiralty court on the small island in 1840. Though only in operation for a few years, the laxity of the system resulted in what the surgeon to the Liberated African depot referred to as a \u2018mania of Negro-keeping\u2019.[CITATION-134] On Mauritius, Liberated Africans were allocated as apprentices to local planters or referred for an initial period to the Powder Mills Orphan Asylum. Their arrival on slave ships intercepted near the Mozambique Channel was consciously designed to fill the labour gap that followed colonial emancipation.[CITATION-135] Liberated Africans who were landed at Havana and Rio de Janeiro faced an even more circumscribed freedom. They were bound to seven-year apprenticeships within these urban epicentres of New World slavery, and many had their terms of apprenticeship unlawfully extended by years and even decades.[CITATION-136] Sierra Leone has recently resumed its place in the history of British anti-slavery, as historians have examined the role of the colony in the burgeoning abolitionist movement of late eighteenth-century Britain.[CITATION-137] Sierra Leone was a testing ground in Britain\u2019s \u2018mighty experiment\u2019 of envisioning an empire without slavery, and apprenticeship formed a key component in these formulations. Apprenticeship was a system of unpaid labour that benefited Freetown\u2019s aspirational traders, and one whose lax oversight left considerable room for exploitation and harsh treatment. Some apprentices sought redress against exploitation by masters and mistresses through the courts and an emerging colonial bureaucracy. Far more \u2018pushed back\u2019 against an exploitative system by simply running away. For others, indenture was a means of social advancement, the first step for some of the most prominent and wealthy residents of nineteenth-century Freetown. The paternalism of abolitionists made apprenticeship seem desirable; the youthful age of many of the victims of the nineteenth-century slave trade made it seem advisable. Apprenticeship was a practical solution to the problem of child recaptives, but also a metaphor that captured both the aspirations and paternalism inherent in \u2018liberating\u2019 Africans.: TNA, CO 267/127, \u2018Census of Population and Liberated Africans\u2019, pp. 72\u201386.: TNA, CO 267/127, \u2018Census of Population and Liberated Africans\u2019, pp. 72\u201386."

    "text": "The significance of the wreck of theon 6 May 1682to Scotland, with James Stuart, duke of York, later James II and VII, on board, is poorly understood. Based on new archival research, this article places the event in its political, cultural and naval contexts in order to re-evaluate its importance to British history and to correct a number of inaccuracies in recent historiography. The wreck occurred at a sensitive political moment when, within the maelstrom of the Exclusion Crisis (1679\u201381), the Duke was hopeful of securing his place in the succession. However, thanks in part to the cultural vigour of the \u2018ship of state\u2019 trope, the disaster risked James being regarded as a pilot and commander unable to steer the nation. Because his political enemies could use the shipwreck as propaganda to undermine his position as heir to the throne, the event in general, and especially the Duke\u2019s behaviour, became popular topics which were debated and contested from Whig and Tory viewpoints. Since the tragedy occurred at sea, one arm of early modern state apparatus that was especially responsive to these debates was the English navy, which was itself in the midst of a power struggle between Crown and admiralty for control over its future direction. The article sheds new light on the far-reaching implications for James\u2019s reign of the sinking of the, and argues afresh for the centrality of maritime history to Restoration political history.On 6 May 1682, James Stuart, duke of York and later James II and VII, travelling on the third-rate frigate, was shipwrecked off the coast of Norfolk whileto Scotland. The ship struck sandbanks a few hours after a protracted argument between the Duke, the pilot and several naval officers over the course that was to be taken. James abandoned ship shortly before thesank, transferring to an accompanying vessel to complete his voyage, but hundreds of passengers and crew died. These tragic events and their causes have been the focus of some attention, but are incorrectly understood in current historiography.Most recently, poor transcription of a number of key documents in Nigel Pickford\u2019s 2021 studyhas led to spurious conclusions about what happened and why.As a result, the tragedy itself and its role in forming and reforming political allegiances is under-appreciated. In fact, the wreck\u2019s importance for early modern British political history is particularly acute because it occurred at a sensitive moment: the Duke, now optimistic about his place in the succession as the immediate threat of the Exclusion Crisis subsided, was going to Edinburgh to settle his affairs as Lord High Commissioner for Scotland and return with his family to reside at Charles II\u2019s court.In what follows, I argue that partisan political considerations as much as the actual events of the tragedy determined the impact of the\u2019s wreck in Restoration Britain. There were numerous eyewitnesses to the tragedy, since thewas heading a squadron of five other ships and four yachts. Political expediency and factional interests shaped how blame for the wreck was apportioned in the weeks, months and years afterwards, as the event became key to the political fortunes and perceptions of the Duke, the most illustrious of the\u2019s passengers. Since the reputation of the heir to the throne was involved, the political stakes of managing how the wreck was reported and remembered were high and of wide concern. Was James merely \u2018ane unfortunate Prince, who hath very bad luck at sea\u2019, as a contemporary commentator put it, or were the events of the wreck of profounder significance?One branch of the early modern state apparatus that was particularly sensitive to the wreck\u2019s meanings and implications was the Restoration navy. This was not merely because the tragedy occurred at sea but because, at that time, the navy itself was subject to an intense power struggle between competing interest groups over its control and future direction. This conflict is revealed to be central to the ways in which the after-effects of thetragedy were handled, with important policy implications.This article first discusses the significance of the \u2018ship of state\u2019 trope for understanding why the wreck was such a high-profile political event, before providing an account of the disaster itself and why it happened. It then explores the rich diversity of contemporary reactions to the wreck, as Whigs and Tories used it as a political battleground to continue the bitter factionalism of the Exclusion Crisis. A further section analyses the courts martial that officially determined who was to blame for the tragedy. Here discussion focuses on the wreck\u2019s significance for the larger history of the Restoration navy, where Crown and admiralty each sought control over policy. This thus provides a final, key area of discussion for understanding the legacies of James\u2019s shipwreck in 1682 and why it mattered.Thanks in part to the well-established allegorical device of the \u2018ship of state\u2019, the threat to the political nation posed by a monarch (or heir to the throne) drowning through shipwreck attracted wide-ranging commentary.The role of the pilot/monarch in guiding the ship of state was a popular trope, which took on renewed significance in the early modern period since, in an age of European expansionism, nations competed for colonial territory and imperial power through textual and actual maritime activities. In the 1660s and 1670s, for instance, maritime symbolism\u2014such as respect for the English national flag, or Dutch ships striking sails in acknowledgement of English maritime sovereignty\u2014was a notable aspect of Anglo-Dutch diplomacy that was aggressively negotiated within treaties or cited as a justification for war.Just as significant as these expansionist proclamations of monarchical maritime authority were images that expressed more political uncertainty about the value of maritime activities. The captainless, rudderless boat was an enduringly popular early modern topos, used in various ways\u2014including the boat set adrift, voluntary exile or pilgrimage by sea, and transport by a self-propelled magical vessel\u2014to represent allegorically the problems of governance.The most famous early modern depiction of an out-of-control ship is the one that opens William Shakespeare\u2019s(1611), where the mariners vainly attempt to master a distressed, listing craft while the courtiers \u2018assist the storm\u2019 through their interference.In fact, two ungovernable ships are described in the opening scenes, since, when Miranda appears passionately concerned with the suffering of those shipwrecked, her father reminds her of their own encounter with an unmanageable vessel when they were cast adrift from Milan in a \u2018rotten carcase of a butt, not rigged, / Nor tackle, sail, nor mast\u2019.The repetition invites audiences to contemplate the failures of command. On one level, the play is a dramatic meditation on the absence of political mastery over land and sea: it eliminates heroic prowess from the action and ships\u2019 occupants become victims rather than agents. This depiction was still relevant when thefoundered in 1682. The much-staged Restoration version of(1667) by John Dryden and William Davenant, with songs added by Thomas Shadwell (1675), was performed in the spring of 1682 by the Duke\u2019s Company and, on separate occasions, before the Russian and Moroccan ambassadors.Restoration productions maintained the cultural meanings of shipwreck in the imaginary of elite and common spectators alike, especially its connection to the failures of leadership.These maritime tropes had widespread appeal in seventeenth-century Britain, reflecting national ambitions led by the Stuart monarchs to establish a global empire built through seaborne activity via a series of expansionist naval and foreign policies.Maritime metaphors are prominent, for instance, in John Nalson\u2019s royalist history of the English Civil War,, published contemporaneously with theshipwreck in two volumes (1682\u20133), which explicitly aimed to alert readers to the dangerous activities of \u2018Factious Mariners, who pretend to save the Vessel by throwing the Captain and Pilots over-board\u2019.The frontispiece to the second volume, by Robert White, depicts the ship of state in distress during a \u2018Tempest\u2019, as brawling Parliamentarians on land jostle to see their king cast overboard, while the sky overhead turns black and a thunderbolt from heaven is shown striking St Stephen\u2019s, Westminster Palace (seeand).John Nalson,(2 vols, London, 1682\u201383; Folger Shakespeare Library, N106), ii, frontispiece by Robert White. Reproduced with permission of the Folger Shakespeare Library.Detail of Figure 1, showing the political overthrow of Charles I as he is cast overboard from the political nation. Reproduced with permission of the Folger Shakespeare Library.This image demands our engagement: who exactly is responsible for the failures of government it depicts? Who is to blame for the listing ship of state that appears to be about to capsize in choppy waters? Is it the captain, sea, crew, onlookers, all of them, or some combination? The accompanying \u2018Meaning of the Frontispiece\u2019 makes clear only who isaccountable: the abused and betrayed king. Describing him as \u2018God\u2019s lieutenant\u2019 on earth, the poem explains the chaos that results from subjects forcibly ejecting their divinely chosen captain from the ship\u2014the notorious and expensive(renamedin 1660 by Charles II),which the king metonymically represents:When th\u2019weather-beaten layOn the proud billows of the popular Sea;Her rudder lost, her Main-Mast beaten downHer Tackling torn, and Mariners desperate grown;Thefrom his Cabin driv\u2019n awayIn that for ever execrable Day \u2026By Storms and stress of Weather was He tostUponNative, dis-ingenious Coast \u2026They paid no reverence to their natural Lord \u2026But laugh\u2019t to seehoisted overboard.God\u2019s goods they called the dismal Wreck they saw,And vouch\u2019t their Pyracy by an Heav\u2019nly law.Without a king, the ship of state becomes a \u2018dismal Wreck\u2019, illegitimately seized by a crew turned pirates, who\u2014described as \u2018monsters\u2019\u2014ignore and usurp the laws of God and his earthly representative, the king, to bring \u2018scorn\u2019 and destruction. The \u2018popular\u2019 sea (i.e., the people), the irreverent crew who \u2018laugh\u2019 as they throw the king overboard, and their compatriots the rebellious onlookers, are held jointly responsible for the wanton destruction of their rightful leader and their country. The fact that this specific storm-tossed ship had been commissioned by Charles and named in his own image underlines the doubly violent political rebellion, against monarch and state, that the text and image depict.As a royalist Tory clergyman writing under the patronage of Charles II, Nalson composed his history with a present purpose: to please a king who sought to control the opposition-dominated parliaments of Habeas Corpus, the Exclusion Bill, and Oxford between 1679 and 1681.The central image of the captainless and pilotless ship overrun by mariners-turned-pirates may represent the \u2018fatal example\u2019 of the English Civil War, but it also warns the country against another impending \u2018maritime\u2019 calamity: \u2018[G]enerous English may learn that necessary caution to be wise at the expense of their unhappy progenitors; and being enabled so easily to discover the cheat of those \u2026 they may prevent and avoid a second shipwreck\u2019.Nalson\u2019s \u2018second shipwreck\u2019 refers to the oppositional, Whig-led political Exclusion Crisis, which sought to debar James as heir presumptive from the throne on the grounds of his Catholicism. Yet it seems not improbable that the high-profile shipwreck James suffered on thein 1682, and his narrow escape from death through drowning\u2014an incident of potentially devastating political consequences for the Tories\u2014may also have inspired Nalson\u2019s fear of a \u2018second shipwreck\u2019.As a former Lord High Admiral of England and active in that role, as well as maintaining a keen interest in naval affairs subsequently, the Duke had fashioned his identity as a maritime commander.shows James opulently dressed as Mars, God of War, with the English fleet behind him, displaying prominently his flagshipat anchor, probably an allusion to his role as commander at the Battle of Solebay in 1672 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War.James, Duke of York, 1633\u20131701, by Henri Gascar, 1672/3. Reproduced with permission of the National Maritime Museum.The Duke\u2019s prominence in English naval affairs also inspired less celebratory depictions than Henri Gascar\u2019s bravura portrait. The disastrous Second Anglo-Dutch War had been provoked in 1665 by James\u2019s ambitious belief that England could defeat the Dutch in a naval war in the Channel and North Sea, which would be self-financing through the regular seizure of Dutch East Indiamen laden with goods from Asia and silver bullion for Spain.In fact, Charles II was forced to conclude peace hastily in July 1667 after the Dutch raid on the Medway in June that year when, humiliatingly, the navy was unable to prevent two English warships from being captured, towed and sailed in triumph as prizes across the North Sea to the United Provinces. It was, as John Evelyn wrote, \u2018A dreadful spectacle as ever Englishmen saw and a dishonour never to be wiped off!\u2019The production of Davenant and Dryden\u2019s, which opened on 7 November 1667, took commercial advantage of the upsurge in popular interest in material that connected maritime activities to failures of leadership. In an echo of the waning of the Stuart brothers\u2019 prestige after the Medway raid, the shipwrecked Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan, is a much-diminished figure in his Restoration incarnation, without judgement or authority.In the play the Duke\u2019s personal powers, as well as the threats against him, are reduced: his usurpers, Alonzo and Antonio, have repented prior to their shipwreck on the island and there is no plot against Prospero\u2019s life by Caliban and his cronies. All Prospero is able to achieve at the end of the play is to recover the \u2018illusion of control or agency\u2019.It is Ariel who determines the outcome of events, not the Duke: Ariel narrowly averts tragedy when Prospero unjustly condemns Ferdinand for murder by miraculously reviving the victim, while Prospero\u2019s eagerness to condemn Ferdinand borders on bloodthirstiness: \u2018No pleasure now is left me but Revenge\u2019.The connection to the Duke of York is plain. As Chief Officer of the Navy, James was ultimately responsible for the acute national embarrassment of the Medway raid, but he blamed his subordinates. The Naval Commissioner Peter Pett was threatened with impeachment\u2014even his execution was briefly discussed (the Earl of Arlington sardonically suggested that \u2018If he [Pett] deserved hanging \u2026 and have it, much of the staine will be wip\u2019d off of the Government\u2019)\u2014to conceal the failures of his master.Indeed, in a manner characteristic of his leadership, James had hesitated to take decisive action when the Dutch attacked and had also declined to oversee and monitor defensive preparations effectively, thereby enabling the Dutch to complete the raid unopposed. These traits\u2014indecisiveness under pressure and the scapegoating of subordinates\u2014are also evident in the events of thewreck and its aftermath.Before turning to explore how thewreck became a metonym for the leadership abilities of the heir to the throne, used in larger contemporary debates concerning naval policy as well as to sustain and structure political opposition between Whigs and Tories in the 1680s, the events of the voyage require summarising.The following discussion offers a fresh evaluation of the surviving documents and witness accounts, and of a number of previously unexamined archival sources.Though Charles II had recalled James from exile in Scotland earlier in 1682 because the Whig party\u2019s long campaign, led by the Earl of Shaftesbury, to debar the Duke of York from the succession was waning, James had initially returned to court at Newmarket and then in London without his own family. Charles had originally sent his brother to Scotland in 1679 to reconcile factional arguments there concerning the toleration of religious dissent and to keep the peace, making him Lord High Commissioner of Scotland in 1681.The intention had also been to keep him out of London in the wake of the fictitious \u2018Popish Plot\u2019, an alleged conspiracy to kill the king and replace him with James, and the popular anti-Catholic hostility it had provoked. During the spring of 1682, more confident of his place in the succession, James was emboldened to become visible in London and at court in Windsor.He attended a performance by the Duke\u2019s Company of Thomas Otway\u2019s new tragedyon 21 April, with a specially written Prologue by John Dryden and an Epilogue by Otway spoken to honour his return. The play was advertised ina week later on 27 April with the endorsement \u2018Recommended to All Men of Sense and Loyalty\u2019, publicly presenting the Duke as central to the nation\u2019s political future.In May 1682, James was travelling back to Scotland to complete royal business in Edinburgh and to bring his pregnant wife, Mary of Modena, and his daughter Anne to reside at Charles II\u2019s court. It was politically advantageous for Mary\u2019s baby to be born in England; the royal family hoped that the child would be a prince to further secure the Stuart dynasty. With Charles visibly ageing, and having already suffered a stroke by 1682, power was slowly gravitating to James and a number of prominent English, Irish and Scottish courtiers accompanied him on the voyage.James and his retinue had convened at Margate Road on 3 May for the voyage north, seen off by the king and a large entourage, with the transfer of baggage and passengers from barges to the royal yachts and frigates taking several hours to complete.The fleet departed the next morning. Though no muster list for the passage on thesurvives, and both eyewitness and other contemporary accounts are sometimes confused concerning the names of those on board, notable passengers included James\u2019s closest advisors, Colonel George Legge (the Master of Ordnance) and Captain John Churchill, and leading Scottish nobles, politicians and merchants, such as Sir James Dick, Lord Provost of Edinburgh; George Seton, earl of Winton; Alexander Seton, Lord Pitmedden; Sir David Falconer of Newton; James Drummond, earl of Perth; Charles Middleton, earl of Middleton; and Sir George Gordon, Lord Haddo.From survivors\u2019 accounts, it is apparent that the wreck of theoff the North Norfolk coast in the early morning of 6 May was harrowing. Sir John Berry, commander of the, wrote a detailed narrative of events soon afterwards, as did the Duke of York\u2019s guest the Scottish merchant Dick, and the Duke himself; Churchill\u2019s and Legge\u2019s experiences were recorded later by relatives.There were also hundreds of witnesses to the disaster on the accompanying vessels in the fleet, the,,,and, and the royal yachts the,,and. Samuel Pepys, who witnessed the disaster from the, wrote on 8 May a letter describing events as far as he knew them, realising that the wreck would \u2018soon become the talk of the town\u2019.Christopher Gunman, captain of the, which conveyed James to Scotland following the wreck, also recounted events in his journal and elsewhere.The tragedy was so brutal because thesank quickly after striking part of the Leman and Ower parallel sandbanks, at approximately 5.30 a.m. Hoping that the warship could be saved, the Duke had hesitated to abandon ship, only leaving the vessel on the ship\u2019s boat with a small number of companions shortly before it fully submerged less than an hour after it had first hit the sandbank.Others aboard the ship were not so fortunate, since protocol dictated that they could not evacuate before royalty. It also took time to load onto the boat the Duke\u2019s strongbox, believed to have contained his memoirs and other political documents, and, fearing it would be overturned in the choppy seas, his supporters had made sure the boat was underfilled. There was only time to scramble one further boat from the, and this was swiftly overrun by passengers and crew.While estimates of the number of people who died vary widely between accounts, they suggest that between 130 and 250 of the approximately 330 passengers and crew onboard thedrowned.This included a number of high-profile nobles including Robert Ker, earl of Roxburghe; Donogh O\u2019Brian, Lord Ibracken; John Hope, laird of Hoptoun; and Sir Joseph Douglas. James\u2019s own family was closely affected: James Hyde (b..1650), second lieutenant on the, drowned. Hyde was the youngest brother of James\u2019s first wife Anne Hyde (d. 1671), and of his political allies Henry Hyde, earl of Clarendon, and Laurence Hyde, First Lord of the Treasury. The Duke\u2019s private loss was particularly acute since members of his household staff also died, including his equerry \u2018Lord Hollis\u2019., published almost immediately afterwards, related that \u2018all the Dukes Cooks but one, all his Footmen, and all the rest of his Servants\u2019 drowned.The ship\u2019s elite passengers may not have been exclusively male:, clearly based on eyewitness testimonials, reports the death of \u2018anLady, whose name we cannot as yet learn\u2019.The identity of this noblewoman remains unknown: whether she was a wife, daughter or sister to those onboard, or perhaps a mistress, is likewise undetermined; but the inclusion of such a gossipy snippet was perhaps intended to draw attention to the pleasure-seeking intentions of James and his circle, and to the Duke\u2019s reputation as a libertine.presents the fullest possible extent of the tragedy, reporting that only sixty people survived, approximately a fifth of the estimated total figure of 330 passengers and crew aboard. A second letter, dated a few days later and published with a reprint of the earlier one, confirmed that 240 people remained missing, adding details about the financial scale of the tragedy: \u2018Tis judged that in Money, and other valuable things, which all perished in the sea will amount to above 30000l.\u2019.Theas a vessel also represented a considerable asset: the ship had been comprehensively and expensively refitted in 1678\u201380 and had been awaiting deployment as part of a fleet of six ships being sent to the coast of Ireland and from there to Tangier under Berry\u2019s command when he received new orders to transport the Duke and his party.Who was to blame for the\u2019s loss? Though James arrived safely in London on 27 May 1682 on the, determining responsibility for the wreck was a pressing concern. A disaster of this magnitude involving the heir to the throne while the succession remained a controversial and divisive national topic was inevitably highly charged, as well as being of personal importance to both the survivors and the families of the deceased. It was widely and quickly reported that on the evening before the wreck there had been a protracted and heated discussion between the Scottish pilot James Ayres (or Aire),the Duke, the\u2019s senior officers (including Captain Berry and Master Benjamin Holmes), Captain Gunman from the, Captain Ralph Sanderson of theand others, concerning the best route to enable the fleet to clear the North Norfolk sandbanks.Berry wrote:Captain Gunman and captain Saunders answered, we could not weather the sands, but must stand off; upon which the pilot, whose name is Captain Ayres, a person esteemed to be one of the best and ablest men to the northward, said we could weather the New-wark and all other sands, and was much dissatisfied that they should mistrust his judgement. His royal highness said it would be a secure way to tack, and stand off till ten or twelve o\u2019clock at night, and then we should have room enough to weather all the sands; upon which the pilot (though confident of his skill) agreed, and we tacked and stood away S.E., a windward tide under us. At half an hour past nine o\u2019clock, the pilot being urgent, desired to tack again. His royal highness was still of opinion to stand off longer, and asked his opinion, the pilot answered and said, he would engage his life, that if we tacked presently, we should, without hazard, weather all the sands. Notwithstanding all his arguments, (too long to enumerate), his Royal highness commanded the pilot to stand a glass longer for more security. At ten o\u2019clock we tacked and stood close hauled N. by E. and N.N. E., which course weathered the New-wark, the wind very strong at east, we continued our course.Saturday, 6\u2014All last night we steered N.N.E. till two o\u2019clock this morning, the wind at E., then we steered N. and at four o\u2019clock N.N.W. the pilot, presuming and confident, affirmed that this course would carry the ship out of all danger, and that we were past the Lemon and Oare; but to our great misfortune it proved otherwise.Berry\u2019s account shows the fierce and protracted nature of the argument over the ship\u2019s course, and its significance. Ayres, as a pilot with experience of the coastal route and knowledge of its navigational markers, advocated sailing between the coast and the sandbanks, the so-called \u2018Colliers Road\u2019 favoured by coasting vessels; Holmes, a skilled mariner but without local knowledge, supported a deep-sea route beyond the sandbanks, which was the standard course taken by big ships heading north; the Duke, as a former Lord High Admiral of England and serving High Admiral of Scotland and Ireland,an experienced naval commander in these coastal waters and the highest-ranking individual onboard, argued for a middle path between the coastal and deep-sea routes, which was eventually agreed. Gregory Robinson writes: \u2018clearly on the evening of the 5th off Lowestoft the navigation of the ship had been taken out of the pilot\u2019s hands by the Duke on the advice of the Captains Gunman and Sanderson\u2019.Indeed, he singles out James as the individual responsible for the tragedy: \u2018We may assume it was the Master who wished to stand southeast till midnight and so keep outside all the sands, and we know it was the pilot who at eight o\u2019clock wished not to tack at all, but hold his course northerly, through the way he knew. It was the Duke himself who decided at 10 o\u2019clock to take the middle course leading to destruction\u2019.However, Berry\u2019s account categorically records that Ayres as pilot confirmed that the Duke\u2019s route was safe: \u2018the pilot, presuming and confident, affirmed that this course would carry the ship out of all danger\u2019.The disaster in general and the Duke\u2019s role in causing it in particular had the potential to damage his reputation politically, especially in the light of the Exclusion Crisis. There was a risk that James\u2019s political enemies might seek to use the shipwreck as propaganda to threaten again his position as heir to the throne, by depicting him as a pilot unable to steer the nation\u2019s future and his own. For his supporters, it was therefore essential that others were quickly blamed: \u2018This was occasioned by the wrong calculation and ignorance of a pilot\u2019, wrote Dick emphatically on 9 May in a letter to the London merchant Patrick Elies.In the wreck\u2019s immediate aftermath, some survivors and witnesses, including Pepys, were in favour of Ayres\u2019s speedy execution, \u2018for the nearer satisfaction of those great families of this kingdom, who, it is feared, would be found the greatest sufferers in this calamity\u2019.The Duke, writing to William of Orange as soon as he arrived in Scotland, accepted no responsibility whatsoever, solely blaming the pilot for \u2018too great presumption\u2019 and \u2018mistaking both his course and distance\u2019. James vengefully commented that \u2018he [Ayres] was saved among the rest, by one of the yachts-boats, which had I then known, I had caused him to have been hanged immediately, according to the custom of the sea, but now he must receive his doom by a court martial, so soon as I shall arrive in England\u2019.James clearly expected him to be executed. The official government paper, the, confirmed in its edition of 11\u201315 May that Ayres had said \u2018He would engage his life, that, if we tackt presently, we should without hazard weather all the Sands\u2019, admitting his responsibility and tacitly acknowledging the potential consequences for him of getting the ship\u2019s course so tragically wrong.The, a Whig paper published by Richard Janeway, was more cautious in apportioning blame in its edition of 12\u201316 May, simply reporting that Ayres was detained (the \u2018Pilot is Committed, in order for his Trial for this Mis-Conduct\u2019), rather than directly blaming him for the wreck.An awareness of the political sensitivities of the situation for the Duke is apparent in the detailed reportage of the wreck\u2019s cause in theof 16 May, a Tory paper produced by Nathaniel Thompson: \u2018But His Royal Highnes \u2026 told Mr. Ayres the Pilot it would be a secure way to tack, and stand off till 12 at night, and then they should have room enough to weather the Sands; which the Pilot was loth to agree to: However at 4 on Saturday morning they steered N. N. W. the Pilot affirming the[y] were past the Lemon Oar; which proved an unfortunate mistake\u2019.Central to the accounts produced by the Tory press is that the pilot is explicitly shown to have agreed to the Duke\u2019s course; noticeable too is the relative mildness of the description in theof Ayres\u2019s accountability\u2014\u2018an unfortunate mistake\u2019 does not contain either the veiled or explicit threat to his life of other accounts, presumably because it highlights the Duke\u2019s own role in determining the route. It was also reported from Edinburgh that the pilot sought to explain the wreck as the result of natural marine processes rather than accepting that the\u2019s foundering was his fault: he \u2018says for himself, that the late great Storms had removed the Sands far distant from the place in which they were before, which thing sometimes happens\u2019.As Evans H. Muir has argued, using a longitudinal study, the North Norfolk sandbars off Yarmouth and Lowestoft and the channels between them are particularly dynamic and hence marine charts quickly become outdated, as a pilot such as Ayres, practised in navigating the channels and gats, knew from experience.Ayres\u2019s claims of shifting sands may well have been right.The accuracy of Pepys\u2019s prediction that the wreck would be \u2018the talk of the town\u2019 is reflected by the number of poems and ballads about it that were swiftly published, with some claiming that their publication was by popular demand: \u2018the Author of these few songs, being much sollicited for Copies, and not able to oblige all his Friends, was prevail\u2019d upon \u2026 to allow them to be Printed\u2019.The Tory poet and satirist Matthew Taubman\u2019s laudatory(1682) saw the shipwreck as punishment for a nation that had sinned: the Exclusion Crisis did \u2018raise the Storm\u2019, meaning that James \u2018must the Jonas be / That must appease the raging of the Sea\u2019.Just as God protected Jonah, Taubman writes, James is saved \u2018from Devouring Deeps\u2019 and this divine act \u2018Did in your [i.e., James\u2019s] life, our lives and hopes restore\u2019.Indeed, as later poems in the collection make clear, James\u2019s return from Scotland is a cause for celebration since it means \u2018the true Heir is come home again\u2019 to be welcomed by \u2018all honest Men\u2019.Taubman\u2019s poems reveal a close attention to accounts of events on the, counselling the \u2018Pilot take care, and look to your Charge\u2019 and then, after the ship runs aground, suggesting that those who drowned have made an honourable sacrifice to save the rightful heir: \u2018if we must fall while he safely does pass / Wee\u2019l in the full Tide of Allegiance be drown\u2019d\u2019.Patriotic celebrations were not confined to print: in 1682 a commemorative \u2018heroic\u2019 medal was issued to mark the Duke\u2019s escape, made by the goldsmith and medallist George Bowers, bearing the legends \u2018IACOBUS. DUX. EBORACENSIS. ET. ALBANENSIS.\u2019 (obverse) and \u2018IMPAVIDUM. FERIUNT.\u2019 (reverse) (seeand).The reverse image and legend, which translates as \u2018they strike him undismayed\u2019, emphasises the duke\u2019s fortitude in the face of adversity as \u2018they\u2019\u2014the rocks\u2014strike the ship.The image rescripts the events of the wreck\u2014the presence of land to leeward and the small rescue boat apparently rowing out to thefrom the shore changes the tenor of the shipwreck considerably, since land had not been nearby but some 25 miles distant, and the Duke had transferred to another vessel (the) for the remaining voyage. The presence of land is a visual sign designed to suggest that the victims of the shipwreck will be rescued, thus reducing the depth of the tragedy, just as the Duke\u2019s bravery (he remains \u2018undismayed\u2019) is intended to provoke admiration.Silver medal, by George Bower, 1682: Bust of James, Duke of York, right, hair long, in mantle round the shoulders (obverse).

Those who previously had opposed James\u2019s position\u2014\u2018a stiff-neck\u2019d-harden\u2019d Crew\u2019\u2014are given a last chance to join \u2018the better half\u2019 as they \u2018at last their Errour see\u2019.As would be expected in the late spring of 1682, with the ascendancy of the Tories in the Exclusion Crisis, the majority of surviving cultural reactions to James\u2019s experiences and behaviour on thewere laudatory. Whig responses were noticeably, though mutedly, critical. For instance, ballad-makers from both sides of the political divide developed a competitive, intertextual rivalry about the respective merits and right to the throne of the rival heirs: \u2018Old Jemmy\u2019 or \u2018Royal Jemmy\u2019, referring to the Duke of York, and \u2018Young Jemmy\u2019, the Duke of Monmouth. In(1682), the Tory balladeer celebrates \u2018Royal Jemmy\u2019s\u2019 return \u2018Whom Heaven Protected o\u2019r the Seas\u2019. A Whig response published later that year,, celebrated \u2018young Jemmy\u2019s\u2019 triumph in his northern progress to Cheshire in the autumn of 1682.It was no coincidence that the Whig ballad was sung to the tune of, that the title mentioned Monmouth\u2019s \u2018happy return\u2019, the name of the vessel on which York returned to London in May 1682, or that the ballad explicitly stated: \u2018We \u2026 scorn the Popish line\u2019. This appropriation made apparent the rivalry between the two heirs, even as the Whig ballad emphasised York\u2019s dangerous and un-English Catholicism: \u2018no Duke, no Pope, nor Divel\u2019.Just as supporters of Monmouth started wearing a blue ribbon out of doors, which led to York\u2019s followers sporting a red one, ballads from each side of the political divide intertextually used and recycled identical images to support the claims of their respective royal \u2018Jemmy\u2019 to be Charles\u2019s heir and to disparage the abilities of their rival.In these debates, the ability to steer the ship of state was a key determinant of a monarch\u2019s or royal heir\u2019s qualities. For the Whigs, Monmouth was now undoubtedly the better pilot: \u2018None but wise men can sail, with a contrary gale / And successfully strive with the torrent. / This Jemmy could do\u2019.For the Tories, after the wreck of the, the terms in which they described York shifted; his miraculous survival could now be lauded as prophetic, marking his succession as inevitable: \u2018From the Salt Waves set free\u2019, as his supporters \u2018Rejoyces, our Noise / shall Defend the Raging o\u2019th Sea\u2019\u2014though no comments are made about his pilotage skills.Another 1682 Whig ballad,, ruefully expresses dissatisfaction with the political realities of the situation after thedisaster, noting that \u2018A Popish Duke goes where he will \u2026 Sometimes by Sea sometimes by land\u2019 with a \u2018troop\u2019 at \u2018his Arse\u2019, but \u2018young Jemmy\u2019 is called a \u2018rioter\u2019 for merely going out \u2018to take the air\u2019, and asking its readers to \u2018judge if this be fair\u2019.Whig anger and disgust at James\u2019s triumph is palpable. Indeed, though the Whig ballad asserts that Tory supporters are small in numbers, their superior propaganda machine (\u2018Popish Nat\u2019, the printer Nathaniel Thompson) can print \u2018ten thousand lies an hour\u2019 and thus \u2018drown\u2019 the Whigs with their noise.In other words, drowning is the Whigs\u2019 fate following James\u2019s political and actual rescue from the.It is also noticeable that, after James returned to court in May 1682, there were subtle changes in the use in Tory literary depictions of ship of state tropes in relation to him. Revealingly, Tory ballads and poems written in the wake of thedisaster appear to pivot away from focusing on James\u2019s personal skills as a pilot\u2014tacit acknowledgement, perhaps, of his damaged reputation in this area. Instead, Tory propaganda focuses on his escape from the wreck as evidence that he has a divine mandate to be the future monarch, and uses it to praise his fortitude. For example, Nahum Tate and Dryden used theshipwreck as the narrative climax for(1682), in which \u2018Royal Sir\u2019 (James), on attempting to return to Israel (England), finds that \u2018treacherous Sands the Princely Barque devour\u2019, despite the apparently calm sailing conditions, with the result that \u2018A bitter grief must poyson half our joy\u2019 on the heir\u2019s return home.In fact, \u2018Before the promis\u2019d Empire be enjoy\u2019d\u2019 by the Duke, it is clear he must endure multiple \u2018Suff\u2019rings\u2019 at the hands of \u2018long opposing Gods\u2019 before he is able to land safely home where his \u2018Suff\u2019rings Rest\u2019.James\u2019s skills, or lack of them, as pilot of the ship of state no longer determine his fitness to rule; instead, his selection by divine powers to be the nation\u2019s future monarch (\u2018promis\u2019d Empire\u2019) is decisive. The wreck clearly tarnished James\u2019s reputation as a competent pilot of the ship of state, perhaps sowing the seeds of doubt about his abilities even among his Tory followers, but it nevertheless reinforced his divine right to succeed to the throne.Notwithstanding the politically motivated differences in the ways Whig and Tory publications reported the wreck of the, and subtle changes in Tory depictions of James in its wake, two courts martial were swiftly held in London to determine responsibility. These legal proceedings over who or what caused the tragedy contributed to ongoing disputes concerning the direction of the Restoration navy, a sphere in which political disagreements between Whigs and Tories played out. The first court martial, held on 6 June 1682 on the, was brought against the\u2019s pilot, Ayres, with Sir Richard Haddock, the newly appointed Comptroller of the Navy and Commander in Chief of all his Majesty\u2019s Ships and Vessels in the River Thames and Narrow Seas, presiding.Court records have not survived from Ayres\u2019s trial, but according to Gunman\u2019s journal he was \u2018condemned to prisonment during life\u2019, though he did not serve a long sentence in the Marshalsea since one year later, on 5 June 1683, Charles II ordered his release: \u2018James Aires late Pylott of his Majesties ship the Gloucester & now a prisoner in your custody to be released & sett att liberty\u2019.This sentence was handed down despite James\u2019s expectation, as revealed in his letter to William of Orange, that Ayres would receive his \u2018doom\u2019.The second court martial, on 13 June 1682, was against Gunman and William Sturgion (or Sturgeon), captain and first mate respectively of the. Until now, historians have not been able to corroborate Gunman\u2019s version of events. Gunman\u2019s account provides valuable, though subjective, information about the conduct of the courts martial and makes a number of complaints concerning the unfair treatment he claimed to have received. Haddock presided at both trials; the other members of the board included John Churchill\u2019s younger brother, George, and the captains of two of the ships that had accompanied the, George St Loe of theand Thomas Allin of the.Gunman states that at Ayres\u2019s court martial \u2018on the 6th Sir Richard Haddok tould me that he had nothing to say to me\u2019, but this apparently altered once Gunman gave evidence about his own actions on the morning of the wreck.Gunman said that when the, which had not kept in standard sailing formation behind the fleet\u2019s flagship but was ahead, found itself in seven fathom of shoal water (see), Gunman ordered the gunner\u2019s mate Elizeas Blyth to wave a Jack flag five times in warning instead of firing a gun, the latter action being standard admiralty practice at the time. Gunman justified the order since \u2018hee knew not whether hee was to Windward or to Leeward of the Sand\u2019 and \u2018should hee have been to Windward of the Sand the Admiral to windward of him might have gone cleare without a signall and bearing downe to Leeward of him might have runn upon the Sand and therefore did not fire a gunn\u2019.Until Gunman was sure of his position in relation to the sandbanks, warning the\u2014with its deeper draught\u2014using a gunshot was as likely to put the flagship in danger as to save it, he argued. He also claimed that the policy of firing a gun in warning was neither standard admiralty practice nor a fixed rule, since \u2018he had not them [i.e. rules] \u2026 in tenn yeares\u2019 and \u2018doth not looke upon them for Instructions to bee alwaies in force but made for the present Occasion and Expedition and alterable\u2019.In fact, the Duke of York\u2019sissued in 1672\u201373 had included this specific directive.\u2018Captain Gunman\u2019s Cause\u2019, showing the ships\u2019 relative positions when thehit the sandbank and the depth of water: \u2018The postures wee were in stering NNW the wind at E: Runing after the Rate of 9: leagues a watch The sand Trenching NW: & SE: the Glocester E by S of me when I came on the Deck: about \u00bd: a mile distance\u2019.

INSTRUCTION: Please crop the image vertically down the middle and use the right-hand half only, as shown in this image:The court martial found Gunman guilty since he admitted that he had disregarded admiralty policy. It acquitted Sturgion, who was judged to have been following Gunman\u2019s orders. As a result, Gunman recorded, on 13 June he was \u2018dismissed my employ, imprisoned and fined a years pay\u2019 for \u2018breach of orders\u2019, though he maintained that \u2018I never received any orders to that purpose\u2019.It is not recorded what length of sentence he received, but Gunman was incensed by the court\u2019s decision and by Haddock\u2019s personal conduct, complaining about irregular legal processes: \u2018I doe believe I am the first suposed Crimenall that ever was brought to Tryall without first having a coppy of his indictment \u2026 to make his defence on\u2019.Gunman also stated that on 6 June, within an hour of Ayres\u2019s case being concluded, and after he had been told by Haddock that he had no case to answer, Haddock had secretly written a warrant for the arrest of Gunman\u2019s gunner\u2019s mate Elizeas Blyth, \u2018unknowne to me, And as I am informed by some of the Captains of the Court, unknowne to them\u2019.Gunman alleged that Haddock was determined to blame him, and solicited evidence against him through witness intimidation: \u2018now I find this Mate hath bien tampered with in prison\u2019. Blyth was told that he was under threat of bankruptcy at Gunman\u2019s instigation, \u2018that I had clapt him in prison and that he should loose all his pay\u2019.Gunman likewise claimed that the\u2019s carpenter was asked to make false statements.Evidence to support Gunman\u2019s claims of witness tampering has not been found until now. In the papers of George Legge in the Staffordshire Record Office, there is a deposition by Thomas Monck, carpenter on the. On 23 June 1682, Monck gave evidence to John Moore, Lord Mayor of London, that the day before Gunman\u2019s court martial the first mate Sturgion had from prison asked Monck to perjure himself by incriminating Gunman. Monck alleged that Sturgion asked him to testify that when thesailed into shallow water Sturgion \u2018did desire Captain Christopher Gunman his Commander to fire a gune, And did also desire the deponent to testify that hee heard Captain Gunman hereupon say this Expression \u201cgods wounds had they (meaning the ship Glocester) not leads and lines aboard to sound aswell as wee\u201d\u2019.Monck also deposed that Sturgion\u2019s claim at the trial that Gunman had instructed Monck not to attend was \u2018utterly falce & scandalous and ownely a defamation against Captain Gunman, for that Captain Gunman never gave him the deponent any directions or intimation to take Phisick or bee absent at the Tryall\u2019.From Monck\u2019s testimony it is clear that there was a plan to blame Gunman for the wreck, though Monck\u2019s evidence does not identify any individuals behind it other than Sturgion, who may simply have been seeking to protect himself.Gunman remarked on the harshness of his treatment in comparison to the judgment against Ayres. He claimed that Ayres \u2018is the Presedent\u2019s perticullar bosome creature\u2019 and that Haddock spoke in support of him at the pilot\u2019s court martial: \u2018For otherwise hee would never had prepared the court as hee did with a harangue in the pilot\u2019s praise on the 6of June \u2026 wich he ended with these words, viz. that he would pawne his salvation on the said pylott was he to go to sea again\u2019.Gunman\u2019s anger is tangible when highlighting what he saw as the pilot\u2019s lenient sentence (\u2018ownely emprisoned\u2019) in contrast to his own: \u2018very unjustly\u2019 \u2018turned out of my employ, emprisoned, and to loose a whole yeares pay\u2019, \u2018which I think doth shew forth sufficiently their partiallety\u2019.If Gunman\u2019s account is true\u2014and Monck\u2019s deposition is powerful evidence that there was indeed a plot against him\u2014it is also vital to understand why Haddock (or indeed those working with him or behind him) wanted Gunman to be blamed; in turn, this yields important insights into the larger political significance of the wreck and attempts to manage its aftermath by competing factions with particular agendas, as well as about disputes within the Restoration navy over future direction. One answer is suggested by how quickly the verdict against Gunman was overturned and by whom. James evidently intervened, since Gunman received a royal pardon almost immediately, notwithstanding his neglect of the Duke\u2019s. With palpable relief, Gunman remarked on James\u2019s continued personal support: on 13 June 1682, the day of the court martial, Gunman stated \u2018His Royal Highness who then on bord the Glosester both saw the action and knew my inosenssey, and being well asured of both, did cause \u2026 all the sentence of the said Court Marshall to be remitted unto me\u2019. Just ten days later, on 23 June, he noted, \u2018I received a commission again for the Mary yacht\u2019.Gunman was thus re-employed by the Crown on the day Monck\u2019s deposition was taken.The political and religious dynamics behind these events are open to interpretation. It has been suggested by some commentators that the wreck was a failed plot by Ayres, who was acting \u2018as an agent for a party of conspirators who desired the death of the Duke of York\u2019.No contemporary evidence survives to support this conspiracy, beyond a gossipy letter to a recusant supporter of the Duke\u2014Francis Radcliffe, third baronet, of Dilston Hall in Northumberland\u2014calling Ayres a \u2018known Republican\u2019 and suggesting \u2018it\u2019s not only suspicious but evident he designed his ruin with the whole ship, having made a provision for his own escape\u2019. The letter was written a few days after the wreck, when wild rumours were circulating.In the febrile atmosphere in the wake of the Popish Plot, and with a bitterly entrenched political gulf between Whigs and Tories, it is unsurprising that Catholics would suspect a Protestant conspiracy to murder the Duke. It had been rumoured in 1680, for instance, that a conspiracy was fomenting in the navy, led by the Cromwellian naval officer William Goodsonn (or Goodson), a known separatist.In 1662, Goodsonn had been (falsely) accused of complicity in a plot to kill the king, and during the Exclusion Crisis it was again reported that \u2018Goodson, an old seaman\u2019 had attempted to recruit mariners by seeking assurances that \u2018they will be right and true Protestants, and will throw their officers overboard\u2019.Historians who suggest that the Duke was the intended victim of Ayres\u2019s failed plot explain the treatment of Gunman at his trial as scapegoating, suggesting that Ayres\u2019s co-conspirators, Haddock and Captain Wyborne of the, sought to protect their man by blaming someone else.Without further evidence, this \u2018Republican\u2019 plot is unconvincing, since Ayres was ordered to be released in 1683 by Charles II, an unlikely outcome if he was believed to be a failed assassin of the king\u2019s brother.Monck\u2019s deposition does confirm a conspiracy against Gunman, but there is no evidence that it was part of an attempt to murder James.A more likely explanation for the conduct and outcome of the two courts martial is that they were part of an ongoing power struggle over the direction of the navy, which took on renewed urgency with York\u2019s return to court and growing political influence. Haddock, though a Tory royalist and client of James,was also a long-standing advocate for the professionalisation of the navy, opposed to \u2018gentlemen commanding in the navy, who for the most part, meet with more accidents (too many of their own making) than a seaman captain\u2019.Writing in 1692, and with thetragedy probably in mind, Haddock complained: \u2018Ever since the year 1660, that gentlemen came to command in the navy, these accidents have been too oft repeated upon us, to the loss of many ships and men unexpectedly \u2026 most of which for want of seamanship in not timely well navigating his ship\u2019.The Stuart brothers\u2019 favoured policy of promoting \u2018gentlemen captains\u2019 at the expense of experienced professional sailors meant that by the 1680s naval commands were dominated by gentlemen who often had little or no prior naval experience.James was most closely associated with the policy of promoting \u2018gentlemen captains\u2019; Whigs claimed that they were likely to be secret papists and/or agents of the French King Louis XIV or Rome, and criticised James for imposing his own \u2018arbitrary\u2019 and autocratic designs on the navy.A similar struggle for control over policy and direction between the Stuart brothers and the admiralty can be seen in Berry\u2019s \u2018Irish squadron\u2019, to which thehad been assigned, which was under the king\u2019s direction, according to orders issued on 3 April 1682 and administered through his Secretary of State Sir Leoline Jenkins. This new direction \u2018brazenly sidelined the Admiralty\u2019 and was most probably developed during March and early April, when James was reunited with his brother in Newmarket.The command of thesquadron clearly represented a further step in the consolidation of power over the navy into the Stuart brothers\u2019 hands.The return of York to political prominence in the spring of 1682 meant that Haddock\u2019s own newly acquired leadership role in the navy was likely to become more circumscribed, as James would be in a position to attempt to take back direct control.Haddock was a professional seaman from a family whose maritime service dated back generations: his grandfather had been a \u2018tarpaulin captain\u2019 who had served with distinction during the interregnum, eventually becoming Vice-Admiral, and his father was a naval captain.Knighted in 1675 for heroic action at the Battle of Solebay, Haddock had served from around 1653 in naval ships or on merchant vessels; from 1675, he was an Elder Brother of Trinity House, London, a body that regulated pilots under the authority of its royal charter. Like Haddock, Ayres was a captain and pilot who was working his way up the ranks rather than being awarded positions of responsibility thanks to birth or patronage, and he too had served with distinction at Solebay. Ayres was pilot in 1672 on Sir Robert Holmes\u2019s ship, which was involved in rescuing James from his wrecked flagship, the. After James had come aboard, it seems that Ayres was vital in carrying out the recommendation of the\u2019s pilot John Thompson to tack,thus preventing thefrom going aground on the Red Shoal off Lowestoft. It is reported that \u2018[n]o sooner had he [Thompson] uttered the words than he and another standing by him were killed by the same round shot \u2026 Sir Robert Holmes\u2019 pilot [Ayres] agreed with the advice \u2026 and the ship was tacked\u2019.Ayres was clearly known to both James and Haddock, and professionally familiar with the waters and channels off the east coast of England. It was on James\u2019s personal recommendation that he was piloting the: \u2018The pilot is one Ayres, a man that has heretofore served the Duke as pilot in the war, and in his voyage hither, and one greatly valued as such by him\u2019, wrote Pepys.Certainly, on 6 April 1681, James had requested Sir William Stapleton, Governor of the Leeward Islands, to regrant Ayres 200 acres of land in Antigua which had been forfeited \u2018in consideracon of his services (he being personally knowne to me)\u2019, indicating he would \u2018looke upon\u2019 \u2018your kindnesse to him\u2019 \u2018as a particular marke of your regard to my Recomendacon\u2019.It is not known whether Ayres had been in James\u2019s company in the months prior to thevoyage: it is possible he might have piloted James to Yarmouth from Scotland in March 1682, when the Duke had travelled on theyacht, captained by William Faseby, to meet King Charles at Newmarket, experiencing \u2018very ill weather in the voyage\u2019.After the shipwreck, perhaps in shock at the loss of life and vessel, but simultaneously aware that his own conduct would be harshly judged by his enemies, James\u2014and his followers\u2014quickly blamed the pilot for the disaster, advocating his immediate or later execution. The commission for the court martial that Haddock received from the office of the admiralty could not have been more explicit in its directions regarding Ayres\u2019s culpability: since \u2018his Majesty\u2019s ship the Gloucester was lately cast away on the Lemon, by the wilfulnesse, carlesnesse or Ignorance of James Ayres then Pylott onboard\u2019, Haddock was required \u2018to proceed to enquire into, & examine concerning all Crimes or offences committed by the said persons or any other persons\u2019.In order to preside over the court martial Haddock needed to be proclaimed a ship\u2019s captain, and a new vessel, the, yet to be launched, was selected\u2014an honour perhaps purposely chosen to remind Haddock that the Stuart brothers expected their wishes to be followed.Haddock\u2019s defence of Ayres disobeyed James\u2019s requirement for a suitable scapegoat and, even more strikingly, Haddock\u2019s attention then turned to Gunman, the Duke\u2019s known personal favourite.Gunman, like Ayres and Haddock, was a seaman by profession not patronage, and of modest background, so he too might have expected leniency from Haddock.Indeed, in broad terms, the composition of the board at both Ayres\u2019s and Gunman\u2019s trials included a number of men who were likely to be supportive of professionalising the navy and, perhaps, of trimming the arbitrary powers of the Stuart brothers over naval decisions. Captain Allin of thecame from a Suffolk naval dynasty, and St Loe of thewas the first successful candidate (on 2 January 1678) to pass a formal examination to become a lieutenant and secure a naval commission.A further possible connection between Ayres and Haddock may be important in explaining the outcomes of the two courts martial and Haddock\u2019s differing attitudes towards the defendants. J.D. Davies writes that, though he was \u2018often suspected of retaining the dissenting religious tendencies of his youth, after the Restoration Haddock conformed at least outwardly to the established church\u2019.Yet evidence suggests that Haddock did continue to attend nonconformist conventicles, despite the illegal nature of such places of worship after the Conventicle Acts: a letter from William Shermar to Sir Richard Dereham of 4 January 1682 notes that \u2018Sir Richard Haddock was at Watson\u2019s Conventicle\u2019.Thomas Watson was a prominent Presbyterian preacher, known to speak at Crosby House, London and, like Haddock, a royalist.Ayres may also have been a religious dissenter: records survive of a \u2018James Ayers\u2019 in December 1672 being granted a licence to hold a congregational meeting at Fairlawns, Kent, the house of Lady Frances Vane (d. 1679), widow of the executed Sir Henry Vane the Younger, the influential politician, political theorist and proponent of religious toleration.The evidence is slight but tantalising, and other sources certainly indicate that the pilot Ayres was resident in England during late 1672 when the fleet was inactive.In the 1680s, religious dissenters were still being prosecuted under the Conventicle Acts, and there may have been an affinity between Ayres and Haddock arising from fears that dissenting religious beliefs rendered their position in the Restoration navy uncertain. Over the winter of 1681/2, the situation was so strained that reports of naval officers attending conventicles were investigated as a step towards a larger-scale purge of dissenters from the navy as the admiralty politically shifted towards a \u2018Tory\u2019 position via a number of new key appointments.Shermar\u2019s record of Haddock\u2019s attendance at a conventicle was clearly part of this larger surveillance operation, though the report was evidently not enough to check Haddock\u2019s own new appointment early in 1682. Given Haddock\u2019s royalism, it is impossible to believe that he would have been in sympathy with anyone with \u2018known Republican\u2019 views, as has been suggested of Ayres.Perhaps it was merely a turn of phrase, but, as has already been noted, Haddock concluded his statement in support of Ayres at the court martial on 6 June by saying he would \u2018pawne his salvation on the said pylott\u2019.Notwithstanding the possibility that Haddock held dissenting religious convictions, a key question remains to be answered: why would the court martial board of 13 June, comprising professional sea captains, discipline Gunman harshly since he was a fellow professional naval man? First, though Gunman claimed that the admiralty policy of firing a gun to warn of shoal water was more honoured in the breach than in the observance, it was one of the Duke\u2019s. The court\u2019s judgment was legally and technically correct: Gunman had failed to follow standing sailing orders both by sailing out of formation and by not firing a warning gun when in shoal water. Even more importantly, Gunman was well known to be especially intimate with James, having been given command of his yacht thein 1669 and having been in Scotland in the family\u2019s service during James\u2019s residence for much of 1681/2. There was a particular frisson, or irony, at work in Haddock\u2019s and the board\u2019s actions: using James\u2019s own sailing rules to discipline Gunman was a tactical master-stroke in a broader campaign to professionalise the navy, especially as the Duke was known to be punctilious, even pedantic, about orders being obeyed. James\u2019swere designed to inculcate discipline in naval officers by removing their latitude for individual decision-making, since the Duke believed \u2018the ability to follow a carefully constructed series of orders to the letter was the only sure key to victory\u2019\u2014something that Haddock opposed, believing officers needed the ability to be tactically responsive to individual situations to be victorious at sea.By exercising his own judgement\u2014sailing ahead of the squadron flagship and deciding that flag-waving was more effective than firing a gun to warn of danger\u2014instead of following his master\u2019s standing orders, Gunman\u2019s behaviour offered Haddock an opportunity to challenge James\u2019s policy by imposing it.Gunman\u2019s relationship with James may have caused jealousy among other members of the squadron. Gunman\u2019s journal reveals just how frequently he was with him, and because after the wreck they had sailed together to Scotland on the, Gunman was asked to pilot the fourth-ratefor the Duke\u2019s journey back to London, displacing Wyborne.Once at Tilbury on 27 May, James ordered Gunman to resume command of theand sail the royal family further up the Thames.James\u2019s reliance on Gunman is unmistakable.At his court martial on 13 June, Gunman expressed his surprise at Wyborne and his mates\u2019 evidence, and the hostility shown:for W. (without being called thereunto) stands up and swears I bore away one full quarter of an hour before the wind which at the rate we then run must carry me full 2 miles to leeward ... Now there went a big sea \u2026 then a leeward tide which against both would not have suffered me to have come up with the duke in three hours time \u2026 And it is well known to HRH that I was up with him long before his boat was hoisted out, so these two persons might as well have sworn I did kill a man at Barbados at that very time and hour.Perhaps it was professional or personal jealousy on Wyborne\u2019s part that made him declare that Gunman was sailing so very far ahead of the. Or perhaps Wyborne\u2019s evidence was motivated by anger, since James had deprived him, through no fault of his own, of authority over his own vessel by awarding to Gunman the navigation of the. In doing this, even temporarily, James had appropriated the powers of the Admiralty Board, behaving as if he had authority to commission and relieve English naval officers of their command. Whatever Wyborne\u2019s motivation for volunteering evidence, Gunman stated that he was only half a mile from the lee bow of thewhen the ship ran aground, going so far as to draw a diagram of the respective positions of the vessels in the account of events now in Legge\u2019s papers (see). Wyborne\u2019s accusation provoked Gunman\u2019s blistering sarcasm about his miraculous ability to be in two places simultaneously. If Wyborne\u2019s testimony was accurate, in such a sea and against a strong wind, Gunman insisted that he would never have been able so quickly to get theclose enough to theto rescue the Duke.Pepys, though not exonerating Gunman (even-handedly, he refers to the wreck as \u2018the evil occasioned by Captain Gunman and the pilot\u2019s misbehaviour\u2019), felt that the court martial was irregularly conducted.He commented in his naval minutes on the \u2018impropriety of a court-martial of commanders to judge of the ignorance or negligence of a master or pilot\u2019 when not expert in such matters, and appears uneasy that Gunman\u2019s trial was conducted privately, \u2018none being present at the examining of the witnesses\u2019. He also records his disquiet that the carpenter (Monck) was not examined, though Monck, Gunman alleged, had confessed to him attempts at intimidation by forces hostile to Gunman.Pepys evidently used the trials to consider whether such a disaster should ever be considered a capital offence, \u2018reflecting well upon the consequence of those sentences, by which it is in consequence declared that no miscarriage either of ship or fleet by any degree of ignorance in a master or pilot can be capital\u2019, and vowed to \u2018discourse with Sir Richard Haddocke\u2019 about the \u2018examinations, trials, and sentences\u2019.Indeed, for Pepys and Legge, the fatal example of thehighlighted a crucial question, yet to be properly addressed by the navy, concerning who was ultimately responsible for navigating a ship: the captain, master or pilot? Pepys hoped to regularise the process of pilot selection through policy reform rather than, as happened with the, \u2018leave it to the Duke to take whom he pleased\u2019.Over the next two years, Pepys and Legge complained about \u2018how far the answering for navigating the ship was yet to settle in the navy\u2019, with thedisaster illustrating the consequences of current practice.Gunman\u2019s case was part of an intense power struggle over the \u2018arbitrary\u2019 influence on the direction and control of the navy that a newly resurgent York would be able to command in the future and was already seeking to assert. Gunman\u2019s treatment by Haddock and the other officers at the court martial was the proverbial shot across the bows, designed to warn rather than harm, since Haddock would have calculated that James would not allow his favourite yacht captain to languish for long, and in fact Haddock probably did not wish him to do so either. Nevertheless, the court martial had applied the rule of naval law rather than capricious royal whim. Indeed, as Gunman commented, his sentence was very particular in that it revealed the limits of James\u2019s powers. The Duke did not have the authority immediately to lift the fine Gunman was given, of a year\u2019s wages for the Chatham Chest to support injured seamen, since this was not under his jurisdiction.The message to the Duke, and indeed Charles II, was clear: some in the navy wished to \u2018trim\u2019 or moderate royal sway and encourage respect for the authority of the Admiralty Board. It was done subtly, rather than by direct confrontation. By the autumn of 1682 Gunman and Haddock were reconciled at the Duke\u2019s express behest: \u2018his RH commanded Sir Richard Haddock & myself\u2019, wrote Gunman, \u2018to become good friends as Whee had bien formerly & would nott let us part until it was soe\u2019.Is the wreck of thesignificant for understanding the political difficulties of James Stuart, or just a dramatic but fleeting episode in his turbulent life? Critics to date have argued for the latter view. If James had drowned in 1682, then British history would have looked very different, since \u2018young Jemmy\u2019, the Duke of Monmouth, might well have inherited the throne as James II and VII; or perhaps another civil war might have ensued between those who supported the claim of King Charles\u2019s illegitimate Protestant son against the claims of the Duke of York\u2019s legitimate Protestant daughter and her foreign husband. Instead, after an initial flurry of interest in the wreck, the event largely receded from the public view\u2014though anniversary poems and other treatments continued to be produced intermittently, including in 1704 a comic poem, possibly by Daniel Defoe, about the adventures of Mumper, a royal hound who perished in the wreck.The spectacular political events of the bloody Monmouth Rebellion in 1685 and, in 1688, the \u2018bloodless\u2019 deposition of James II in favour of William III and Mary II have consigned thewreck to the status of a historical footnote. Yet the depth of interest in the disaster immediately following the event, and the complexities and cross-currents in the ways the event itself and James\u2019s behaviour were reported, the contrast in the ways those blamed for its occurrence were treated by the navy, and new archival evidence that supports Gunman\u2019s claims of a plot against him, suggest that a reassessment of its political and cultural significance is required.The tragedy cast a long shadow even though its full political effects were not immediately felt, since the events on theraised pointed questions about James\u2019s judgement under pressure, his fitness to rule and his attitude to the governance of the navy, a significant branch of Restoration state apparatus. In the aftermath of the wreck, a key area of debate in the navy, and in wider cultural discourse, was where the authority to select a pilot resided. Perhaps because of the rigours of the experience itself, perhaps because Gunman\u2019s treatment revealed to James the determination of some naval leaders to resist his personal control of the service, or even because his miraculous, divinely chosen and Jonah-like survival cemented his belief in his God-given right to rule, James determinedly sought to resume the role of Lord High Admiral of England and to use the navy as an instrument to enact his royal will. It was not, however, until his accession to the throne in 1685 that he finally succeeded in being reappointed to the office. Yet from his arrival in London on thein May 1682, using the authority of his brother, James wasdirecting naval operations, employing his clients in key positions to make the navy increasingly Tory, and challenging the authority of the Admiralty Commission, the body designed to replace him in his naval responsibilities following the Test Act.Harbingers for the decisive wreck of James\u2019s ship of state in 1688 are evident in the sinking of the. Key individuals involved with the\u2014such as Churchill, onboard with James, or Haddock, tasked to establish culpability for the wreck, or Laurence Hyde, who lost his youngest brother in the tragedy\u2014deserted to William and Mary, rather than maintain James as both commander and pilot of the state. Even prior to James\u2019s shipwreck, Churchill, Legge and Hyde were expressing privately to each other their concerns about James\u2019s aptitude, even perhaps fitness, to rule. In September 1681, these \u2018moderate\u2019 Anglicans attempted repeatedly to bring the Duke back to the Church of England in order to secure his succession; having failed in their efforts, Churchill bleakly wrote to Legge: \u2018you will find that nothing is done in that which was so much desired, soe that sooner or laiter we must all be undone\u2019.Churchill, Legge and Hyde had concerns over James\u2019s use of Catholic Highlanders to persecute Scottish Covenanters, and his determination to condemn to death for treason the Earl of Argyll for opposing a clause in the Test Act that exempted James from taking the Protestant oath of allegiance. As George Savile, earl of Halifax, at the time the most senior member of the moderate Tory faction, succinctly put it, if James would not moderate himself, then \u2018his friends would be obliged to leave him like a garrison one could no longer defend\u2019.Despite the royalist Tory version of James as a \u2018Royal Heroe\u2019 and new \u2018\u00c6neas\u2019, the wreck showed the Duke\u2019s limitations as a leader and his determination to assert the royal prerogative at all costs.Sarah Churchill, writing later about her husband\u2019s view of the wreck as it was reported to her immediately after it happened, indicated that he was critical of James\u2019s \u2018obstinacy and cruelty\u2019; likewise, Legge\u2019s son reported that his father had been frustrated by the avoidable delay in the Duke agreeing to abandon ship.A believer in strict rules and regulations for others, and punishment for those who disobeyed them, James did not apply the same standards to his own behaviour, illegitimately appropriating for himself admiralty authority and seeking to overturn almost immediately the legitimate verdict of a court martial for his favourite Gunman. The wreck of 1682, which might initially have looked like a further example of bad luck, in fact reflected James\u2019s failures of leadership\u2014his stubbornness and lack of flexibility, his scapegoating of others and his determination to impose his royal will. It was an event that damaged his prestige in the years to come by showing graphically his inability to pilot the ship of state, and a lack of judgement that came to characterise his short reign, ultimately leading to its foundering."

    "title": "The Grand Tour of Mercantilism: Lord Fauconberg\u2019s Italian Mission (1669\u20131671)*",
    "author": "Maria Fusaro",
    "date": "07 June 2022",
    "text": "The extraordinary mission of Lord Fauconberg to some of the Italian states in 1669\u20131671 took place at a pivotal moment in early modern diplomatic relations, and is a most evocative case-study of the relationship between Restoration England and Europe in the last decades of the seventeenth century. This article will provide a close analysis of the mission and its protagonists, aiming to re-evaluate English diplomacy through cross-referencing English and Italian documentary evidence, but with a special attention to the Italian side of the story. By analysing how the Republic of Venice and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany\u2014the major Italian trade partners of England\u2013\u2013perceived and interpreted English trade policy, it provides an original analysis of Caroline diplomacy and trade in the early Restoration era.During the spring and summer of 1670, Lord Fauconberg toured the Italian peninsula on an extraordinary diplomatic mission.[CITATION-1] Visiting the Duchy of Savoy, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the two Republics of Genoa and Venice, he followed an itinerary which is usually studied under the cultural and social lens of the Grand Tour; but in this case there was no educational goal, although plenty of artworks were indeed purchased alongside the diplomatic negotiations.[CITATION-2] Fauconberg had a clearly defined agenda centred on the furthering of English commercial interests in the peninsula; in the case of Venice, this was accompanied by Charles II\u2019s ambition of acquiring a larger role in mediating between European states and the Ottoman Empire. Still reeling from defeat in the second Anglo-Dutch conflict (1665\u201367), and having to deal with fragile alliances and clashing ambitions on the European stage, Charles II was keen on furthering English trade in the Mediterranean: hence this Grand Tour of Mercantilism. Recent studies have profoundly transformed the well-worn and contested concept of mercantilism, giving it a level of nuance and problematisation that was missing before. Over the past few years, an active and lively conversation among Anglo-Americanists has \u2018rethought\u2019, \u2018reimagined\u2019 and \u2018reconstructed\u2019 mercantilism.[CITATION-3] Jonathan Barth has recently posited that, within the English setting, a long-term concern with the balance of trade can be seen as the pillar of political economy between the 1620s and the time of David Hume and Adam Smith.[CITATION-4] Several debates raged about the direction of economic policy during this period, but agreement on the need for a positive balance of trade remained the unifying factor.In the massive scholarship on these issues, traditionally centred on British Atlantic and imperial perspectives, the economic connection between Italy and England has been neglected, though it was a primary stage where diverging approaches to the regulation of trade were both actively present and jostling for supremacy. From the English perspective, the Italian peninsula was divided in two: on one side, the monopoly of the Levant Company, extending to the territories of the Republic of Venice; on the other, the thriving Mediterranean private trade which had contributed to the rise of the Livorno free port.One of the aims of this article is to provide an alternative perspective on these issues, and also to engage with how the Italian states\u2019 political and diplomatic perceptions of England can shed some new light both on English foreign and commercial policy and on its culture of diplomacy. The article starts by setting out the background of English diplomatic relations with Italian states after the beginning of the seventeenth century, briefly discussing their complexity especially during the time of the Protectorate. It then moves on to the Restoration, sketching how the wider European stage influenced Caroline foreign and diplomatic policy. After a short excursus on diplomatic protocol, which provides an insight into the insecurities of all players, the article closely follows Fauconberg\u2019s travels around the peninsula, giving particular attention to his stays in Tuscany and Venice. The article concludes by analysing the aftermath of Fauconberg\u2019s visit, focusing on how the issues he had raised developed in the following months, when English diplomatic activity in the Mediterranean was superseded by naval operations.After the long interruptions of diplomatic relations caused by Henry VIII\u2019s break with Rome, the first English ambassador to Venice of the seventeenth century, Henry Wotton, arrived in 1604 with a remit that put him in \u2018charge of all matters of trade in Italian ports\u2019.[CITATION-5] The English ambassador in Venice was a straightforwardly political appointee, unlike his counterpart in the Ottoman empire, who was an employee of the Levant Company endorsed by the sovereign. The pre-eminence of the political element led to Wotton\u2019s being originally \u2018commissioned to act as superior to the English ambassador at Constantinople, who was ordered to take his policy from him\u2019.[CITATION-6] This clearly expressed the Crown\u2019s desire to maintain some control over the Levant Company\u2019s activities in the Eastern Mediterranean.As the century progressed, English political channels to the Ottomans became detached from Venice. Within the Italian peninsula, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany acquired its own ambassador; however, Venice remained the centre of English concerns in Italy until the onset of the British Civil Wars, which utterly disrupted the English diplomatic structure. Diplomatic relations with Venice effectively ceased in 1652, when the royal resident Thomas Killigrew left Venice under something of a cloud on account of his taking advantage of his diplomatic status to engage in illegal meat trading.[CITATION-7] Representing, in his words, \u2018an unlucky prince\u2019, Killigrew\u2019s residency had not been a political success, and indeed had been a source of embarrassment for the Republic, which was most keen to avoid antagonising the Protectorate.[CITATION-8] In the following years, the Republic displayed its trademark political subtlety in dealing with England. After the interruption of direct diplomatic contacts, the Venetian Senato relied on its ambassador in France to co-ordinate a network of private informants and secret agents to relay information from England.The situation in the central decades of the century was delicate at every level. Within the framework of international politics, the Republic found itself in a particularly difficult position: as a \u2018republican\u2019 government it needed to balance its position between its supposed affinities with the Protectorate and its share in the general European distaste for a regime which had committed regicide. At the same time, deep economic and strategic interests tied the two countries together: English merchants were active both in Venice and in its empire, especially in the Ionian Islands, where they dominated the crucial trade in currants. Even more delicate was the handling of the involvement of English shipping in the War of Candia (1646\u201369), where it gave essential logistical support to the Venetian fleet.[CITATION-9] Formally recognising the Protectorate\u2014as was sometimes suggested by Venetian senators, with an eye to increasing support to the Venetian fleet\u2014was tempting, given the growing prowess of the Navy under its control. But it was deemed too dangerous, and ultimately unlikely to bear fruit, given that Cromwell was keen to maintain the neutrality of England in this conflict in order to appease the lobbying of the Levant Company in London.[CITATION-10] The Anglo-Venetian diplomatic impasse did not immediately change with the Stuart Restoration, even though the English crown was increasingly engaged in diplomatic activity during the 1660s all over Europe, with extraordinary ambassadors sent out to re-establish diplomatic links which had been severed, and to negotiate new agreements.[CITATION-11] By the end of the decade, English diplomacy was working to maximise the advantages deriving from the Franco-Dutch confrontation, and trying to position England as the balancing power between them.[CITATION-12] The Mediterranean situation was increasingly relevant for England, with long-standing, festering grievances now joined by new challenges. The acquisition of Tangier in 1662 had been pivotal in this regard, stimulating English imperial ambitions in the region, but also bringing renewed tension, both internally with Parliament and externally with the North African Regencies, the latter leading to increased corsairing activity in the region.[CITATION-13] The alliance with Portugal, still engulfed in the long fight to regain its independence, and the weakness of Spain, victim of the aggressive stance of Louis XIV, had allowed English diplomacy to play a central role in resolving the long conflict between the two Iberian crowns, and, in doing so, to obtain substantial economic advantages. Lord Sandwich, sent as ambassador extraordinary to Spain in 1666, and taking advantage of the panic which settled in Madrid in the aftermath of the French attack on the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comt\u00e9 in 1667, obtained from the regent Queen Mariana a treaty of commerce extremely favourable to the English, which in effect threw open the Spanish market to English imports.[CITATION-14] Among the privileges granted to the English was the ability freely to re-export goods, which provided a massive boost to English trade in the Mediterranean. This increased the English commercial presence in the Straits, and especially in the Canary Islands, which quickly brought a worsening of the relations with Sal\u00e8 and Algiers.[CITATION-15] In the autumn of 1669, an English fleet under Sir Thomas Allin attacked the Algerians, causing heavy losses. However, the operation did not prove effective, leading to the dismissal of Allin and the rise of his deputy, Sir Edward Spragge.[CITATION-16] In those same days of August 1670 when Fauconberg was in Venice, a joint Anglo-Dutch campaign destroyed more Algerian vessels. A further expedition against Bugie in early 1671 brought down the regime in Algiers, as the ruling pasha, an envoy from the Porte, was ousted after being accused of prioritising the protection of his own possessions and thus leaving the fleet weakened. The new government, headed by local deys, and therefore much less directly connected with the Ottoman empire, signed another treaty with England in 1673, but this proved to be an elusive truce\u2014as the following decades were to prove.[CITATION-17] Fauconberg\u2019s mission thus took place during a rather tumultuous period for the fledgling Restoration regime. Between 1667 and 1672 England was shaken by a serious internal political crisis, and by several changes in domestic and foreign policy, rooted in Charles II\u2019s feeling of political vulnerability, both at home and abroad.[CITATION-18] In this fast-changing scenario, Charles, keen to reinforce the conduct of foreign policy as being a royal prerogative, was actively looking for opportunities to make his own mark. In the fissile conditions of the Restoration, foreign and commercial policies were tightly intertwined. Charles\u2019s relationship with Parliament remained fragile, with the sovereign involving members of Parliament in diplomatic missions but, at the same time, operating independently, as in the secret signing of the Treaty of Dover.[CITATION-19] The conclusion of the long and financially exhausting Candia war between Venice and the Ottoman empire presented such an opportunity. The recent success of Lord Sandwich\u2019s mission to Spain, with its positive results for English trade in the Western Mediterranean, must have fostered Charles\u2019s hope that political mediation between Venice and the Ottomans could achieve the same results in the Eastern Mediterranean.Thomas Belasyse, Lord Fauconberg, was selected as Extraordinary Ambassador to the Republic of Venice. He appeared to be an ideal candidate for the job: although a staunch royalist, he was married to the daughter of Cromwell, and he was clearly a man of political skill, having had a successful career during the Interregnum and negotiated smoothly the transition into the Restoration.[CITATION-20] The Venetian ambassador in London, Pietro Mocenigo, reported back to the Senato that Fauconberg had given much evidence of his loyalty to the king, though his wife was not \u2018loved\u2019 at court, and the local gossip was that he had married her to avoid having his estate confiscated by Cromwell.[CITATION-21] Whatever his private motives, Fauconberg\u2019s personal situation should have helped him in one of the mission\u2019s objectives, that of uniting the English merchants active on the Italian Peninsula, whose political allegiances during the civil wars had been very divided. This was particularly evident in Livorno, where things had degenerated to the point where the internal divisions of the mercantile community\u2014the so-called \u2018Factory\u2019\u2014were openly discussed in Venetian diplomatic correspondence.[CITATION-22] The Italian peninsula remained a complex arena for English ambitions. Fauconberg\u2019s ownabout his mission state clearly that his long, winding itinerary around the peninsula was designed precisely to play Italian states off against each other to England\u2019s economic advantage.[CITATION-23] In this context, it is interesting to note how on the day after the funeral of his father Ferdinando, the new Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo III, granting an audience to the Venetian ambassador in Florence, Ottaviano Valier, had been at pains to pay due homage to the Republic\u2019s primacy among Italian states, and, discussing Fauconberg\u2019s mission, declared that \u2018the Princes of Italy should stay united to conserve for each other a land so fertile, beautiful and powerful, but all should also be aware of the pre-eminence of the Republic which owns its largest, richest and mightiest part\u2019, as Cosimo had seen with his own eyes in his travels.[CITATION-24] Venice was Fauconberg\u2019s ultimate destination, but all stops played a role in Charles\u2019s strategy. Tuscany was particularly significant, as Livorno had been steadily growing in importance both for English trade and for the logistical needs of the Navy. Free from the monopoly of the Levant Company (unlike Venice and its empire), it had become the operational base for all English trade in the Mediterranean and this had made it strategically crucial for the Crown.[CITATION-25] The intention was to obtain more concessions from the Grand Duke, playing on his worries about the Mediterranean ambitions of the Duchy of Savoy, which was pushing to make Villafranca (Villefranche) into an alternative hub to Livorno.[CITATION-26] Freedom of religious practice was another concern, but here Fauconberg was rather pragmatic in his analysis, acknowledging that this was unlikely to be achieved in a Savoy \u2018dominated by priests\u2019, but might be possible in Livorno, \u2018albeit discreetely\u2019. The issue of religious practice was duly mentioned, as was the continuing influence of the Pope on Italian states, \u2018especially if they be second or third rate Princes\u2019, a category from which only Venice was excluded. This dismissive attitude towards Italian states\u2019 wealth, power and military ability made it clear that, once the veil of diplomatic formality was lifted, the mission had been designed purely to strengthen English economic interests in the region.[CITATION-27] Fauconberg\u2019s instructions were overwhelmingly concerned with issues of trade policy, and mainly with smoothing the way for English merchants active on the peninsula. There was also, of course, a stress (common to such instructions) on rebuilding and reinforcing \u2018friendship\u2019 and on gathering intelligence, but the only specifically \u2018political\u2019 point concerned discreetly sounding out the current direction of Venetian foreign policy, particularly in relation to Spain and France in the aftermath of the Candia war.[CITATION-28] In a period of increasingly active political management of the economy, with foreign trade ever closely connected with military activities, this can aptly be termed a \u2018Grand Tour of mercantilism\u2019.However, the fact that Venice was the main focus of Fauconberg\u2019s mission could not but irk the governments of those \u2018second or third rate Princes\u2019 who hosted him on his way to the Republic. Fauconberg\u2019s secretary, John Dodington, openly acknowledged that the credentials had not been composed with great skill:The Credentialls to the three Places, do all expressely write that his Excellency was ultimately employed to other Princes and States, which creates a most unavoydable Inference, that His Excellency was to visit them en passant only, as pro forma tantum, for his own convenience as it were, and because they lay in his way: just as one that designs to goe for London, and visites his friends house, to save the expense of lying at the Inne.[CITATION-29] Dodington politely advised that similar wording needed to be avoided in the future.Protocol mattered in so far as it was the operational embodiment of hierarchy, and all parties had reason to be sensitive about their status. Quite apart from the well-known seventeenth-century obsession with hierarchies and their practical and public performance through diplomatic and court protocol, the \u2018almost ubiquitous quarrels about precedence\u2019 which dominated the 1640s European peace negotiations ending the Thirty Years War have been demonstrated to be expressions of issues of real political substance.[CITATION-30] During Fauconberg\u2019s mission there were several issues at play which made such considerations particularly relevant.[CITATION-31] , Charles was determined to use this diplomatic mission as a propaganda tool to re-establish England\u2019s place among the top tier of European crowns. While formally tied in the Triple Alliance with Sweden and the United Provinces, a project which the Senato was following with great interest especially through Ambassador Mocenigo in London,[CITATION-32] Charles was also negotiating the infamous Treaty of Dover, whose \u2018secret\u2019 version included his conversion to Catholicism in exchange for French financial support that would have freed him from Parliament.[CITATION-33] Within such a complex international situation, the level of honour and respect shown to Charles\u2019s ambassador was of great significance. It became directly connected with the vexed issue of naval salutes, which was an increasingly hot topic of discussion across the seas, and a main focus of conversations both in Genoa and Tuscany.[CITATION-34] The finer details of welcome ceremonials dominate the extant documentary evidence of the mission. Dodington\u2014sometimes employing an advanced party\u2014had among his principal duties that of agreeing their exact form in advance with the host authorities.[CITATION-35] There was more, as Ottaviano Valier warned the Collegio of Venice on 10 June: Fauconberg \u2018has express written instructions from His Majesty not to give his hand to any Minister\u2014be it of a Prince or Crowned Head\u2014who does not have the title and status of Ambassador\u2019.[CITATION-36] Carlo Emanuele II, duke of Savoy, was particularly sensitive to these issues as there were constant squabbles over Savoy\u2019s reciprocal order of precedence with the Grand Duke of Tuscany.[CITATION-37] Not surprisingly, then, much time and energy went into the organisation of Fauconberg\u2019s reception in Turin, where it was finally agreed he would be treated in the same way as the papal, French and Venetian ministers. All parties were sensitised to this issue: barely ten days after Fauconberg\u2019s departure from London, the Venetian and French ambassadors in Savoy agreed together on requesting the same treatment on the occasion of his entrance.[CITATION-38] And, indeed, on the day of his official welcome at Court, they also were granted audiences.[CITATION-39] A similar rigmarole took place in Genoa, and here disagreements were such that for some time it was assumed that this leg of the journey would be skipped to avoid humiliation.[CITATION-40] The Republic of Genoa was particularly sensitive to issues of protocol and hierarchy. By the seventeenth century, its glories as a pre-eminent Mediterranean maritime power were well in the past, and its present neutral state was openly challenged by many because of its close links with Spain.[CITATION-41] To defend its status, the Republic had developed an infamously self-important attitude, to the extent that the French king Louis XIV complained how ridiculous it was for the Genoese ambassadors to insist on asking for an audience on those days which were reserved specifically for representatives of kings.[CITATION-42] With both Venice and England gripped by insecurities relating to their international standing, the issue of protocol emerges from the documents with a pre-eminence and level of detail which had been absent from their past interactions. Even before Fauconberg\u2019s arrival, the Senato made sure that all relevant Venetian diplomats abroad were kept up to date on these developments.[CITATION-43] The ambassador in Savoy, Francesco Michiel, had two meetings with Fauconberg and Dodington, and discussed the modalities of Fauconberg\u2019s entry into Venice. He was relieved to explain afterwards to the Senato how it had not been necessary for him to discuss things at length:[they] expressed themselves with such concepts, which made clear that the Ambassador was clearly aware of the Republic\u2019s status equivalent to a Royal Power, while the others were of much inferior status.[CITATION-44] The English consul in Venice, George Hayles,[CITATION-45] notwithstanding assurances that \u2018the Ambassador would have been treated with all the honours which had been provided in the past for the extraordinary Ambassadors from France\u2019, had at least three separate meetings with the Collegio on this issue.[CITATION-46] Fauconberg himself paid a lot of attention to these details, and provided an extended description of the proceedings of his welcome in Venice in his report to the king.[CITATION-47] However, it is also interesting to note an alternative explanation for this punctiliousness, as given by a spy reporting to the Inquisitori di Stato:As the late Cromwell\u2019s son in law, many esteem that he is not a great friend of the present government, and that the King keeps him engaged outside of the kingdom for political reasons; but as one cannot see the inside [of his mind], on the outside he shows the uttermost respect for the honour and interests of His King.[CITATION-48] In English official diplomatic rhetoric, the primacy of Venice among Italian states continued to be restated in the face of the advancing decline of its international status. Fauconberg\u2019s conversation with Michiel in Turin started with his declaring how Britain had the \u2018mightiest [fleet] unfurling its banner in the Ocean Seas, as the Republic in the Mediterranean\u2019, and how the Triple Alliance was supposed to act as a brake on French ambitions. He insinuated further that France might have been getting closer to the Ottomans, which, together with their policy of increasing their presence on the seas, \u2018should concern everyone with ports in the Mediterranean\u2019. Michiel replied cautiously that commerce was \u2018indeed the most esteemed joy that shone in the face of Powers\u2019, and that the \u2018Venetian Lion\u2019 was the oldest standard at sea.[CITATION-49] For a few months in early 1670, Fauconberg\u2019s tour became the focus of Italian politics, his progress actively followed by all governments, and commented on by the Venetian diplomatic machine with a staggering level of detail. Part of this was the normalof Venice: since the time of Leopold Ranke, historians have acknowledged that information exchange was at the heart of the Republic\u2019s political activity.[CITATION-50] As is to be expected, diplomats and informants all kept their ears to the ground, and the Senato and Collegio received daily updates about Fauconberg\u2019s movements and activities; as was its usual practice, the Collegio also redistributed relevant information within the Venetian diplomatic network.Pietro Mocenigo, an astute analyst of English naval and maritime strength, was at the centre of this web. Throughout his embassy in London he tried to arrive at a mutually convenient understanding between Charles and the Republic, but he had grown increasingly frustrated about what he perceived as the lack of English political will to solve the long-standing problems in relations with Venice.[CITATION-51] In this context, Fauconberg\u2019s mission in Italy was pivotal for directing Mocenigo\u2019s actions, and the Senato reassured him that all relevant despatches would be forwarded to him \u2018for your own eyes, so that more deftly and carefully [you can] fathom what is true\u2019.[CITATION-52] Another characteristic of Venetian diplomacy was the ample use of well-paid and anonymous informers, and the establishment of close personal relationships with other diplomats\u2014and their own informers\u2014so as to be able to report back to Venice the most varied and complete set of opinions. To this end, Ottaviano Valier had cultivated the friendship of the English resident in Florence, John Finch, and appears to have also enjoyed the confidence of other members of his household.[CITATION-53] Finch was at pains to reassure Valier that Fauconberg would have dealt with the other princes as swiftly as he could in order to reach Venice as soon as possible.[CITATION-54] Their frequent private meetings, however, extended to a varied set of topics, and were by no means limited to the bilateral relations between the two states; Tuscany was clearly emerging as a primary centre of information collection and redistribution for the whole Mediterranean.Francesco Michiel in Turin was in a particularly delicate situation. Diplomatic relations between Savoy and Venice had been re-established in 1662 after a hiatus of more than thirty years. In the summer of 1670 they would be interrupted again, this time until the 1740s. The reason was a classic case of exquisite political formality. Even though the island had been under Ottoman sovereignty since 1571, both the Republic and the Duke of Savoy laid claim to the title of \u2018King of Cyprus\u2019, and neither was prepared to give it up.[CITATION-55] In this tense atmosphere, Michiel carefully cultivated relations with the French ambassador in Turin, and from their conversations emerges a disparaging portrait of English strategy and ambitions.[CITATION-56] The French ambassador clearly had his own official agenda to pursue, and nowhere emerges awareness of the ongoing negotiations which would lead to the Treaty of Dover. His own opinion, as reported by Michiel to the Collegio, was rather scathing:he would never advice your excellencies, not any other Italian Prince, to favour the English, as the bad quality of their nature makes them alien to people\u2019s affections; especially the Most Serene Republic should be very careful, as they promise to boost traffic in all places [where they arrive], but then when they have insinuated themselves, they ruin it with wily ways.[CITATION-57] Even though Venetians themselves had described English commercial activities in this way, Michiel played it diplomatically and replied that he took Fauconberg\u2019s embassy to Venice to be a belated response to Venice\u2019s sending two extraordinary ambassadors to Charles\u2019s coronation, followed by a permanent resident, though no English ambassador had yet arrived in Venice.[CITATION-58] The issue of Villafranca was, understandably, the main focus of Fauconberg\u2019s meeting with the Duke of Savoy. Situated next to Nice on the western borders of the state of Savoy, Villafranca\u2019s port was at the centre of the Duke\u2019s ambitions for enhancing his state\u2019s commercial income.[CITATION-59] Fauconberg promised English support and the sending of a consul to facilitate trade, and Charles\u2019s instructions are evidence of genuine interest in Villafranca\u2019s possible development, as they specifically asked the ambassador to enquire in detail \u2018how good the port is, how capable of ships of burthen, what depth of water it has\u2019.[CITATION-60] The Venetian ambassador did not seem concerned about the potential danger posed by this new entrep\u00f4t. On more than one occasion he highlighted how the general poverty of the area, the unfavourable geographical position (with surrounding mountains effectively blocking the port), and the absence of suitable roads to move merchandise all contributed to make it a rather poor location and therefore not a real threat.[CITATION-61] Conversely, Genoese merchants appeared rather worried by the potential disruption which could have been caused by Villafranca\u2019s development, and they duly talked the place down to Dutch and English merchants.[CITATION-62] Whether or not these activities came to the attention of the English delegation we do not know from the extant evidence. However, Dodington himself was very pragmatic in assessing Villafranca\u2019s potential. To the disadvantages already mentioned, he noted, it needed to be added that Marseille\u2019s recent transformation into a self-styledeffectively limited the chances of developing Villafranca into a \u2018new Livorno\u2019, and he clearly interpreted the recent arrival of a large contingent of Armenian silk merchants in Marseille as a French move to funnel that lucrative trade through that port.[CITATION-63] The English embassy\u2019s stay in Savoy ended without results, and there was little to point to the future good relationship between the two states.[CITATION-64] So far, so traditional: the Venetian diplomatic machinery had been operating in this way for centuries. However, in tracing Fauconberg\u2019s itinerary, the intensity of internal communication between Venetian diplomats across Europe needs to be underlined, with a constant stream of letters being exchanged directly between them, bypassing Venice itself. This is not to say that Venice was kept in the dark about these activities; on the contrary, in the official government papers there are constant references to such exchanges. During late 1669 and 1670, Pietro Mocenigo regularly wrote from London to Ottaviano Valier in Florence, and the latter was at pains to warmly and publicly thank him to the Senato for facilitating his work in this way.[CITATION-65] In the same months, both Mocenigo and Giovanni Morosini, the Venetian ambassador in Paris, wrote regularly to Michiel in Savoy.[CITATION-66] But in contrast to the traditional city-centric interpretation of Venetian diplomatic information networks, what emerges here is a diffused and thick web of cross-communications, one which did not necessarily have Venice itself in a dominant role and which certainly appears worthy of further investigation.Livorno, in the centre of the Mediterranean, was above all an entrep\u00f4t. Its port was a vast emporium of different goods and, consequently, also a place where incoming news and information was gathered and sorted. For English shipping, it provided logistical support of critical importance. Because of their sheer number and the vast amount of trade they controlled, the merchants of the British Factory in Livorno were the most important English trading community in the Italian peninsula. There had been an English consulate there since 1597, which at the time of Fauconberg\u2019s mission was run by Thomas Clutterbuck, a Bristol merchant and former naval agent; from 1665, the resident ambassador at the court of Florence was John Finch, a gentleman physician and naturalist.[CITATION-67] It was expected as a matter of course that Fauconberg\u2019s diplomatic Grand Tour would include a stop-off in the Grand Duchy, especially as Anglo-Tuscan relations had somewhat deteriorated. Disagreements rumbled on regarding several aspects of commercial relations. The English felt sanitary regulations to be excessively strict, and there were formal complaints about the abuses perpetrated by the customs officers, as well as about corruption, which, the English claimed, impaired the efficient working of all Tuscan institutions, beginning with the law courts.[CITATION-68] Unfortunately, the timing of the ambassador\u2019s visit was bad. A week before he was due to sail to Livorno, Fauconberg learned that the old Grand Duke, Ferdinando II, had been suddenly taken ill and there was little hope of his survival. The welcoming committee that had met in Livorno, seeing that the ambassador was delaying his arrival, began to suspect that he had very sensibly decided on a change of plan and was already on his way to Venice. They had not factored in the Englishman\u2019s determination: against all expectations, in the early afternoon of 26 May 1670, Fauconberg arrived on board a Genoese galley.[CITATION-69] He found a town in mourning; three days earlier Ferdinando had died.Canon Bassetti, who had been specially sent to Livorno by Prince Cosimo, discreetly enquired whether Fauconberg was willing to put off the visit to Florence to a better time, but, finding him to be immoveable, asked him at least to wait for the funeral rites to be celebrated and to present himself at the Palazzo Pitti, giving up all public ceremony. The ambassador was not opposed to the idea of prolonging his stay in Livorno: he could get to know the consul and the Factory merchants better, listen to their complaints, and really understand the nature of the problems there.[CITATION-70] Disagreements with the Tuscan authorities were largely a result of divisions within the Factory itself. Dodington, the real political mind of the delegation, who enjoyed peppering his reports with learned Latin quotations, wrote that the discord was mainly engendered by envy, a sentiment entirely natural among those who share the same profession, and which on many occasions actually produces positive effects:. But among the English merchants of Livorno, envy gave rise not to healthy emulation, but to mortal enmity.[CITATION-71] Apparently, the political conflicts of the Interregnum were without any significant negative consequences, and, with the exception of one or two cases of long-standing resentment, it turned out that the true cause of the quarrelsomeness lay in the conflict of private interests and rivalries.Dodington had no doubt that the situation had deteriorated on account of the rivalry between the resident ambassador and the consul. In his view, appointing two representatives of the king where one would have sufficed had been a mistake, only serving to encourage insubordination and partisan bickering. The two characters involved were very different men, and heartily detested each other. Sir John Finch, the resident, belonged to one of the most illustrious families in England. Heneage Finch, his father, had been Speaker of the House of Commons, while his cousin, the earl of Winchilsea, was Attorney General and was shortly to be appointed Lord Chancellor. Sir John had not embarked on a diplomatic career by vocation, and would have preferred to continue his beloved medical studies. In 1649, he had moved to Italy with his inseparable companion Thomas Baines in order to specialise at the University of Padua; he had also established a relationship with the heirs of the Galileian tradition, who met at the, and had earned the trust and protection of the prince, and future cardinal, Leopoldo de\u2019 Medici, who in 1659 backed his appointment to the chair of anatomy at the University of Pisa. In 1665, when Charles II looked into the matter of establishing a diplomatic post in Florence, Sir John, with his prestigious ties, must have appeared the ideal candidate. He was a true, an erudite gentleman delighted by science and perfectly at ease in the court milieu.[CITATION-72] The temperament of his rival, the consul Thomas Clutterbuck, was entirely different, and the only thing the two men had in common was their age. The son of a Bristol apothecary, Clutterbuck had moved to Livorno around 1647 to engage in trade, and immediately made his mark as an ambitious and somewhat unscrupulous businessman. Unlike Sir John, who was unmarried and lived with his friend Baines, Clutterbuck had a wife and four children. In 1661, an important change occurred in his fortunes. Thanks to his political affiliations\u2014he enjoyed the protection of Sir Robert Southwell and of the Admiral William Penn\u2014the Royal Navy appointed him official supplier in the Mediterranean.[CITATION-73] When he arrived in London in 1669 asking to be appointed consul, Clutterbuck was arrested for debt, but a few months later he triumphed over all his enemies and returned to Livorno with a consular patent and a knighthood. Notwithstanding his reputation as a difficult man, and a chequered history as a businessman, the Navy Board appears to have fully appreciated Clutterbuck\u2019s efforts in Livorno to support logistically the Navy\u2019s growing activities in the region.No great insight is needed to see that Finch and Clutterbuck would never be on the same page. Dodington was initially inclined to show his sympathy for the consul. He believed Finch to be a courtier endowed with poor negotiating skills, and impeded by an excess of caution from successfully protecting the interests of king and nation. Clutterbuck, on the other hand, exuded authority, was used to conducting business and seemed a born negotiator.Fauconberg communicated his plan to Canon Bassetti: he would remain in Livorno until the morning of 2 June, so as to arrive at Palazzo Pitti to meet Cosimo no later than the 4th and stay only a few days. Unfortunately, on the eve of his departure, Fauconberg left his table with slight feelings of indigestion. He had already experienced some symptoms before his arrival in Livorno, and it soon emerged that he was truly unwell. Someone, possibly his host, the merchant Thomas Dethick, suggested an infallible remedy: why not pay a visit to the Celeb\u00ec? The Celeb\u00ec was an Armenian who had opened a Turkish bath in Livorno, and the Turkish bath was regarded as a proven health-promoting restorative.[CITATION-74] In the meantime, Sir John Finch was already in Florence; he had arrived a few days early to ensure everything was ready for the ambassador\u2019s arrival. But on Monday evening he received an urgent dispatch: everything was to be put off. Lord Fauconberg had been taken by \u2018a suddain violent distemper\u2019. He had left the baths and made his way home, unadvisedly \u2018leaving his biass expos\u2019d to the Ayre\u2019. The next morning he was in the grip of a most violent fever, and the doctor had ordered him to bed.[CITATION-75] The news was spread by the diplomatic network, regaling recipients with a few moments of humorous entertainment. The Venetian resident wrote to the Senato that Fauconberg had asked for it, as it was highly imprudent to leave the Turkish baths \u2018with his jupon open and his chest exposed\u2019, especially when \u2018a robust siroccal wind\u2019 was blowing.[CITATION-76] From Rome, Cardinal Leopoldo de\u2019 Medici, constantly updated on the goings-on in Tuscany by his secretary Panciatichi, observed with irony that it had been \u2018a very courteous attention on the part of the English ambassador to delay his arrival here [in Florence] for the respectful reason he indicates in his letter\u2019.[CITATION-77] But the most amused must undoubtedly have been the officials of the Grand Duchy, who had up to that moment worriedly exchanged news and comments on the arrival of this inconvenient visitor. The governor of Livorno, Antonio Serristori, had discovered that the Factory had compiled a list of grievances which the envoy would have been charged with voicing, and duly informed the Secretary of War, Count Ferdinando Bardi. English merchants, whom Serristori elsewhere in his correspondence had described as \u2018scatter-brained\u2019 (\u2018cervelli poco aggiustati\u2019), expected Fauconberg to complain \u2018of many and diverse pretend issues connected with public health and civil issues, in which ... we do our best to keep them satisfied, and it is not possible to do more\u2019.[CITATION-78] The Grand Duke\u2019s ministers were scarcely able to contain their indignation against this indiscreet guest, who had not only arrived at such an inopportune moment, but also felt entitled to voice complaints which, they felt, were entirely unjustified. It should be noted, however, that they must have been expert dissimulators, as the English had no inkling of the bad feelings towards them, and indeed, in their dispatches to the Secretary of State Lord Arlington, both Finch and Dodington declared themselves full of hope as to the outcome of the negotiations, and that a better time for them could not have been chosen:The Duke at present is but newly warme in his Government and pretends extraordinary affection to ye English, so that a Body of Articles might questionlesse be obtayned upon easy termes in this juncture, but if now omitted, I doubt whether another so favourable a one will be found.[CITATION-79] With his customary erudite wink, the Secretary glossed his statement with a couplet traditionally attributed to Dionisio Catone:,.[CITATION-80] Opportunity, described as being \u2018hairy in front\u2019, should be immediately taken; this would not have been possible without the death of the old Grand Duke. Fate had decreed that Fauconberg should negotiate with an inexpert prince, who only the year before had spent much time in England, had met Charles II and saw himself as a great friend of the English.[CITATION-81] The political manoeuvres with the Italian princes had been thus far planned so as to allow the envoy to deploy to his advantage the \u2018jealousy\u2019 of the Medici towards Carlo Emanuele II of Savoy, with whom, just a few months earlier, Finch himself had opened negotiations aimed at favouring English commerce. Those more experienced in matters of trade knew perfectly well that it was highly unlikely that English merchants would abandon Livorno in favour of Villafranca. It was nevertheless worthwhile to humour the commercial ambitions of the Duke of Savoy, at the very least as leverage in Tuscany. This was a trump card Dodington was ready to play, and which led him to state: \u2018now is the time to obtayne good conditions for trade at Livorno\u2019.[CITATION-82] In the meantime, the ambassador was feeling better and set off for Florence. As previously agreed, he travelledand entered the Palazzo Pitti by a secondary entrance. He succeeded, nevertheless, in making something of a statement: \u2018First went twenty footmen, then his Ex[cellen]cy in the Dukes coach with Princeps Francesco, the Merg. Salviatti and Mr Sanderson his Ex[cellen]cies nephew. In the next coach followed the Pages who were six. Then came six coaches each carryng four Gentlemen of his Ex[cellen]cies retinue and last of all the Consul of Livorno in his coach attended by six marchants of the Factory in their own several coaches with their attendants all in mourning and last by his Ex[cellen]cies baggage carryed by six large mulos with their black velvet sumpters clothes and adornements of silver\u2019.[CITATION-83] Cosimo received him on the lowest of the steps leading up to the palazzo, led him to his rooms and accepted his condolences, with Dodington acting as interpreter\u2014although Fauconberg understood Italian \u2018very well\u2019, so much so that he conversed with the prince \u2018about a quarter of an hower in that language\u2019, before Cosimo retired.[CITATION-84] Having been able to confer privately with Cosimo, Fauconberg summoned Finch to give him his instructions and to discuss the Factory\u2019s issues, such as the several quarrels between merchants which had ended up in Tuscan courts.[CITATION-85] There was also the issue of the \u2018halfe consolage\u2019, which Clutterbuck demanded from all English ships that dropped anchor in Livorno, even if they did not unload.[CITATION-86] This problem had emerged with the opening of hostilities between Algiers and England. English merchant ships sailing the Mediterranean had then prudently adopted the custom of assembling in Livorno so that they might complete their voyage under the protection of the Royal Navy, but they were not necessarily paying the relevant consular dues, and Clutterbuck complained about it.Another matter on the table was the Factory\u2019s list of grievances, drawn up as a petition; but Fauconberg had not yet spoken of this to Cosimo, and chose, at least for the time being, not to tell Finch about it either. He did, however, ask his opinion about the question of an Anglican minister to be based in Livorno. The new Grand Duke, as was largely to be expected, had stated that he would adhere to the the \u2018ancient principles\u2019, and declared that a chaplain would be tolerated in Livorno as long as there were no scandals or complaints from Rome. Certain that he had got his way, Fauconberg had already planned to give the position to his personal chaplain, the Reverend William Durham, who was to follow him to Venice and then return to Livorno to take up his pastoral duties. Finch knew well that promises and guarantees made by Tuscany in religious affairs were not worth much, and that protests would certainly be forthcoming from Rome. Surprised at Fauconberg\u2019s ingenuousness, the resident enquired as to what was to be done \u2018in case the G. Duke should tell me that complaints were so high from Rome that He could not suffer him any longer\u2019. Fauconberg was unable to answer; he only left him a declaration, written in his own hand, in which were set out the commitments verbally undertaken by the Grand Duke.[CITATION-87] It was a rather paltry success, but what could have been expected? The envoy had spent only three days in Florence, from Saturday to Wednesday after lunch, \u2018too small a time for businesse\u2019. Sir John realised that the negotiation had reached no definitive results, but it is unclear whether he had any inkling of the tough nut he would shortly have to crack. Fauconberg suddenly pulled out a piece of paper; it was the Factory petition. There had been no time to discuss it with Cosimo: who would have to attend to it now?Finally, on 8 July, Fauconberg was in front of the Senato.[CITATION-88] Notwithstanding his knowledge of Italian, he spoke in English, something duly registered by the Venetian clerks.[CITATION-89] Fauconberg started by congratulating the Republic on peace with the Porte, hinting at unfinished business between the Venetians and Ottomans, and stating how King Charles had granted him authority as his plenipotentiary minister to act as intermediary between the two.[CITATION-90] English governments, both during the Commonwealth and after the Restoration, had walked an increasingly fine line between the belligerents. While formally neutral, English merchants active in the Mediterranean had provided logistical maritime support to both parties. Fauconberg, though, felt the need to open his mission by offering an apologetic explanation for the lack of more substantive support:At present I shall also add that If the King my Lord has sent some small help, as did other Princes, this was due to the need of the trade which is handled by his subjects in the [Ottoman] empire\u2019s territories, as their lives could be in grave danger, and ruin could fall on many.[CITATION-91] The delay in sending an ambassador to Venice was thus explained by the need to protect English subjects active in the Ottoman empire and their substantial economic interests.[CITATION-92] Behind the fairly traditional claim of \u2018protection\u2019 lay also the increasing English effort to exert jurisdiction effectively over subjects wherever they were active. In an age of the expansion of English commercial interests, the state was taking a more interventionist approach towards this issue. Politically, Fauconberg\u2019s primary objective was to find a way to promote Charles as the natural intermediator in the region. This clear attempt at establishing England as a strong player in the Mediterranean required a two-pronged strategy: on one hand, an aggressive naval policy towards Algiers, formally a vassal state of the Ottomans; on the other, the diplomatic offer of mediation between two established powers embroiled in delicate negotiations to achieve peace after a long conflict. Building on the long-standing commercial relationship established with both Venice and the Ottomans, and given that these relations had survived the quarter-century-long War of Candia, this strategy had considerable potential.[CITATION-93] Many things had changed since the beginning of the century, but in everyday bilateral relations, the economic element remained the predominant concern.[CITATION-94] Frankly, there was nothing new in the issues which Fauconberg had been instructed to discuss in Venice. First was trade with Venice itself. English merchants in Venice had long complained about the constraints they suffered in the dried fish () trade. The first memorandum presented by Fauconberg restated the requests they had repeatedly made over the previous thirty years, all related to demanding the relaxation of sales restrictions in Venice, and the lowering of customs there.[CITATION-95] As in Florence, Fauconberg also introduced a series of individual cases of merchants with active litigation in various Venetian courts of justice, or with outstanding credits or debits with the local government.[CITATION-96] The consul, George Hayles, was himself involved in a couple of long-standing cases; a particularly complex one involving the Venetian subject Rocco Fustinoni had also been the subject of a letter sent by Charles II directly to the Doge in early 1670.[CITATION-97] The second\u2014and far heftier\u2014memorandum concerned the English presence in the Stato da Mar. The relationship between English merchants and the population of the Ionian Islands, the centre of the currant trade, was deteriorating. The English complaints mirrored those which had been presented to the Collegio in 1636: accusations of malfeasance on the part of the local customs farmers, irregularities and corruption in the official scales, problems in loading ships, and deliberate and continual delays aimed at eliciting bribes.[CITATION-98] Nothing appeared to have changed since then in the islands and, acknowledging this, Fauconberg added that in recent times there had been no official complaints on account of the \u2018English disturbances\u2019 and the ongoing Candia war.[CITATION-99] The currant trade was at the centre of all complaints, whether these concerned its practical organisation or the duties the Venetian government had imposed on it. Once more Fauconberg highlighted how the English were just about the only buyers of this \u2018non necessary merchandise, [which is paid for] with silver and gold, as there is no real market for other goods in the islands\u2019.[CITATION-100] But, then again, these veiled threats had been made several times before, and English merchants were still in the islands as the main buyers, the Senato knowing well that continued English demand for currants in effect guaranteed their presence. So the usual diplomatic dance ensued: the Collegio replied to Fauconberg that they had done much to facilitate English trade in the islands, and were looking forward to doing more to help them.[CITATION-101] This was a bare-faced lie, as for the past century all Venetian activities in this regard had been pursued with the goal of either regaining control of that trade, or taxing it as much as possible.If these \u2018mercantile matters\u2019 were indeed long-standing, a more recent development was that English merchants had become the target of physical violence in the islands, and this development was a genuine shared concern for the Senato and Fauconberg. The latter pushed for the punishment of the murderers of the consul at Zante, Clement Harby, and for the acceptance of his nephew Thomas in his post.[CITATION-102] The underlying issue was the length of time it took both for the trial proceedings and for the subsequent settlements. English merchants in Venice did not enjoy the privilege of summary procedure in civil trials; this would be bestowed upon them only in 1698.[CITATION-103] This was certainly an issue, but the problem ran deeper than this, as the many levels of judicial appeals which were available in Venice had always irked them. What the Republic\u2019s authorities considered a guarantee of administering proper justice was seen by the English as lack of efficiency.Fauconberg strongly conveyed that the length of these trials, whether dealing with civil or criminal proceedings, was increasingly resented by his fellow countrymen.[CITATION-104] A growing intolerance for the length of civil trials in particular was palpable, but it is worth noting that even though the issue was as relevant in Venice as in Tuscany, and had formed part of Fauconberg\u2019s actual negotiation in Florence, it did not really emerge as powerfully in Venice. A similar pattern is observable in regard to litigation concerning insurances and averages, something also discussed by Fauconberg during his stay in Genoa, apparently to no avail there either.[CITATION-105] Ambassador Valier in Florence assured the Collegio that he would pursue the matter further so as to garner more details on how these issues were being handled in Tuscany, but his later dispatches are silent on this matter.[CITATION-106] Most probably, silence descended because of the sheer structural scale of these problems in Venice, which did not make them a suitable topic for negotiation within an extraordinary mission.[CITATION-107] Frustration was tangibly increasing on both sides, and the second half of August was spent conducting meetings, with great movement of papers between various governmental offices, but with no practical result to bring back to London.[CITATION-108] The Venetians were not simply dithering. On 23 August, two days after Fauconberg had presented the memorandum about the situation in the Ionian Islands, the Senato asked the Cinque Savi alla Mercanzia and the Provveditore Generale da Mar to provide their own assessments about the issues raised.[CITATION-109] The reply of Antonio Bernardo, Procuratore di San Marco and Provveditore Generale da Mar with authority of Capitano Generale da Mar, arrived a few months afterwards.[CITATION-110] His advice was to satisfy most of the English requests\u2014an opinion shared by some of his predecessors, such as the Provveditore Generale delle Isole Francesco Mocenigo, who had issued proclamations along these lines already in 1662. Bernardo recommended that these be effectively implemented, and highlighted how the issue of reining in the financial abuses of the local authorities was of strategic importance to the Venetian state at large.[CITATION-111] Fauconberg, though, did not wait for these answers to arrive, and on 5 September formally took his leave of the Collegio, among mutual expression of loyal friendship and regret that his time in Venice had been so short.[CITATION-112] If the Grand Tour of mercantilism had not achieved its political and economic aims, its cultural side was thriving: frustrated by the slow Venetian governmental system, Fauconberg channelled his energies into shopping. In Florence, probably with the support of Finch, he had acquired four bronzes by Giambologna. In Venice he bought a Venus by Titian, a Magdalene and \u2018two long narrow pictures of Giorgion\u2019, three pictures by Tintoretto, \u2018one great Bersheba of Palma Junior\u2019, and paintings by Jacopo Bassano, Dosso Dossi, Veronese and Rembrandt.[CITATION-113] Of the two tasks Lord Fauconberg had left in his hands, it was the Factory petition that irritated Finch more. He had neither been consulted about its contents, nor had he actually seen it until after he had received orders to attend to it. Agreeing to the requests in the petition, moreover, would have meant the Grand Duke accepting a reduction in his revenue, for which the English were offering no compensation. Such conditions made negotiations difficult. Also to be taken into account was the fact that the wishes of the Livorno commissioners and factors might not meet with the approval of clients and employers in London; this was something Sir John suspected to be the case and believed should be verified. For all these reasons, Finch would have liked to obtain a clear mandate from the king, and as precise instructions as possible. In a long letter to Arlington, Finch repeatedly mentioned his personal inadequacy and his embarrassment at having to put himself to the test in what promised to be an intense conversation with Cosimo on vile matters of money: \u2018I cannot well enter\u2019\u2014he wrote\u2014\u2018into severe expostulations with his H[ighn]esse which are by comparing interest with interest, and upon that to give him an assault by telling him that that He will loose more withdrawing his assent then by giving it\u2019.[CITATION-114] Dodington had been right in his judgement: John Finch was not naturally gifted with the skill of a negotiator. Finally, however, he determined \u2018to act upon all emergency\u2019s that may concern his Majesty\u2019s interest with ye G. Duke in the same manner as if I had received new credentials\u2019. This was because Arlington promised that this would be the last time, that his letter of leave was ready, and that he would soon be back in England.[CITATION-115] The merchants\u2019 requests require some explanation. Apart from denouncing a number of administrative malfunctions, the Factory demanded changes in the sanitary and customs regulations; in addition, the factors wanted the justice system to be both faster in giving its rulings and less heavy-handed in granting writs of execution.[CITATION-116] On the issue of quarantine, according to the Factory, the laws of Livorno were exceedingly rigorous. All goods coming from England, even those that could provide a clean bill of health, ended up quarantined, while goods from infected areas were subject to extremely onerous increases of duty, especially if compared to Genoa and Marseilles. The Factory, therefore, asked that permission should be given for the goods coming from England \u2018bringing Bills of health \u2026 to come directly on shoare without goeing to Lazaretto or making Quarantine\u2019, as \u2018it hath heertofore binn practised\u2019.[CITATION-117] The increased strictness of precautionary measures had been put in place during the London plague of 1665\u20136 and never suspended, despite the fact that the danger had passed.Another trigger of dissatisfaction was the slowness of justice. It was unacceptable, the merchants felt, to be \u2018kept six to seven yeares, out of our monies by our debtors\u2019, as all too often happened. This was a very serious problem, for which solutions had to be found as soon as possible, because the slowness of legal processes was unfortunately paralleled by a \u2018zealous nonchalance\u2019 in making arrests. According to the Factory, prison was not always necessary to protect the interests of the treasury and creditors: \u2018caution may be used in law as may respect the credit of marchant and noe publick affront be done him\u2019.[CITATION-118] The most interesting set of criticisms, which would in fact contribute to determining the future of the port of Livorno, were those directed against the customs administration. The bans which particularly damaged wool importation were strongly contested by the Factory, on the basis of the principle of reciprocity: \u2018wee may have a freedome of vent in all his High[ne]ss dominions for all ye comodities of his Mayesties dominions and plantations, as well as their silkes have in England\u2019.[CITATION-119] The Factory unanimously approved this request. Opinions were divided when it came to solutions to the malfunctioning of the, the central mechanism on which the free port pivoted. The customs law signed by Cosimo I in 1566 had established an institutionalised control system aimed at ensuring two forms of taxation: the first was a very low tax called stallage, imposed ongoods arriving by sea, which were to be deposited in the customs warehouses. The other tax, the most significant revenue for the port system, affected transactions. This is best described as a \u2018broker\u2019s commission\u2019\u2014the Medici were, after all, merchant princes. The agreement they had with international commercial operators might be described as follows: bring your goods into our free port; we will undertake to safeguard them in exchange for a reasonable recompense, and should you manage to sell them, and only in that case, you must pay duty on them; otherwise you are free to re-export them wherever you may please. This agreement originally had a sell-by date, as it were: after two years, unsold and unre-exported goods became once more subject to taxation, although facilitations and deferred payments were conceded. Over time, through constant tweaking, Ferdinando I made it perpetual, cancelling the two-year limit, but only for goods arriving and departing by the sea route.For a fiscal system such as this to function properly, it was necessary for the administration to be perfectly informed about all the commercial transactions that took place in Livorno, and to this end a great book was kept in the Customs Office in which merchants and mediators were obliged to write down all the contracts into which they entered. The system, however, had been conceived in a time when the number of market operators was very small; with the rapid and massive increase in business around the middle of the seventeenth century, it was no longer easy to control. Now the scourge most to be feared was tax evasion, to which the authorities responded by burying all transactions under such an intolerable weight of bureaucracy that sticking to the rules became an increasingly rare virtue and abuses and corruption flourished.[CITATION-120] To remedy these failings in the system, the majority of Factory members thought it would be sufficient to remind the customs officers of their duties and to introduce minimal corrective measures to the tariffs. The accountants should keep the books updated, so that \u2018every man at his pleasure may know how his account stand with them. And yt after adjustment made heere [in Livorno] there be no farther demands made on us, eyther at Pisa, or any place else, nor on any pretence whatsoever for which may be acted above two years at most\u2019.[CITATION-121] Above all, it was necessary that there should be no objections as to the identity of the person indicated as owing the tax; that is to say, the buyer of the goods, who normally contracted to take upon himself the tax paid by the importer. Finally, the Factory merchants asked for the stallage tax to be lowered \u2018on our English goods, which on lead and some other comodities of small vallue is now extravagant\u2019.[CITATION-122] As may be seen, most of the merchants were asking for correctives that would have left the basic underpinnings of the system essentially unchanged. But six merchants, Clutterbuck among them, thought up a much more radical solution: \u2018Instaed [] of regulating the Custome it were more requisite to settle wholly ye stallage on goods at arrival, without paying for the Custome or ought else\u2019.[CITATION-123] They thought it necessary, in practice, to dismantle everything, and abolish the, maintaining only the collection of the stallage, which would be transformed into an import tax. It was a brave proposal, which the assembly of the Factory merchants did not dare to approve. It was, nevertheless, included in the original text of the petition as a minority motion, and later, possibly following pressure from the consul, it became part of the official document that Finch handed to the Grand Ducal authorities. Neither of the two proposals, as we shall see, had any immediate effect, but the idea of simplifying the system, by abandoning the idea of taxing transactions to focus on the movement and circulation of goods, began to make some inroads, so much so that it became the cornerstone on which Cosimo III\u2019s 1676 reform of the free port was based.[CITATION-124] The final point of the petition concerned the question of religious practice, but this had been removed from the document and the matter dropped as the Factory proved to have no real intention of following it up. Before leaving, Fauconberg had given orders to Clutterbuck to call a meeting to discuss the minister\u2019s living, but as soon as the matter of money was raised, the merchants\u2019 religious zeal cooled. Three of them declared outright that they would not pay and others brought up other issues, so that the plea for a minister was abandoned\u2014much to the satisfaction of the Tuscan authorities, who feared retaliation from Rome, and indeed without too much regret on the part of the Factory, where it was felt that such a concession would never actually be obtained. About thirty years later, during the reign of Queen Anne, Cosimo III granted the request, but it was the Navy\u2019s gunboats that were responsible for winning this particular battle.[CITATION-125] Fauconberg, in his report to the king, predicted that Finch\u2019s negotiation would have a positive outcome for exactly the same reasons Dodington had previously underscored in his letters to Arlington: the new Grand Duke seemed \u2018well inclined to your Majesty\u2019s person and people in regard of his knowledge both of the one and the other\u2019; also, \u2018hee is jealous, least the Duke of Savoy by his franck procedure in his treaty should draw away your merchants to Villa Franca, a place as well seated and adapted for trade as any port of Italy\u2019.[CITATION-126] The oldadage still served to guide the behaviour of the English towards the Italian princes. \u2018All the princes and states of Italy who border on the sea\u2019, stated Fauconberg, \u2018are contriveing, \u00e0 l\u2019of each other, which of them shall draw more pigeons to his dove coate; soe that your Majesty may prevaile on this occasion to obtayne any thing in reason which you can propose\u2019.[CITATION-127] When Clutterbuck found out that John Finch balked at the idea of supporting the requests of the Factory, he began a systematic campaign to discredit him. He wrote to Fauconberg to express his indignation against Sir John, who, he suggested, had raised the non-existent problem of a possible conflict of interests between the London trading houses and the Livorno factors with the sole purpose of evading the duties of his office. Clutterbuck suspected that Finch was being obstructive because the Factory had refused to insert in the petition the request for \u2018a liberty of goeing to Law a fresh in England or any other country, when there hath binn a final decision heere purchased by many yeares vexations and expensive suits\u2019.[CITATION-128] The idea that a judgment passed in Tuscany could be appealed in a foreign tribunal was unacceptable from the Tuscan point of view; nevertheless, the mere fact that this issue was being aired implicitly gave the lie to what Clutterbuck had been saying: there were indeed constant quarrels between the London clients and the commissioners of the free port, as was proved by the frequent legal disputes.In order to appease the English consuls, who complained they had no instruments to make the English masters pay consulage, the Tuscan authorities had delegated to them the authority to collect the anchorage tax and the task of issuing licences on behalf of the health authorities. But ever since the consulate had been in Clutterbuck\u2019s hands, the anchorage tax revenues had no longer arrived in the coffers of the Grand Duchy. All attempts to \u2018make him attend to his duty, by reasonably explaining to him that he is mistaken in not wanting to pay out what rightly belongs in part to the Most Serene Lord and in part to other individuals\u2019 had failed.[CITATION-129] Two embarrassing situations now occurred, which complicated the negotiations. Finch had to deal with them and ask the Grand Duke for explanations. This time, the bone of contention was two verdicts passed by the Tuscan courts, one regarding the protest of a bill and the other a claim for \u2018average adjustment\u2019. The first was an emotive case that concerned a young supercargo called Jeremiah Armiger, who had been made a slave by Algerian corsairs and redeemed against his will by Jewish merchants\u2014at least according to his version of events. Because the Jews who had paid money on his behalf had not yet been repaid, the unfortunate Armiger had been served with an order of seizure.[CITATION-130] The other case was even more delicate from the diplomatic point of view, both because it involved some of the bedrock principles of maritime justice, and because it was raised by the Privy Council at the request of the lobby of London merchants, who for some time had been complaining about the regulation on \u2018averages\u2019 approved by the tribunal of the Consoli del Mare of Pisa.\u2014it may be useful to point out\u2014are the expenses for losses deliberately caused to the ship and cargo to avoid greater damage in case of an emergency, and which are apportioned between ship, freights and cargo. London merchants had for some time been complaining about the Pisan Consoli, accusing them of partiality towards ship masters, but it was the last straw when the court awarded a compensation of 1,800to the master of thefor the gunpowder employed to drive back the assault of an Algerian corsair.[CITATION-131] Following a specific request by King Charles, Sir John submitted a formal complaint to the Tuscan government, asking that English masters and sailors be forbidden to resort \u2018to the Pisan tribunals of the Consoli del Mare or another of Your Highness\u2019 courts, in order to present sea protests and claimon the goods carried by the ships, in the shape of whatever damages they claim to have sustained\u2019.[CITATION-132] In the autumn of 1670, following specific instructions from the Privy Council,[CITATION-133] which had examined and approved what had been done so far, Finch began to exert pressure on the Tuscan government to obtain an answer to all these proposals and reach an agreement. Cosimo, who had perhaps supposed he might disengage himself from the matter by exhausting his adversary, had realised by the beginning of 1671 that he could no longer tergiversate, and jolted his ministers into action. They hurriedly put together some information that would allow Secretary Marucelli to write an answer that was polite and ceremonial to a fault but disagreeable in its content: not one of the requests could be granted, and the reasons given were disconcertingly feeble.[CITATION-134] The secretary assured Finch that the Grand Duke would certainly intervene to remedy the various glitches reported in the system regarding the postal service, the public scales and the customs office, but he could not take any decision in matters of public health against the advice of the health authorities. One might have expected such a refusal to be justified by erudite explanations about the grave dangers of granting free circulation to English ships arriving from the west, albeit with a health clearance certificate, but the consultation of those eminent repositories of knowledge that formed the Magistrato di Sanit\u00e0 only produced the clipped remark: \u2018within our memory, the goods from the Ponent that came from beyond the Straits have never been exempted from quarantine\u2019.[CITATION-135] The truth is that the Tuscan authorities never had any intention of negotiating health regulations or in any way changing the \u2018ancient principles\u2019; especially not with the English, whom they eyed through the lens of a thousand prejudices, many of which were not entirely unfounded. English captains and sailors frequently misbehaved, regularly violated the Magistrate\u2019s instructions, bridled against orders, and were so obstinate that to keep them in line\u2014as Serristori believed\u2014violence was needed; it was therefore impossible to trust them. English sailors constituted a risk to public health for no other reason than simply because they were English. Tuscan health officers, if only to punish them, would not have yielded an inch of the rigour with which they were accustomed to treat them.[CITATION-136] On the other hand, none of the jurisdictional arguments could be faulted: the Tuscan response, at least on this point, was correct and impeccably argued, both because the legal counsellor (Emilio Luci, who had been charged with examining the requests made by the English, unlike the health officers and the customs ministers, did a very good job, and because it was frankly an easy question to answer. Cosimo could not \u2018allow the English merchants to be exempt from appearing before the court [of the Consoli del Mare], because that would have been equivalent to confounding and disrupting the good orders established to the end of good governance\u2019. It was necessary, moreover, to ensure that, in the issue of \u2018averages\u2019, \u2018different rules [should not be applied] for the English and for other merchants, since justice should be undivided and proceed in the same way for all, so that all things may settled without any favouritism, which would open the way to complaints and lamentations\u2019.[CITATION-137] Without indulging in any personal recrimination, Sir John replied to the weak justifications proffered by his Tuscan counterpart with a wealth of arguments, mostly expatiating on health policy issues, as was, after all to be expected. Finch was a physician, and he was scandalised by the fact that the Magistrato della Sanit\u00e0 had avoided entering into the fine details of the case.[CITATION-138] Sir John rebutted the hypocrisies of the Tuscans, bringing their prejudices out into the open, with many considerations of a medical and sanitary nature as well as politico-economic ones; without any possibility of convincing the Grand Duke to review his decisions, all he could do was savour a small drop of moral revenge. Nothing was left but to accept defeat and pack his bags. Before returning to England, however, he decided to settle matters with Clutterbuck, whose constant quarrels with his fellow countrymen and with the Tuscan authorities had contributed in no small measure to the failure of Finch\u2019s negotiation. The opportunity to deliver the final blow that would (he hoped) get rid of Clutterbuck, once and for all, presented itself shortly before his journey back to England. Having been informed of the imminent arrival in Livorno of the Grand Duke, Clutterbuck had refused to tender him the respects of his nation, and the Factory had therefore been obliged to entrust this task to Charles Longland. Finch saw his chance: he immediately wrote to Lord Arlington to report this final unacceptable impertinence on the part of the consul and asked for his removal from office.[CITATION-139] Clutterbuck tried to fend off the blow by asking for the help of those who had hitherto supported him\u2014among others, John Dodington, who had remained in Venice as resident. Without being asked to do so, Dodington wrote Arlington a long letter on the Livorno question, confirming his personal faith in Clutterbuck, and attributing the discord to the lack of financial remuneration sufficient for the consul to maintain the dignity of his post without getting embroiled in matters of trade. Dodington was not unaware of the discontent in the Factory; he knew that there was no love lost between Clutterbuck and the other English merchants, but he believed that tensions and disagreements were inevitable and would have existed with any other consul in his place:As to that of his being Consul, the marchants and Comanders of shipps trading there are only concerned in it, and they I conceive, are not only unsatisfied with him, But will continualy bee soe with any one that lives amongst them, with that qualification, espetially if ever he had formerly binn a trader and lived amongst them, But most of all, if during such trading, he should have had the misfortune to be behind hand with the world, as the saying is. All marchants have a constant envie towards one another which is not very hurtfull, But towards an unfortunate Trader, who after wards is promoted to a Consolate, and consequentely (as the place is now reputed) to a condition somewhat clawed above theirs, they retayne a scorn, which produceth very great disorders, and sometimes public ones, which are pregiuditial to private men, and mischievous to Trade in general.[CITATION-140] In an ideal situation there should have been appointed \u2018a man of some Garb, and one who may carry some Authority with him\u2019, someone who already occupied a respectable position, and who could manage public affairs with dignity and settle with grace and fairness the quarrels of those under his responsibility. Unfortunately, the post of consul was not adequately remunerated, and it was therefore inevitable that one would have to appoint some merchant, who then ended up suspected of putting his private interests above those of his office. It became therefore necessary \u2018to make these places more desirable, which is to be done, by encreating [] the proffites and incomes of them\u2019. In order to maintain the other consular offices in the Levant, such as those at Alexandria, Cyprus, Aleppo and Rosetta, substantial public funding had been made available, and, Dodington believed, it would be appropriate to do the same for Livorno, or at the very least to supplement the revenues from the consulate with additional income. To condemn consuls \u2018to their pristine poverty and abiect condition\u2019 was not a good policy, especially if they were to be officials who \u2018depend on the King, have Authority amongst marchants and some credite with the Governers, where they reside\u2019.[CITATION-141] At one level, it is tempting to judge Fauconberg\u2019s mission as a failure. None of the issues which formed part of his agenda came to a successful conclusion. Charles\u2019s ambitions to mediate between Venice and the Ottoman Empire did not materialise. In 1667, mediation between Spain and Portugal had delivered ample commercial privileges, but this time the English offer was politely ignored. The messy state of affairs characterising the English commercial community in Livorno remained unchanged; the long-standing grievances with Venice were not solved; Villafranca, as all the players knew from the beginning, proved to be a non-starter. Customs were not lowered, trade did not become frictionless, freedom of religious practice remained limited.At the same time, it is difficult not to see this episode as embodying a real instance of inter-cultural discourse. Too often, this rubric is employed exclusively for the relationship between \u2018Europe\u2019 and the \u2018rest of the world\u2019, assuming the existence of a level of uniformity in intra-European political and economic activities which emerged only at a far later period.[CITATION-142] It is not our intention to question the economic decline of Italian states and the growing strength of England. However, one cannot but note how Italian diplomatic culture and processes were still substantially superior to their English counterparts. Compared to the efficient professionalism displayed by all Italian diplomats involved in this mission, the English appear distinctively amateurish: Fauconberg did not have the necessary local knowledge to properly negotiate, Finch was unsuited to deal with commercial matters, Clutterbuck hamstrung by his own conflicts of interest. Those \u2018second or third rate Princes\u2019 proved capable of gathering and utilising information in a far more efficient way, and ultimately to co-operate to deflect English pressure and attempts to \u2018divide and rule\u2019 them. Caroline diplomacy lacked the efficiency and co-ordination to achieve its aims. From a more strictly \u2018political/diplomatic\u2019 perspective, there appears to have been a general feeling, shared across the major European courts, that the English had lost the art of \u2018negotiating\u2019.[CITATION-143] The episode of the badly worded credentials, which Dodington gently highlighted to Arlington, is a clear example of such clumsiness.However, the real root of the English problem lay in those different approaches to achieving that aspiration to a positive balance of trade which were mentioned at the beginning of this essay. Charles II had not managed to create the harmony between those supporting monopolistic companies (such as the Levant Company) and the free traders active in Livorno that was needed to support successful diplomatic missions. The multiplicity of interests behind the commercial expansion of England, as they emerged during Fauconberg\u2019s embassy, had laid bare that contrast between \u2018private\u2019 and \u2018public\u2019 interests which condemned negotiations to failure. Dodington points us in the right direction in his discussion of the underlying problems of selecting\u2014and supporting\u2014the state-controlled form of consular network which was emerging in the period. Fauconberg\u2019s mission is an exemplification of one of the central points made by Phillip Stern and Charles Wennerlind about state-centred mercantilism: \u2018certainly many early modern thinkers posited a mutually dependent relationship between merchants and political institutions, and wrote about the role commerce played in state power. However, the authority and legitimacy of that state to follow through on such prescriptions, and to regulate and manage commerce and economic life, was often both aspirational and restricted\u2019.[CITATION-144] John Dodington, who had acted as secretary and administrative factotum during Fauconberg\u2019s mission, remained in Venice on his departure as \u2018secretary of legation\u2019 and \u2018resident\u2019, as we have noted. His status was lower than that of a \u2018proper\u2019 ambassador, and his credentials were tightly focused on trying to solve issues in the Anglo-Venetian commercial relationship. Venice seemed to have lost its primacy in England\u2019s Italian and Mediterranean affairs.[CITATION-145] Yet in the following months a more bullish attitude emerged strongly in diplomatic discourse towards the Republic, and English naval ambitions in the Mediterranean were openly used as a bargaining tool to achieve a satisfactory solution to the various pending issues. Only a couple of weeks after Fauconberg\u2019s departure, Dodington communicated to the Collegio that it was not becoming that:the King, who wrote about this Business, and who sent his Ambassador here for this purpose, would not be satisfied, when he has the merit of keeping his fleet in the Mediterranean for the security of all Italy, and also the benefit of this Nation. And I give you my word that the King is resolute to send such a force next year in these seas, that they shall be everywhere, thus the Barbary corsairs will not dare venture out of their ports, not even with a small vessel. And the King does not ask from Italy and the Most Serene Republic anything more that satisfaction in these small matters, and not receiving it, he could retire his fleet, which will be a great damage.[CITATION-146] A few months later, in January 1671, the same argument was advanced by Finch in Florence, in a letter to Panciatichi. Discussing the ongoing problems in the administration of justice in Tuscany, Finch directly connected the legal vicissitudes of Jeremiah Armiger with Charles\u2019s wider ambitions of subduing Algiers \u2018for the benefitt not onely of His own Subiects but of all Christendome also\u2019. Finch, with a somewhat petulant tone, expressed his surprise at seeing \u2018those advantages which his sword has by the Divine benediction gott against ye Infidells, to be diminish\u2019d and weaken\u2019d by the Gown in the Sentences of ye Tribunalls of a Christian Prince\u2019.[CITATION-147] English diplomatic discourse was not just openly and strongly displaying a growing impatience with the slow and tortuous administration of justice in Tuscany and Venice, but was now declaring this to be evidence of a lack of gratitude on the part of the two governments towards the \u2018selfless\u2019 English naval policy of policing the Mediterranean for the greater good of \u2018Christendome\u2019. Up until this point the real effectiveness of English naval policing had been questionable, but in May 1671 Spragge\u2019s succesfull incursion at Algiers would finally bring down the local regime and set English Mediterranean policy in a new direction. Fauconberg\u2019s mission should be considered the last attempt at supporting England\u2019s growing commercial hegemony in the region purely through traditional diplomatic activities. Thereafter, the mercantilist Grand Tour approach was over, and a new form of international relationship was taking shape. The balance of trade was still an important part of it, but state-controlled armed fleets were entering the stage."

    "text": "This article investigates a sexual scandal that rocked the English Catholic Church in the Victorian era. Though forgotten today, Monsignor Thomas John Capel was one of the most famous clerics in the Victorian Church. His career fell into turmoil when, in 1879, Cardinal Henry Edward Manning launched a diocesan commission to investigate charges of sexual misconduct involving three women. Drawing on a series of rich and as yet unexplored archival sources, the article charts the career of Thomas Capel and assesses the nature, aims and outcomes of the Church-run inquiry into his conduct. Through an analysis of the actions not just of Capel but of Church authorities both in Westminster and in Rome, we gain a revealing window onto sexual scandal and the Church\u2019s response to it in the nineteenth century.In 1879 the Catholic Church in England was embroiled in a sexual scandal involving one of its most famous clerics. Though forgotten today, Monsignor Thomas John Capel (1836\u20131911) was a star of the Victorian church. A charismatic preacher and tireless networker, Capel dazzled English society in the 1870s, winning a string of converts from the Protestant elite, sparring in polemical bouts with Anglican divines as well as with Prime Minister William Gladstone, and appearing in countless press profiles. When the bishops appointed him rector of one of their flagship initiatives, the Catholic University in Kensington, his rise seemed unstoppable. Capel\u2019s career, however, was soon in turmoil. Financial mismanagement of the university prompted the bishops to demand his resignation in 1878. The following year, a Diocesan Commission began investigating serious charges of sexual misconduct involving three women. For the next four years Capel would fight to save his career and reputation, a fight that pitted him against one of the titans of the Victorian Catholic Church, Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, and which reached as far as Rome.A sexual scandal entangling a popular cleric along with an eminent Cardinal as well as a series of figures in the Vatican would seem an obvious target of scholarly interest. Yet historians have either ignored or merely sketched the outlines of the story. No biographer has tackled Capel\u2019s life and career. Historians of English Catholicism mention his disastrous tenure as rector of the Catholic University, but their focus is on financial ineptitude rather than sexual turpitude. J. Derek Holmes refers to \u2018rumours\u2019 of a \u2018liaison with a young woman\u2019, before dismissing them with the comment that \u2018the number and seriousness of the incidents were probably exaggerated\u2019.[CITATION-1] The eminent scholar Edward Norman unearthed part of the story in Manning\u2019s correspondence with his friend Bishop William Clifford, but could only furnish vague references to immorality.[CITATION-2] Recent works have done little better. Theentry on Capel mentions \u2018a charge of misconduct, involving young women\u2019.[CITATION-3] More detail appears in Tom Horwood\u2019s 2003 account of the demise of the Catholic University. Yet even here, Capel\u2019s sexual misdeeds are a minor element in a larger story of opposition to the project on the part of factions within the Church.[CITATION-4] Remarkably, the fullest account of the Capel scandal dates from the Victorian era. In writing his 1895, Edmund Sheridan Purcell enjoyed unfiltered access to his subject\u2019s correspondence and diaries. To the dismay of the Cardinal\u2019s friends, Purcell used this privileged position to paint Manning as ambitious, unscrupulous and hypocritical. When he turned to Capel, Purcell hinted at a lewd scandal, citing a note from Manning in which he blamed the University\u2019s collapse on its reputation for \u2018immorality\u2019, a reputation which stemmed from the behaviour of its rector.[CITATION-5] Correspondence between the diocese and the Vatican showed Manning\u2019s determination to discipline Capel.[CITATION-6] Yet the precise nature of the charges against him remained a mystery. Purcell was content to direct the curious or baffled reader to consult the files directly.[CITATION-7] Subsequent biographers offered brief and vague references only.[CITATION-8] The sensitive nature of the topic may partly explain this limited scholarship. But historians have been stymied as well by the difficulty of consulting key archives. One important collection, the archive of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (Inquisition) in Rome, opened fully to researchers only as recently as 1998. Another, the papers of Cardinal Manning, was for decades under the control of a French priest, Father Alphonse Chapeau (1905\u201389), at the University of Angers in France. To his great credit, Chapeau preserved the records, which were in an extremely poor state, and saved many from destruction. However, he was, by all accounts, a strict gatekeeper in relation to other scholars.[CITATION-9] Only in 2014, when the Westminster Diocesan Archives (WDA) obtained them, did the bulk of the Manning papers become accessible to researchers.[CITATION-10] The third and most revealing collection, a series of files relating directly to Capel, had already been acquired by the WDA before that date. But the problem for historians was that until 2009 they were not properly sorted and listed, and their contents therefore remained largely unknown.[CITATION-11] Drawing on the abundant and now accessible records in both Westminster and Rome, this article gives the first detailed account of the downfall of one of the most celebrated clerics in the Victorian age. The significance of this story goes well beyond the fame of its key protagonists or its reverberations within the English Catholic Church. More than this, it opens a window onto a subject that we know little about: clerical sexual scandal in the nineteenth century and the Church\u2019s strategies for dealing with it. When historians of the modern era have turned their attention to immorality in the priesthood, their focus has been on representations. The lecherous priest was a stock figure in an anti-Catholic literature which, ranging from lewd pamphlets to high-minded works of fiction, imagined the confessional and convent as dark spaces filled with illicit eroticism.[CITATION-12] Such tales served a range of cultural purposes, from allowing high-minded readers to indulge in voyeurism to whipping up hostility to the Church and throwing into relief the virtues of the Protestant home. The aggressive priests who roamed the pages of the popular stories of escaped nuns were a stark warning to all young women of the perils of straying from the domestic sphere.[CITATION-13] What historians have largely failed to do is to go beyond representations and to dig into the archives to find cases of priests who broke their vow of chastity and were subject to disciplinary processes.[CITATION-14] In contrast, historians of the medieval and early modern periods have unearthed many such cases. The phenomenon of clerical concubinage across Europe has been extensively studied.[CITATION-15] Drawing on the records of the Spanish Inquisition, Stephen Haliczer details cases of sexual misconduct on the part of confessors towards their female penitents.[CITATION-16] Irene Fosi has investigated how the justice system of the papal states in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries policed deviant sexual behaviour among clerics.[CITATION-17] These scholars note that such behaviour continued to be recorded long after the Council of Trent, which forcefully restated the rule of celibacy while introducing a series of reforms, such as the enclosure of convents, to encourage sexual discipline. Priests in eighteenth-century France regularly appeared before church tribunals after being denounced by parishioners.[CITATION-18] But historians of the nineteenth century have not followed the lead of these scholars. As a result, there remains much to discover about the nature of such cases, the attitude of Church leaders when confronted with accusations against priests, and the disciplinary processes which they set in motion.The case of Thomas Capel offers a precious insight into these questions, thanks to its rich archival base. The files, which detail a series of investigations into his conduct and character, are abundant and varied, encompassing private and official letters, witness testimony and tribunal reports. This trove of material opens up several lines of inquiry. First, we begin to see how a charismatic priest could engage in illicit behaviour for years without being unmasked. Secondly, the archives allow us to assess the response of Church leaders. Importantly, the records capture this response in the diocese of Westminster as well as in the Vatican, showing the often tense relationship between different layers of authority. Finally, we hear the voices of Capel\u2019s accusers. Admittedly, these voices do not come to us unfiltered. They were mediated through Church structures, whether the Diocesan Commission of investigation, or the religious repository that determined which documents to keep and which to discard. Nevertheless, the records allow us to piece together an account that goes beyond the perspective of the Church and which gives proper weight to the testimony of women who accused priests of breaking their vow of chastity.This article begins with a brief survey of the steep ascent of Thomas John Capel from relative obscurity to his appointment as rector of the Catholic University in Kensington. It then examines the first series of accusations concerning his sexual behaviour, and Cardinal Manning\u2019s response to them. The unfolding of the 1879 Diocesan Commission of Inquiry is the focus of the next section, followed by the dramatic intervention of the Vatican. The concluding section charts Capel\u2019s final disgrace as well as the traumatic consequences for the women at the heart of the scandal.The rise to fame of Thomas John Capel coincided with a flourishing period for the Catholic Church in England. Its resurgence began in the early decades of the century, with the 1829 Relief Act opening most public offices to Catholics. It accelerated after 1850 in response to two developments. First, the Vatican restored a full episcopal hierarchy, and secondly, an influx of working-class Irish immigrants triggered a wave of church- and school-building.[CITATION-19] In 1850, the number of Catholic churches and clergy in England and Wales stood at 587 and 788; twenty years later, they had grown to 1,151 and 1,528 respectively. The number of schools increased from 99 in 1850 to 1,484 in 1874.[CITATION-20] Another sign of renewal was the re-establishment of monastic orders such as the Dominicans and Franciscans. This was the era of famous Anglican converts. One of these was Cardinal John Henry Newman, who in 1852 proclaimed the Church to be enjoying its \u2018Second Spring\u2019, and who would become a widely admired writer and theologian.[CITATION-21] But it was another Anglican convert who put his stamp most firmly on the Church\u2019s direction. Henry Edward Manning enjoyed a meteoric rise after his conversion in 1851, becoming the second Archbishop of Westminster in 1865 and Cardinal a decade later. Manning consolidated the Church\u2019s shift towards Ultramontanism, emerging as one of the most zealous advocates of the doctrine of papal infallibility. At home, he worked tirelessly on a number of fronts: imposing a centralised and efficient administration, expanding the school network and aligning the Church with popular social reform, most famously when he mediated the London Dock Strike of 1889.[CITATION-22] He was also unswerving in his commitment to improving the quality of his clergy. The priest, as he set out in his book \u2018The Eternal Priesthood\u2019, should be a model of selflessness, purity and discipline.[CITATION-23] The Cardinal set the tone with his legendary personal austerity, eschewing the trappings of wealth, abstaining from alcohol and fulminating against the theatre. But this, combined with his authoritarian style, made him a distant and often abrasive figure, especially in contrast to the more genial Newman.[CITATION-24] Thomas John Capel came from a different mould. To begin with, he was not an Anglican convert but was born into the Catholic Church, a fact that he would deploy in his efforts to discredit his accusers. Nor did he enjoy the classical Oxbridge education of Newman and Manning. Instead, Capel trained as a teacher, obtaining his certificate from St Mary\u2019s Roman Catholic Teacher Training College, Brook Green, in 1853, before being ordained six years later. This was a humble start to a priestly career. But Capel exuded charm and this, allied to a keen eye for identifying men of influence, fuelled his ascent. By 1867 he was chaplain to Charles Scott Murray, a Conservative MP, and through him became close friends with John Patrick Crichton-Stuart, third marquess of Bute, who was one of the wealthiest members of the nobility.[CITATION-25] In 1868, having delivered a series of popular sermons at St Clement\u2019s Chapel in Oxford, Capel received Bute into the Church. The conversion of Bute shocked British society and sealed Capel\u2019s fame. A mark of his newfound notoriety was his appearance in Benjamin Disraeli\u2019s fictionalised account of the Bute affair,. An enormous hit upon its publication in 1870,tells the story of a Scottish aristocrat who is torn between Anglicanism and Roman-Catholicism. A cast of Catholics try to lure him into their faith, including the pompous Cardinal Grandison, Disraeli\u2019s barely concealed caricature of Manning. But it is the magnetic and devious Monsignore Catesby, a character that Disraeli admitted to have drawn directly from Capel, who embodies Catholicism at its most insidious and alluring.[CITATION-26] In the decade that followed, Capel\u2019s star continued to rise. In an age that valued oratory, he shone as a compelling public speaker, impressing all with his sheer energy as he criss-crossed the country lecturing on topics from materialism to confession and from women\u2019s rights to the art of Raphael. This popular appeal was matched by his extraordinary capacity to win over the social elite. In its series \u2018Men of the Day\u2019,labelled him \u2018the apostle of the genteel\u2019, noting his handsome features, easy charm and sheer likeability.[CITATION-27] His Sunday afternoon gatherings at his home in Kensington became famous for their eclectic cast of guests. They drew, as one paper wrote, \u2018clever people of both sexes, of all religions, and even of no religion\u2019.[CITATION-28] Many of these clever people wrote about their encounters with Capel in London\u2019s drawing rooms and private clubs. The editor of the satirical magazine, Shirley Brooks, found him \u2018delightful\u2019 and \u2018full of information\u2019.[CITATION-29] When the former President Ulysses S. Grant visited London on his world tour of 1877, Capel was the only non-American invited to a private dinner on Independence Day.[CITATION-30] Far from merely frivolous, this socialising brought the Catholic Church a crop of influential converts. Newspapers reported the details of his latest successes; \u2018his converts alone\u2019, one wrote, \u2018would fill the pro-Cathedral at Kensington\u2019.[CITATION-31] By the end of the decade, one Anglican writer could claim that Thomas John Capel was \u2018the most popular Catholic ecclesiastic in England\u2019, a man whose fame exceeded even that of Cardinal Manning.[CITATION-32] Far from resenting Capel\u2019s success, Manning entrusted him with the leadership of one of his most cherished initiatives. The Catholic University College in Kensington became a priority for Manning and the English and Welsh bishops once they had decided that Catholics should not be educated in Protestant institutions, a decision subsequently confirmed by Rome. Designed to cater to middle- and upper-class men between the ages of 17 and 22, the College would offer an education that aligned with Catholic principles, and was seen by Manning as the first step towards the establishment of a broad-based Catholic university system. It was, in other words, a critical endeavour, and it was a mark of Capel\u2019s standing that he seemed the obvious choice to lead it. Apart from his \u2018extraordinary energy\u2019, as one paper wrote, \u2018his personal influence with the wealthy Catholics is notoriously extensive and powerful\u2019.[CITATION-33] Capel was in place as rector when the opening term began in October 1874.The public image of a successful and devoted priest, however, concealed a troubling series of accusations. Well before the bishops appointed Capel as rector, Manning, the stickler for clerical standards, knew that he was under a cloud of serious allegations. In 1870, two American sisters complained to Manning that Capel \u2018acted with immodesty\u2019 towards one of them during their stay in Rome. Nor was this the only claim. In 1873 a French priest alleged that Capel had engaged in \u2018criminal intercourse\u2019 with a servant on one occasion as well as repeatedly with a governess over a period of three years. In response, Manning confronted Capel, who angrily denied all charges and threatened to sue the priest for defamation in civil court.[CITATION-34] The next charge came from much closer to home. In 1875, Manning received a letter from a 23-year-old woman named Mary Stourton. He would have recognised her family name. Mary\u2019s grandfather was a Catholic peer, the eighteenth Baron Stourton, who had been one of the most vocal advocates of Catholic emancipation; her father, William, was the younger brother of the nineteenth baron. She began by begging Manning to keep her identity secret, for fear that Capel might turn her family against her. Then she recounted the painful story of her life. Miserable at her family home, she had run away with a married man. She made this admission fully conscious that she had been \u2018weak and very wicked\u2019, but hopeful that Manning would nevertheless believe her story. Abandoned by the man, and cut off from friends and family, she came to the attention of the famous Monsignor Capel. At first he posed as her protector, promising to soothe relations with her family. What happened next, she wrote, was \u2018hard to write\u2019. Her priest and protector set out \u2018deliberately\u2019 and in a \u2018heartless way\u2019 to \u2018ruin me still more\u2019. Such was his power over her that she \u2018dared not resist him\u2019 as he became a regular evening visitor to her home. What she now desired above all was to see him unmasked. Capel, she wrote with disgust, was revered for his good works and piety. Her own aunt told her she was blessed to have such a friend. It would \u2018drive me mad,\u2019 Stourton wrote, \u2018to think that such numbers of really good people should be so deluded as to look on him as they do\u2019.[CITATION-35] In assessing Manning\u2019s response, the first point to consider is that church authorities were hardly blind to the possibility that priests might break their vow of chastity. The first four provincial synods after the 1850 restoration laid down safeguards to protect priests against erotic temptation. Unsupervised contact with young women was to be avoided as far as possible. Confessors were instructed to hear female penitents only in \u2018an open place, where they can be easily seen by others\u2019.[CITATION-36] Priests should employ servants who were \u2018advanced in years, and known for their modesty, prudence and blameless lives\u2019.[CITATION-37] A subsequent guide for priests offered more detailed measures, from leaving doors open when speaking in private to avoiding eye contact and keeping conversations as brief as possible.[CITATION-38] In the event that these safeguards failed, a disciplinary process would swing into action. Under rules approved at the First Provincial Synod, the Archbishop had the power to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to investigate and to rule on clerical misconduct. Two aspects of the Commission\u2019s rules of procedure stand out. First, it was not bound by judicial norms. Witnesses, for example, were not forced to swear an oath before testifying. A verdict was therefore unlikely to stand up in court. But this approach gave the Commission the flexibility to achieve its primary goal, namely to \u2018form as accurate a judgement as is possible as to the truth\u2019. The second key aspect of the process was its confidentiality. The Archbishop was enjoined to \u2018order secrecy to be kept as to all matters that transpire\u2019.[CITATION-39] Public exposure was to be avoided at all costs.It was at Manning\u2019s discretion to institute a formal proceeding against Capel. Rather than adopt this course, though, he took another approach. Ignoring Stourton\u2019s plea for anonymity, he conveyed her charges directly to Capel and once again demanded a response. The response took the form of a vicious personal attack. Stourton, in Capel\u2019s account, was a damaged, vindictive and above all sexually licentious woman. To prove this, he gave Manning a copy of a letter that Stourton had entrusted to him, and that gave harrowing details about her sexual history. Though she did not use the term, Stourton was the victim of rape. Her assailant was a married man whom she met during a stay at his aunt\u2019s house. One night he entered her bedroom and, as she described it, \u2018awoke me and did it and was gone before I was scarcely awake\u2019. She did not immediately understand what had occurred, and it was only some months later, having listened to other people and done some reading, that she revealed the crime to her mother. Far from showing any sympathy, her mother ordered her to go to confession and to undertake a spiritual retreat. This left her shocked and angered, and when her assailant began sending letters declaring his love, she seized the chance to escape a home where she felt lonely and miserable. They met in a hotel, and spent a week posing as a married couple.Capel hoped that this confession would destroy Stourton\u2019s credibility. Regardless of the circumstances, her decision to run away with a married man was proof, as he wrote to Manning, of the \u2018iniquities of this unfortunate girl\u2019.[CITATION-40] As several studies have shown, trials for sexual assault and rape in Victorian courts hinged on the character of both the victim and the accused. Men deemed to be respectable stood a much higher chance of acquittal. Women with a reputation for promiscuity were seldom believed.[CITATION-41] To reinforce her duplicity, Capel then provided Manning with letters in which she professed her friendship and admiration for him. \u2018Sad it is,\u2019 he wrote, to \u2018see such hypocrisy\u2019.[CITATION-42] Unfortunately, Manning left no record of his reflections. Given that this was the third accusation against Capel in five years, he must have entertained some doubts about his denials. But it is unclear if he was willing to believe Stourton, a young woman who, from his perspective, lacked the support of her family, confessed to engaging in illicit behaviour and showed affection for Capel even after he had so cruelly exploited her vulnerability. Another factor may have been his determination to see the Catholic University succeed. Launching an investigation into its rector less than a year after his appointment would not only be embarrassing but could prove fatal to the entire project. We can only speculate about his reasoning, but the upshot was that Manning decided to let the matter rest.In December 1878, the Cardinal finally convoked a Commission of Inquiry and set off a process that would lead to Capel\u2019s suspension. What was different this time? An obvious change was the poisoning of relations caused by Capel\u2019s disastrous stewardship of the University. Historians have identified several factors in its demise: the preference for Oxford and Cambridge among elite Catholics; the hostility of the English Jesuits to a scheme that undercut their plans for a college of higher studies; and the lack of support from Cardinal Newman.[CITATION-43] But Manning placed much of the blame on the negligence of its rector. In particular, Manning was angry that Capel broke a promise to give up involvement in a school for middle- and upper-class Catholics that he had founded in 1872. As a result, he failed to give the University \u2018the undivided care absolutely needed for success\u2019.[CITATION-44] The bishops soon discovered that he did not keep proper financial records, and could not even provide a statement of the financial position. Capel, Manning wrote in his journal, has \u2018wrecked our only united work\u2019.[CITATION-45] In an act that embittered relations further, Capel then claimed several thousand pounds from the diocese for expenses incurred during his rectorship.A second difference lay in the protagonists at the heart of the fresh allegations. Mary Stourton was a young woman with a troubled past who was cut off from the support of her family and the Catholic community. Now the accusations centred on a servant and her mistress, a respectable widow who was well known in Kensington and who enjoyed the backing of two prominent Catholic men, one of whom was her confessor. On 5 December 1878, Dr Henry Willington wrote to Manning to warn him of a \u2018scandal, that if it once gets into print\u2014as it will sooner or later \u2026 will be the largest scandal of modern times \u2026 in the Holy Catholic Church of England\u2019. Willington claimed to have proof that a priest in Kensington had \u2018made an attempt to debauch a young woman\u2019 and engaged in a series of \u2018lecheries\u2019 with another.[CITATION-46] At a subsequent meeting, he named Capel as well as the two women. The first was a servant named Lucy Stevens. The second was Stevens\u2019s mistress, Mrs Emily Bellew, who confided to Willington that she had engaged in sexual intercourse with Capel on many occasions over several years. This time Manning did not hesitate. On 27 January 1879, Capel was notified that a Diocesan Commission had been established to investigate acts of \u2018criminal intercourse\u2019 with Mary Stourton and Emily Bellew, and of \u2018indecent liberties\u2019 against Lucy Stevens. Two days later he arrived at the Archbishop\u2019s residence in Westminster where, before the four members of the Commission\u2014Reverend George Last, Canon Richard MacMullan, Reverend Edward Pennington and Reverend Daniel Butler\u2014he began a desperate fight to save his clerical career.Over the next weeks, the Commission achieved its twin objectives: first, getting to the truth of the allegations, and secondly, keeping the story out of public view. Its starting point was the case of Lucy Stevens. In the autumn of 1878 Stevens complained to Bellew about Capel\u2019s behaviour. On her advice, she dictated the following account to Bellew\u2019s confessor, Father Walter Robinson. On the evening of 20 October, Capel invited her to his house on what she called a \u2018false pretence\u2019. Expecting a servant to open the door, she was instead confronted with a drunk and aggressive Capel, who dragged her into the dining room, where he implored her to come to his bedroom. She would not fall pregnant, he assured her, and he would buy her a silk dress and find her a good husband. \u2018I have no doubt\u2019, she reflected, \u2018he did all he could to seduce me\u2019.[CITATION-47] Stevens managed to push him away and flee.Throughout its proceedings, the Commission was nothing if not thorough. Over a series of days it called a number of witnesses, including Lucy Stevens herself, and gave Capel the opportunity to rebut her accusation. He sought to do so in two ways. First he impugned her motives. Stevens, he alleged, had lost her position in Bellew\u2019s household after he reported seeing her cavorting with two men. The story of the assault was her attempt at revenge. Unfortunately for Capel, this was contradicted by evidence that Stevens had voluntarily resigned her position. His second claim was more persuasive. In her testimony, Stevens placed the assault in the dining room. The problem was that a bailiff charged with recovering money from Capel had been lodging in his house. The bailiff testified to using the dining room as his sleeping quarters at the time of the assault. When probed by the Commissioners, Stevens could not explain the discrepancy between her account and that of the bailiff.[CITATION-48] Even worse, and in what must have been an extraordinary ordeal, she was then confronted with her assailant. Surprisingly, however, Capel asked a few perfunctory questions only. No doubt he was confident that, in the wake of the bailiff\u2019s testimony, her story would not ring true. Stevens\u2019s status as a working-class woman also counted against her; in court cases, domestic servants rarely won cases for sexual assault against middle-class men.[CITATION-49] Above all, he knew that his fate hinged on the allegations involving Emily Bellew.There were several reasons why her case was pivotal. Her name was well known on account of her second husband, John Bellew, like her a convert to Catholicism and a famous preacher and public reader. As a middle-class widow, she benefited from the aura of respectability that was such a crucial factor in shaping perceptions of guilt and innocence. Bolstering her credibility further was the fact that she was a member of the Catholic community in Kensington and had the backing of men such as Dr Willington and her confessor Father Robinson. A sign of her status in the eyes of the Commissioners was that, unlike Lucy Stevens, she was not called upon to testify. Pleading ill health, she was excused from appearing. Instead, the Commissioners relied on a statement she made to Manning out of confession in January 1879 as well as the testimony of Dr Willington. Here there was an immediate discrepancy. Bellew told Manning that she and Capel first had sex in the autumn of 1874, not long after the death of her husband. Dr Willington testified that the scandalous relationship began a year later. Both affirmed, however, that the relationship continued until 1878. To avoid detection by the servants when Capel visited her house at night, Bellew gave him a latch-key, with a prearranged signal\u2014the hall light left off\u2014indicating that it was safe to enter. Even her involvement in a railway accident did not deter him. In September 1878, Bellew was on a passenger train that collided with several goods wagons at Sittingbourne, Kent. Five people were killed; Bellew suffered broken ribs. Still, Capel continued his visits to her house.[CITATION-50] In response, Capel resorted to his usual strategy of character assassination. In his depiction, Emily Bellew was a drunk and a hysteric who regularly took large doses of chloral. Prompted by Capel, her doctor from 1870 to 1874 testified that she was flighty and prone to exaggeration; he had stopped seeing her because he \u2018thought her a woman of dangerous character\u2019.[CITATION-51] Capel then produced private letters to paint her as unstable and infatuated. In one, dated 28 January 1875, Bellew lamented that he was no longer replying to her. She appeared flirtatious, describing her nature as \u2018intensely loving\u2019 and one that \u2018gives all and asks little in return\u2019.[CITATION-52] This was a woman who, as Capel claimed in his defence, \u2018undoubtedly tried to throw herself on me\u2019.[CITATION-53] But her fixation could quickly turn to rage. As proof, he released another letter to the Commission. \u2018You\u2019ve behaved\u2019, she wrote. \u2018\u2019, she continued, \u2018unless\u2019.[CITATION-54] The portrait that emerged was damning\u2014Bellew was an intense, deranged woman who craved a handsome priest\u2019s company and who reacted with fury when rebuffed. Goading her on were two more villains in Capel\u2019s narrative, Dr Willington and Father Robinson. Both nursed grudges against Capel; both saw in Stevens and Bellew the ideal tools with which to cut him down. Robinson, driven by jealousy at Capel\u2019s success, coached Stevens as she recounted her story to him, encouraging her to add more and more fanciful elements. Willington, who had never forgiven Capel over a petty dispute, stoked Bellew\u2019s anger until, in a state of drug-induced hysteria after her accident, she invented her bizarre claim.All of this was torture for Bellew. It had not been her decision to denounce Capel; Dr Willington had triggered the entire procedure when he took it on himself to inform Manning. In a letter to her confessor, Father Robinson, she described her bitterness at being depicted as \u2018intemperate and mad\u2019. It was true that she had taken small doses of chloral to ease her pain after the railway accident, but since her recovery she had abstained entirely. As for the charge of drunkenness, it would be \u2018lowering myself by even giving it a denial\u2019. The \u2018miserable business\u2019, she wrote, had left her in a state of \u2018deep distress and nervousness\u2019.[CITATION-55] Her distress deepened when anonymous letters began arriving at her home. One writer, who claimed to know embarrassing details about her past, warned that her \u2018wicked statements\u2019 about Capel, a man \u2018whose goodness and kindness is proverbial\u2019, were sure \u2018to cause you some trouble\u2019. Her behaviour, the letter continued, was the \u2018subject of conversation at the London clubs\u2019.[CITATION-56] Capel appeared confident that his fellow priests would never take the word of three women over one of their own. We can imagine his shock, then, at the verdict. Writing on behalf of the Commission, Reverend Butler began with the case of Stevens. While troubled by the discrepancy between her account and the testimony of the bailiff, he concluded that it was \u2018probable\u2019 that \u2018some criminal occurrences\u2019 had taken place. Capel\u2019s subdued reaction to her testimony had not helped his cause. His reluctance to confront Stevens directly during the hearings left the impression, as Butler wrote, that he was \u2018afraid of her\u2019. The Commission then turned to Mary Stourton, who was abroad at the time of the hearings, and judged the veracity of her account to be \u2018very probable, terrible as it is\u2019. The Bellew case proved most damning. Brushing aside the discrepancy as to whether the relationship began in 1874 or 1875 as a minor matter, the Commissioners judged that the \u2018copious documentary evidence\u2019 as well as the \u2018facts beyond dispute\u2019 allowed a clear verdict. A series of assertions, such as the frequency of his visits to her house, stood unrefuted. That they had engaged in sexual relations over a period of years was, Butler concluded, \u2018morally certain\u2019.[CITATION-57] Two other factors appear to have worked against Capel. First, his efforts to tarnish Bellew\u2019s character backfired. Even if true, her drinking and lax morals made the accusation more and not less believable. As Butler stated, the testimony that Bellew was a \u2018depraved person would only prove what was consistent with the charge\u2019.[CITATION-58] But the Commissioners were not convinced that she was immoral. Far from the vengeful obsessive described by Capel, she had come forward reluctantly, tried to shield him from censure, and made a sincere display of her shame. She passed, to their eyes, the crucial character test. Furthermore, the social stigma attached to female promiscuity in this era also worked to her advantage. No respectable woman, as one Commissioner noted, would risk damaging her reputation by inventing a sexual relationship with a priest. Her story therefore was more likely to be true.The second problem for Capel was the cumulative effect of the allegations. While each case on its own was far from conclusive, taken together they left little room for doubt. Thomas John Capel, as Butler summed up, was \u2018gravely unsuited\u2019 to exercise the duties of a priest, and \u2018grave scandal\u2019 was sure to result if he continued in a public role. This judgment did not bring him any joy. \u2018God knows,\u2019 Butler ended, \u2018what it has cost me to write as I have done of one whom I have loved as a brother for over twenty years\u2019.[CITATION-59] What does this reveal about the Church\u2019s response to accusations of sexual misconduct? It shows that the Commission of Inquiry was capable of acting as an effective disciplinary mechanism. The Commissioners took seriously the allegations, gathering and weighing up reams of evidence, and finding against a widely admired cleric. Admittedly, they seemed to come to this decision reluctantly. \u2018No charge against a priest,\u2019 as Reverend Pennington noted in his judgment, \u2018should be admitted unless it is clearly proved\u2019.[CITATION-60] This was particularly true in cases involving women. In Pennington\u2019s eyes, jealousy was their reigning emotion, and the root of many accusations against handsome priests.[CITATION-61] Despite this bias, the commissioners believed the claims made by the three women, and judged a fellow priest to be a liar.What is clear as well is that this was a process expressly designed to avoid scandal. This may have been in part to protect the women\u2019s reputations in a society where even a hint of sexual impropriety could be extremely damaging. But diocesan authorities had other reasons to cover up the affair. There was, of course, the spectre of public scandal. The explosive charges would have damaged the reputation of the Catholic Church in England, and triggered a new wave of anti-Catholic polemics about lecherous and corrupt priests. But a scandal could take other forms as well. When Reverend Butler warned of \u2018grave scandal\u2019 if Capel continued in his office, it is likely that he had in mind a certain type of sin. In this theological understanding, scandal came about when an evil word or action led to the corruption of others. As Manning himself explained in his treatise on sin, an immoral act that was \u2018publicly and notoriously done\u2019 would \u2018give scandal to others\u2019 since it would \u2018encourage and invite\u2019 them to commit sin.[CITATION-62] The encouragement could be direct, as when a thief incited others to steal. But it could also be indirect. By setting a bad example, a priest who broke his vows might trigger a loss of faith amongst his parishioners. Capel was a revered figure in the Church. If he were exposed as a sexual predator, the demoralising impact on Catholics was sure to be immense. Maintaining a cloak of secrecy over Capel\u2019s actions protected the public reputation of the Church and its clergy. But the diocesan leaders may also have felt it their duty to prevent his actions scandalising, in the theological sense, countless numbers of the faithful.Whatever their reasons, they were remarkably successful in limiting public exposure. The odd reference in the press tended to be oblique. In March 1879, the bishop of Birmingham, William Ullathorne, sent Manning a clipping fromwhich referred to \u2018Capel\u2019s difficulties, pecuniary and otherwise\u2019, but gave no further details.[CITATION-63] The overriding desire to hush everything up was even more apparent in what happened next. Manning demanded two things of Capel. First, he was to submit to his authority and not undertake an appeal to Rome, a course of action which was sure to attract harmful publicity. Secondly, in exchange for not having a sentence recorded against him, he was to leave England and stay away \u2018for such a time as shall render your return free from danger to others and to yourself\u2019.[CITATION-64] Despite knowing his unsuitability for his office, Manning offered Capel the chance to escape a formal censure by moving to another jurisdiction and avoiding further scandal.At this point, another lesson became apparent: namely, that a priest at odds with his bishop could seek protection from the Vatican. Refusing to accept Manning\u2019s terms, Capel turned to Rome for a number of reasons. First, England was still a mission territory, and as such under the jurisdiction of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Sacred Faith (Propaganda) in Rome. The head of the Propaganda, Cardinal Giovanni Simeoni, had direct control over the administration and organisation of mission territories such as England, and his authority extended to matters of clerical discipline. Secondly, there were leading figures at Rome who were keen to help Capel, even if it was only to embarrass Manning. Chief among these were the Jesuits, who had clashed with the Cardinal over several issues, including the University. The Jesuits helped Capel in 1879, and afterwards pushed his cause at Rome.[CITATION-65] Manning was made aware of such machinations by William Lockhart, the Procurator-General of the Order of Charity. There were, he warned the Cardinal, \u2018plenty of people in Rome that, to say the least, would delight in giving you a humiliation\u2019. The Jesuits would strive for this end \u2018con amore\u2019.[CITATION-66] Above all there was the Vatican\u2019s track record of upholding appeals by priests, even in cases of sexual immorality. This was made clear in a startling letter written by Bishop Patrick Lynch of Toronto to Bishop John Corrigan of New York, who in turn gave it to Manning on the condition that he destroy it. It is easy to see why Corrigan was so worried about the letter\u2019s contents. In Lynch\u2019s estimate, the Propaganda upheld appeals by priests against their bishop in no fewer than 75 per cent of cases. This leniency extended to sexual crime, as Lynch knew very well. In his own diocese, a tribunal found a priest guilty of fathering a child. The priest immediately appealed to Rome where, through a combination of lies and forged documents, he managed to overturn the verdict. Even more gallingly, Lynch had to pay compensation to the priest. The outcome was also telling. The Propaganda\u2019s solution was to shift the offending priest abroad, in this case to Mexico, with $300 to cover his expenses.[CITATION-67] Capel, in turn, was no ordinary priest, but was uncommonly clever, well connected and unscrupulous. He began by appealing to the head of the Propaganda, Cardinal Simeoni, for the verdict of the Diocesan Commission to be overturned. When this appeal failed, he sought a fresh trial from another Vatican Congregation, the Holy Office of the Inquisition. Initially established to rule on charges of heresy, the Inquisition\u2019s authority extended to a broad range of questions concerning faith, including accusations of clerical sexual misconduct. As an investigative body, the Inquisition had the power to gather evidence and to issue a verdict which, if favourable to Capel, would put enormous pressure on Manning to accept his reinstatement. Capel\u2019s strategy involved, as ever, a full-barrelled attack on his accusers. The first target was Father Robinson, Emily Bellew\u2019s confessor, and a man who, Capel made sure to note in his submission to Rome, was born a Protestant. The opportunity came in 1881. Capel accused Robinson of one of the gravest offences against canon law: deliberately breaking the seal of the confessional. In his account, one of Robinson\u2019s penitents, John Rutherford-Smith, revealed to him that he had received a letter accusing his wife of having an affair with Capel. Rutherford-Smith believed this disclosure to be protected by the confessional seal. But Robinson, consumed as ever with \u2018jealousy\u2019 at Capel\u2019s success, set aside his obligation as confessor and rushed to inform Cardinal Manning.[CITATION-68] The accusations against Robinson soon became public. An anonymous circular was sent to priests in the diocese, and several newspapers then revealed the details of what they termed the \u2018Kensington Confession Case\u2019.[CITATION-69] Robinson would eventually be exonerated, with the Inquisition determining that Rutherford-Smith\u2019s revelation occurred outside the confessional.[CITATION-70] But the charge allowed Capel to paint a picture of a Westminster clique determined to bring him down, a picture that his supporters embellished even further. Edmund Leahy, brother of a Catholic archbishop, told the Propaganda that Capel was \u2018in every way a model and pattern of the purest propriety\u2019, a cleric whose success had inspired a \u2018vile spirit of jealousy\u2019 among his peers.[CITATION-71] The next target was Bellew. In an appeal at Westminster against his verdict and then a submission to the Inquisition at Rome, Capel went even further in depicting her as lustful and dissolute. An affidavit by Mrs Guppy Volckman stated that Bellew routinely spoke in gross terms about sexual matters, boasted of having many lovers and threatened to seduce her husband. Another by Rose Freeland recorded Bellew\u2019s scandalous behaviour during a trip to France, where she made no effort to restrain or hide her \u2018strong passions for men\u2019. Bellew herself, Freeland affirmed, \u2018told me details of her doings \u2026 that I could not commit to paper\u2019.[CITATION-72] The appeal at Westminster failed. Reverend Butler restated his position that even if true, the charges against Bellew made the probability of an illicit relationship with Capel more and not less likely, although he never wanted to give the impression that he \u2018thought well\u2019 of Bellew.[CITATION-73] But Capel hoped that the Inquisition might conclude that Bellew, another Protestant by birth, could not be believed.The final target was Manning himself. Rather than attacking the Cardinal directly, Capel turned to a woman named Anne Gomess. Born in India, Gomess married an English civil servant in Calcutta in 1857. Her involvement in the Capel scandal began in 1878 when, leaving her husband behind in India, she arrived in England. By 1881 she was living with her daughter and two sons in Kensington, a short distance from Capel\u2019s residence at Scarsdale Lodge. It is not clear how they met, but Gomess was soon embroiled in Capel\u2019s scheme to restore his reputation. In June 1882, both Pope Leo XIII and the secretary of the Inquisition, Cardinal Panebianco, received a letter from Gomess accusing Manning of improper behaviour. She visited him at his request on 11 March 1882. At that meeting, she wrote, he pressed her on what she knew about Capel\u2019s behaviour. His language, by her account, was deplorable. \u2018He put me questions\u2019, she wrote, \u2018of the grossest and vilest kind, too shameful to write\u2019. The exchange was, she continued, \u2018such a shock to my faith that I write to humbly ask the Office of the Inquisition to obtain for me proper satisfaction\u2019.[CITATION-74] The following year, Gomess would reveal that Capel forced her to write the letter under the threat of physical violence.[CITATION-75] But when combined with lobbying on the part of Capel and his supporters, the result was a review of the case by the Inquisition.The outcome showed the determination of the Vatican to salvage the career of a prominent cleric. In August 1882, the Inquisition found the charges against Capel to be \u2018not proven\u2019. While conceding that the number of accusations was troubling, it ruled that the Diocesan Commission did not follow proper judicial procedures. This was a strange decision, since the procedures of the Commission, which had been approved by Rome, expressly placed finding the truth ahead of judicial rigour. But Capel\u2019s attacks on the character of his accusers\u2014the references to their Protestant origins, the doubts about their motives and their morals\u2014struck a chord. According to the judgment, the elements which cast doubt on his guilt included the \u2018different religions\u2019 of his accusers, as well as their \u2018suspected venality\u2019. Tipping the balance further in his favour was his record of outstanding service to the Church. Here was a priest, in the words of the judgment, \u2018of such capacity and of such merit\u2019.[CITATION-76] For Capel, this was a signal victory. Admittedly, the Inquisition did not rule that he should immediately resume his office in Westminster, instead suggesting that he stay in Rome for some time to undertake a period of reflection and spiritual exercises before a supervised reintegration into the ministry. But the path was now open for his eventual return to Kensington.The aftermath of the verdict revealed two further aspects of the Vatican\u2019s approach to clerical scandal. The first was its desire for secrecy. The second was its apparent ignorance of the workings of the press in countries such as England. In January 1883, the Propaganda gave Manning a dressing down in language that, as he wrote to the Bishop of Salford, Herbert Vaughan, \u2018I should not have used to the youngest priest in my diocese\u2019.[CITATION-77] New documents had emerged, a letter from the Propaganda warned, that spoke in Capel\u2019s favour and put the Cardinal in a poor light. The nature of these documents was not made clear. But most of all the Propaganda admonished Manning for failing to cover up the scandal, and particularly for not keeping it out of the secular press. This complaint was triggered by an article entitled \u2018The Truth About Monsignor Capel\u2019 which appeared in thein October 1882. Without naming the charges against Capel explicitly, the article made their nature clear. \u2018No person\u2019, the author claimed, \u2018is so cruelly exposed to certain accusations as a good-looking Catholic priest who goes into mixed society\u2019. In particular, he was always vulnerable to the malicious tongues of \u2018semi-hysterical devotes\u2019. But the reader should be assured that there could be no doubt at all about his innocence.[CITATION-78] The same year, thepublished a cryptic image of a smiling Capel swinging his umbrella. This was apparently a coded reference to debauchery, at least in the view of one of Manning\u2019s correspondents, Alfred White, who told him that it \u2018has a bad signification\u2019.[CITATION-79] In response, Manning laid bare his exasperation with Rome and his determination not to back down. He first tried to make clear that the Archbishop of Westminster had no control over what appeared in the secular press. He could not simply ban journalists from writing such stories, and any attempt to do so was sure to backfire. But what angered him most was the prospect of Capel returning to Kensington. He refused to even consider the idea, and played on Rome\u2019s fear of public exposure. The \u2018notoriety\u2019, he wrote to an unnamed contact at the Vatican, \u2018of Mgr Capel\u2019s evil life \u2026 is so prevalent and scandalous\u2019 that his return to England was sure to trigger a series of embarrassing revelations.[CITATION-80] Manning received regular reports about the spread of the scandal. Father Edward S. Keogh, Superior of the London Oratory, judged that the details were known \u2018probably to all of the Clergy and certainly to many lay persons\u2019. Fortunately, the \u2018charity and discretion\u2019 of the clergy had stopped the news reaching the general public, which as a result knew only of his financial troubles.[CITATION-81] Manning was also aware of yet more scandals brewing. In February 1882, John Rutherford-Smith, the man at the centre of the case against his confessor Father Robinson, informed Reverend Daniel Gilbert, the Vicar-General of Westminster, that his wife admitted to adultery with Capel. It had begun three years earlier when he was her \u2018spiritual comforter\u2019.[CITATION-82] Rutherford-Smith was now threatening to launch divorce proceedings and to name Capel in open court.By 1883 a stand-off had developed. Buoyed by what he saw as a complete exoneration, Capel was insisting that he resume his duties in Kensington. Manning was more determined than ever to prevent this. At this point, a solution that suited both Rome and Westminster appeared. In line with Manning\u2019s initial offer to Capel, he would be shifted elsewhere. In June the Propaganda informed Manning that Capel would shortly be leaving for the United States. It was Rome\u2019s \u2018express desire\u2019 that \u2018silence be maintained\u2019, and that the Cardinal strive in particular to prevent any further stories appearing in the press.[CITATION-83] According to Reverend Daniel Butler, who was by then living in Rome and working actively as Manning\u2019s intermediary, this outcome was the work of Pope Leo XIII himself. Capel received a letter stating that he was \u2018without censure\u2019 in exchange for, in a term that Butler attributed to the Pope, \u2018hiding himself\u2019 in America.[CITATION-84] For the Westminster diocese, this was welcome news. As Butler told Cardinal Luigi Jacobini, the Vatican\u2019s Secretary of State, \u2018we are only too glad to be quiet\u2019.[CITATION-85] Manning in turn promised to use his influence with the Catholic press to conceal the true nature of the case. As for the secular press, he could only re-state that his authority over it was negligible.[CITATION-86] The career of Thomas Capel deserves to be better known. For more than a decade he was one of the most prominent ecclesiastics in England until, to the puzzlement of many of his contemporaries, he simply disappeared. As the journalist Sir Henry Lucy recalled, \u2018no one knew why he had gone or whither he had fled\u2019.[CITATION-87] Now that the archives are accessible and properly catalogued, the mystery of his downfall can be explained. But more than this, the archives give us a fine-grained portrait of the unfolding of a sexual scandal and its aftermath in the nineteenth-century Catholic Church. The story that emerges is that of an unscrupulous priest prepared to defy his bishop in a desperate effort to avoid punishment for his sexual crimes. But what the files also reveal is the reaction of Church leaders to accusations against the clergy, the workings of internal processes to deal with such cases, and the patterns of friction as well as co-operation between Rome and the diocese.Several points about the Church response stand out. The first is the reluctance to investigate an important and popular cleric. Cardinal Manning was renowned for his commitment to improving the quality and discipline of his clergy. Yet, though aware of serious charges from 1870, he took no substantial action until December 1878, when Capel was no longer rector of the University, and their relationship had broken down. From that point on, Manning took a firm stance, demanding that Capel leave the diocese, and refusing to entertain the possibility of his return even in the face of pressure from the Vatican. Would he, though, have taken such a hard line towards a more penitent priest? We cannot know the answer, but some of Manning\u2019s allies in the episcopacy signalled their willingness to adopt a tolerant approach under certain circumstances. Bishop William Clifford told Manning that as a general rule a superior should help one of his fallen priests to \u2018save his honour\u2019, on condition that he confess his sins and repent.[CITATION-88] Capel, though, chose to deny everything, to lash out at his accusers and to continue his pattern of reckless behaviour. In this situation, as Clifford reminded Manning, tolerance was a dangerous position for Church authorities to take.Secondly, the Diocesan Commission was rigorous in gathering and examining the evidence and remarkably effective in containing leaks to the press. Setting aside their scepticism towards women who accused priests, the Commissioners came to a unanimous judgment that one of their own was guilty of repeatedly breaking his vow of chastity. The weight of testimony against Capel was certainly hard to dismiss. Yet certain points might have at least created doubt. Capel forcefully protested his innocence, a stance he would maintain for the rest of his life. Lucy Stevens\u2019s account of an assault in the dining room did not square with the testimony of the bailiff. The two men who instigated the case, Dr Willington and Father Robinson, appeared to hold a grudge against Capel. There were inconsistencies in Bellew\u2019s evidence, and several witnesses painted her as deceitful and immoral. Yet none of this swayed the Commissioners from bringing a rogue priest to heel. Getting to the truth, however, was only part of their aim. Just as important was avoiding public exposure, whether to prevent the sin of scandal or to spare the image of the Church from being sullied. Among the Catholic community in Westminster, Capel\u2019s disgrace was an open secret. In the wake of his appeal to Rome, more overt references appeared in the press. Yet, in explaining his rift with Manning, commentators pointed only to the University collapse and Capel\u2019s claim for financial compensation. The damaging headlines so feared by the Cardinal and the Vatican were kept largely at bay.Another lesson is that the outcome of such cases came about through a complex interplay between the diocese and the Vatican. The letter of Archbishop Lynch followed by the overturning of the Commission\u2019s verdict showed that offending priests who appealed to Rome stood a good chance of success. Certainly Manning and his supporters were disillusioned with what they saw as Rome\u2019s leniency towards priests who broke their vows. In 1879, Reverend Butler recalled the case of another Monsignor who was known to have fathered six or seven children, and who nevertheless became a Cardinal. Rather than take a hard line, Rome usually preferred, in his view, to leave such cases to individual conscience, and failing that, the judgment of God.[CITATION-89] Capel was ideally placed to exploit this leniency. He had a network of supporters prepared to plead his case, and he drew strength as well from the animosity towards Manning among certain factions. But Manning, too, had supporters in Rome and this, combined with his obstinate refusal to allow Capel\u2019s return, lead to an outcome that seemed to suit both sides.On the evidence of the Capel investigation, women who accused priests faced a traumatic experience. Admittedly, this was not a feature of Church tribunals alone. Domestic servants such as Lucy Stevens who accused respectable men of sexual assault or rape stood little chance of success in Victorian courts. And while judges were beginning to limit the admissibility of evidence relating to previous sexual behaviour, women complainants still faced a harsh interrogation of their morals and character. Though the Commission believed her account, Emily Bellew was left scarred by the process. In 1882, she wrote to Manning. She was still gripped, she wrote, \u2018by a deep sense of my own unworthiness\u2019, but hoped the Cardinal would grant her a meeting.[CITATION-90] He evidently agreed, for in a follow-up letter expressing her thanks, she confessed her guilt at having offended God, and prayed for the fortitude to bear her trials.[CITATION-91] There is no evidence of further correspondence between them. For Mary Stourton, too, the repercussions were difficult to bear. She managed to reconcile with her family, and by 1881 was living with her mother and sister in Brighton. But the shadow of scandal was never far away. In 1882, she wrote to Manning to beg for his help. While walking in the street with her young sister, a Catholic acquaintance had snubbed her or, as Stourton put it, \u2018cut me\u2019. She had never \u2018felt so pained in my life.\u2019 For all her efforts to live quietly and piously, the past seemed always to rear up again.[CITATION-92] Eventually, however, she seemed to experience an upturn in her fortunes. In 1891 she was still living with her mother, but this time as Mrs Mary Graham, wife of James, whom she had married four years earlier. Anne Gomess also appears to have struggled in the years after the scandal. In 1890 she was pursued in the courts for non-payment of poor rates; in her defence she argued that as a married woman she should not be liable, even though her husband was still living in India. She remained in Kensington until her death in 1906.[CITATION-93] Finally, there is an instructive lesson in the perils of transferring an offending priest elsewhere. Capel\u2019s reception in America in 1883 was initially enthusiastic. The press acclaimed the arrival of a man who was \u2018better known than almost any other Anglo-Roman ecclesiastic\u2019.[CITATION-94] Journalists predicted that the affable, handsome and intelligent cleric would win a devoted American audience, a prediction that was soon realised. Capel wrote excitedly to Cardinal Simeoni at the Propaganda, describing crowds of between one and three thousand at his public lectures, and enclosing a newspaper clipping praising him as \u2018the grand social lion\u2019 blessed with a \u2018towering form and noble presence\u2019.[CITATION-95] He appeared to have outrun his past. Then, in October 1886, came a bombshell. Under the heading \u2018Monsignor Capel\u2019s downfall\u2019, several papers reported that he was living with a woman named Alice M. Valensin on her ranch in California, and that her husband, an Italian Count, had named him in divorce proceedings.[CITATION-96] Capel denied the charges, but his threats to sue for libel were greeted with mockery. The public scandal so feared by Church authorities had come to pass, and Rome was forced to act. On 10 July 1886, Manning learned that Capel had been suspended, meaning that he was barred from performing Mass and administering sacraments.[CITATION-97] The disgraced cleric ended his career in the diocese of Sacramento, where he died in obscurity in 1911.[CITATION-98] To a modern eye, this seems a sadly predictable outcome. Prompted by the wave of clerical sexual abuse scandals across recent decades, scholars have begun to scrutinise the historical record to determine if such behaviour, as well as the cover-ups on the part of church authorities, form part of a longer pattern. As a study of one case, albeit involving a very prominent cleric, this article can only hint at an answer. Yet it is difficult not to see intriguing parallels between past and present. The obsession with secrecy, the leniency of some Vatican officials, and the preparedness to move an offending priest rather than punish him all seem to echo recent revelations. For historians of the modern era, there is a pressing need to unearth similar cases in the archives, and thereby shed greater light on the roots of the immense crisis that has engulfed the Catholic Church today."

    "title": "Habitat Protection, Ideology and the British Nature State: The Politics of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981*",

    "text": "The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was the most important piece of environmental legislation passed by a British government since the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. It sought to enhance the protection of listed flora and fauna, prevent further damage to existing habitat and resolve issues that had arisen with respect to rights of public access to the countryside. Although the bill was long and complex, many of its provisions sought to rationalise existing statutes or extend existing provision rather than create new powers. Provisions seeking to protect habitat proved highly contentious. The proprietary interest resented what it saw as an unjustified interference in private property rights; statutory bodies were alarmed that the centralising aspects of the Act would empower ministers at the expense of their \u2018scientific\u2019 independence; and the emergent environmental lobby, increasingly frustrated by the cautious approach of the statutory bodies, was determined that the bill\u2019s habitat protection provisions be strengthened. This article examines the lengthy and disputatious consultation and parliamentary process in terms of longer-term frustration with the apparent weakness of statutory protections and how it brought the environmental effect of agricultural intensification into mainstream political debate. This article contextualises the growing insistence that there was a public interest in the health of the natural environment and situates the argument with respect to what environmental historians have started to analyse as the history of the \u2018nature state\u2019, a distinct realm of state activity comparable to the welfare state, warfare state or security state.The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was the most important piece of nature conservation legislation passed by the British government since the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Part of its purpose was to resolve the tension between modern agriculture and nature conservation by strengthening the incentive-based approach to the protection of the \u2018scientific interest\u2019 in privately owned land. These apparently modest intentions belie its historical importance, which rests on its strengthening of the existing conservationist tools at the disposal of the UK nature state and the role played during the long parliamentary struggle by the emerging environmental movement and environmentalist ideas.[CITATION-1] Notwithstanding the seminal studies by W.M. Adams published in the 1980s and the recent legal analysis by Christopher Rodgers, the political conflict provoked by the bill has yet to attract significant attention from historians and is virtually absent from histories of Thatcherism or 1980s Britain.[CITATION-2] An urgent need to revisit the controversy has arisen from the indisputable evidence of the Act\u2019s failure to fulfil its basic purposes. As demonstrated by the authoritative State of Nature reports, published triennially since 2013 by the UK\u2019s leading nature conservation NGOs, the UK nature state has failed to halt or reverse declining biodiversity.[CITATION-3] An unprecedented number of species are threatened with extinction, and no serious commentator, including government spokespersons, disputes the basic claim that intensive agriculture is the most significant driver of biodiversity loss. Critics of the 1981 bill did not anticipate the depth of the later crisis but were nonetheless fiercely disappointed by the proposed bill\u2019s provisions, particularly with respect to the protection of habitat, and fought hard to have them strengthened. This article seeks to explain why they failed.The Department of the Environment considered the Wildlife and Countryside Bill to be a minor piece of legislation, \u2018no more than a tidying up measure\u2019. It sought to align British law with its international obligations, resolve some public access controversies, enhance existing measures designed to protect endangered species, and make provision for a modest strengthening of statutory habitat protection.[CITATION-4] It would incorporate the existing Conservation of Birds Act and the Endangered Species Act, deliver amendments required by the EEC (European Economic Community) Birds Directive and the Strasbourg Convention, and respond to the principal objective of the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on European Wildlife and Natural Habitats signed at Berne in September 1979, namely \u2018to improve the conservation of wild flora and fauna, and especially of migratory species\u2014not only by limiting hunting and other forms of exploitation, but also by protection of the natural habitats of Europe\u2019. The council recognised that responses by member states and other signatories (such as Norway) would reflect the relative strength and form of their existing environmental commitments.[CITATION-5] By strengthening existing conservation instruments for the protection of habitat, Part II of the bill attempted to meet these new international obligations.Past experience suggested the Department of the Environment might agree a draft bill with the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (MAFF), probably with input from the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU), take some account of consultations with statutory and significant non-statutory bodies, and then allow the government\u2019s solid majority in both houses to pilot the bill smoothly through parliament. Instead, difficult consultations ensured the drafting process took seventeen months and the subsequent refusal of the government to amend significantly the draft bill led to cross-bench opposition in the Lords and delaying tactics by the opposition in the Commons. 2,300 amendments and eleven months after the First Reading the bill finally completed its passage through parliament.[CITATION-6] For the first time, the most contentious aspects of high profile \u2018countryside\u2019 legislation concerned agriculture, habitat and ecology rather than issues associated with public access and landscape preservation or scenic considerations; also for the first time, preservation and conservation bodies, long accustomed to presenting evidence and arguments in public enquiries, played a central role in a bill process.[CITATION-7] Although these groups had neither the resources, access to ministers nor the political experience of the agricultural, forestry and landowning interests, their expertise and experience as activists made them a resilient presence in the process, making the Act\u2019s passage more disruptive than its provisions suggest.[CITATION-8] According to Michael Winter, bringing \u2018non-governmental organisations together for the first time in a legislative environment\u2019 helped constitute a \u2018defeat for agricultural exceptionalism\u2019, demonstrating that agriculture was no longer \u2018exempt from many of the rules operating in the wider society\u2019.[CITATION-9] Stuart Housden, parliamentary officer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), later commented that the Act\u2019s passage marked \u2018the birth of informed and advocacy-led nature conservation\u2019;[CITATION-10] at the same time, the process also exposed the growing division between the state conservation bodies, particularly the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), and the newly vocal, though still largely improvising, voluntary sector.The primary driver of the controversy was the government\u2019s attempt to diminish the contradiction between the actions of MAFF, principally grant-aided agricultural operations (capital works) and intensification via price support schemes and, from 1973, subsidies paid through the EEC\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy, and the statutory responsibilities of the Countryside Commission, the Conservancy and the National Park authorities. This brought into contention the convention that farmers and foresters, making use of their land as they saw fit, produced valuable landscapes, including the charismatic or focal landscapes protected by preservationist legislation.[CITATION-11] Environmentalists rigorously disputed this claim and argued that the ecological health of rural private property was a form of public interest that should be protected by the state. Consequently, the bill process saw the Conservative government\u2019s ideological commitment to voluntary solutions and the power of the proprietary lobby contend with faith in the efficiency of state intervention and public interest claims concerning the legitimate exercise of the state\u2019s coercive power.This made the bill process important to the history of the UK nature state, the \u2018set of institutions, regulations and relations\u2019 that seek to ensure the sustainable use of the natural environment, particularly with respect to maintaining or enhancing biodiversity. Such purposes enlarge the mandate of the state by generating \u2018a discursive and political shift in how, where and why the state actively exercises its authority\u2019.[CITATION-12] By this reading, the nature state, a corollary of the welfare state, the warfare state or the security state, signifies both a distinct realm of state activity and helps to determine the overall character of the polity.[CITATION-13] And most modern polities, irrespective of their political complexion, have developed a nature state, not least because international agreements and pressures are one of the dynamics driving its development. More particularly, agencies of the nature state\u2014sometimes working with international bodies\u2014help make the natural world politically legible by producing knowledge and understanding of the nature contained within its territorial ambit, thereby helping to establish natural assets as a set of public goods.The first part of this article traces the development of the UK nature state between 1949 and the 1970s, when significant concern about the environmental effects of agricultural intensification brought into question its underpinning assumptions, prompting the Labour government of 1974\u20139 to attempt to increase its powers. The decision to vest planning authorities with novel statutory powers prospected a significant break with established practice by increasing the power of the nature state at the expense of rural property rights, but Labour\u2019s Countryside Bill was lost to the dissolution of parliament in 1979. Nonetheless, its provisions provided a benchmark for critics of subsequent Conservative policy. A brief interlude examines how the crisis provoked by the attempt to convert the intertidal wetlands of the Ribble Estuary into grade one agricultural land both exposed the limitations of the Labour bill and forced the Conservancy to cast a cold eye on its existing powers and assumptions. This article then contends that the extensive consultation exercise conducted by the incoming Conservative government revealed how attitudes towards environmental policy, and habitat protection in particular, had become a major source of political division in Britain. Numerous statutory and non-statutory bodies opposed the government\u2019s rejection of \u2018stop\u2019 powers and its insistence that \u2018voluntary\u2019 measures were adequate, and many were concerned by how the centralising and apparently politicising aspect of the government\u2019s proposals seemed to threaten expert authority and autonomy.The government\u2019s refusal to accommodate these critiques directed attention to the parliamentary process, making the Lords and the Commons the principal forum for the national debate. Eventually, the government did introduce an \u2018element of compulsion\u2019 to the bill, though this concession neither created \u2018a regulatory prohibition on land use changes\u2019,[CITATION-14] brought agriculture and forestry operations into the planning system, nor challenged the SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) as the fundamental tool used by the state to delimit and make legible its conservation obligations. By empowering ministers at the expense of statutory bodies, the Act was an early signifier of the centralising tendency of the Thatcher governments. Just as the National Parks legislation of 1949 was consistent with social democratic legislation such as the National Health Service Act 1946, so the 1981 Act was of a piece with centralising legislation such as the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980 and subsequent Thatcherite policies.[CITATION-15] The long-term consequences of this narrowness of approach have been of tremendous significance. As the Glover Review (2019) observed, \u2018Our system of landscape protection has been hampered by having little influence over the things which have done most harm to nature. This includes a system of farming subsidies which, although it has improved, for decades rewarded intensification regardless of the consequences\u2019.[CITATION-16] More generally, given the urgency of the environmental crisis faced by human and non-human nature, it is all the more pressing that we develop a deeper understanding of the history of environmental policy and its implementation in modern Britain. As the concluding discussion suggests, these historical developments provide an important optic onto the intersection of government priorities, party politics and what constitutes the public interest and the legitimate reach of the state.In so far as the UK nature state had a singular moment of genesis, it was the establishment by Royal Charter in 1949 of the Nature Conservancy (from 1973 the Nature Conservancy Council). The statutory responsibilities of these bodies included conducting or commissioning scientific research, advising the government on the consequences for nature of policy initiatives, designating National Nature Reserves (NNR) and notifying planning authorities of the Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in their jurisdiction. NNRs were either owned or leased by the Nature Conservancy or were subject to a Nature Reserve Agreement, whereas SSSIs were established when planning authorities were notified by the Nature Conservancy of landscapes in their jurisdiction judged to be \u2018of special interest by reason of [their] flora, fauna, or geological or physiographical feature\u2019, qualities that should be accounted for before statutory planning consent was granted.[CITATION-17] In essence, the \u2018scientific interest\u2019 in land constituted the public goods which there was no market-based incentive to preserve or continue to produce through established land usage.At first glance, the NNR and SSSI system constituted an impressive achievement. By the mid-1970s, ninety-nine NNRs had been established in England and Wales, with a further forty-one in Scotland, covering some 300,000 acres in total, and 2.4 million acres in England and Wales and 1.4 million acres in Scotland had been notified as SSSIs. But the institutional presence and territorial footprint achieved by the British nature state was not matched by its regulatory powers. NNRs were relatively rare but subject to management regimes, whereas the system of notification used to establish SSSIs had few direct ramifications for landowners or landholders, who often did not know their land had been notified until applying for planning permission. This weakness stemmed from the decision to exclude agricultural and forestry operations from the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, ensuring planning authorities, including the National Park authorities, had no control over how land in their jurisdictions was farmed. That SSSI notification accounted for about 5 per cent of Britain\u2019s land cover by the late 1970s was less a function of the nature state\u2019s expanding regulatory power and more a reflection of the modest implications of notification. The publication of the Conservancy\u2019sby Cambridge University Press in 1977 threw these limitations into sharp relief. Containing detailed descriptions of 735 sites worthy of NNR designation, themade an unprecedented level of environmental knowledge available to those able to access its two costly volumes.[CITATION-18] The increasing availability of knowledge about Britain\u2019s natural assets is one reason the 1981 bill assumed such importance.The SSSI system reflected post-war attitudes and assumptions. Farming was judged to deliver a valuable suite of public goods, which included charismatic landscapes and, with help from the state, affordable food. Only a modest degree of environmental protection was considered necessary to preserve the biotic interest of certain significant, but relatively marginal, ecologies. And, as the content ofindicated, the focus tended to fall on uplands, reflecting a strong strand of conservationist commitment that dated back at least as far as William Wordsworth\u2019s(1835). Threats to the countryside tended to be associated with forms of urban overspill, be it new housing and industry, advertising hoardings and tourism, or the transgressive behaviour of an urban working class insufficiently schooled in the ways of the countryside.[CITATION-19] Despite this, from the late 1950s, the debate was gradually enlarged by the conservationist lobby\u2019s alarm at how state-subsidised agricultural intensification, engineered and delivered in collaboration with the agricultural lobby but underpinned by a social democratic commitment to cheap food, was re-structuring swathes of the UK countryside both visually and ecologically. The \u2018New Agricultural Landscapes\u2019 produced by these processes constituted what Sara Pritchard, writing about the post-1945 development of the River Rh\u00f4ne, terms a new envirotechnical regime.[CITATION-20] Growing concern about the grant-aided grubbing up of hedgerows and the effect of inorganic pesticides and herbicides on birdlife was thrown into sharp relief by the grant-aided conversion of moorland and heath to seeded grassland in Exmoor National Park and, to a lesser extent, in the North York Moors National Park. Exmoor farm holdings were relatively small, particularly if compared to their Welsh counterparts, and among UK uplands Exmoor\u2019s soil types and topography were most suitable for conversion and a significant increase in grazing intensity. Conversion required ploughing, digging rudimentary drainage systems, dressing the soil with lime, planting agronomic seed and applying generous quantities of chemical fertiliser. Between 1957 and 1966 conversion reduced the area of moorland on Exmoor from 23,800 to 20,100 hectares.[CITATION-21] In 1962, a major scientific paper by Norman Moore of the Nature Conservancy described the problem; in 1963, a Joint Standing Committee was established by the Nature Conservancy, the Forestry Commission, and the Ministry of Agriculture in order to improve communication between the three bodies, often unsuccessfully, and in 1964, the National Parks Commission began to concern itself with the \u2018very real danger to open moorland and downland in National Parks\u2019, but no means existed to prevent MAFF from funding ploughing, drainage and forestry schemes on SSSIs.[CITATION-22] Max Nicholson, director of the Nature Conservancy, identified the paradox. A land manager taking full advantage of the available grants could make marginal agricultural land yield more income than high quality agricultural land, but MAFF could not pay grants for maintaining the land\u2019s \u2018scientific interest\u2019. Anticipating debates to come, Nicholson asked whether a system could be established whereby the Conservancy could veto the payment of an agricultural or forestry grant and then make a compensatory payment of equivalent value.[CITATION-23] An opportunity to address this problem arose during the passage of Labour\u2019s Countryside Act 1968. The bill aimed to improve access to countryside close to urban centres by replacing the National Parks Commission with a new statutory body, the Countryside Commission, whose additional responsibilities included designating Country Parks. Clauses added to the bill responded to the growing ecological crisis by empowering the secretary of state for Housing and Local Government (the Minister for the Environment after 1970) to order farmers to give six months\u2019 notice of their intention to convert moor or heath to agricultural land. If a management agreement was not reached in that time, the county council could make a compulsory purchase order or an access order. The new provisions relied upon the local authority to initiate the process by appealing directly to the minister, a weakness the CLA and the NFU were quick to exploit. Working in cahoots with the Exmoor National Park Committee, the NFU and the CLA neutralised the legislation by brokering a \u2018gentleman\u2019s agreement\u2019 whereby Exmoor farmers would notify the park authority of their plans to convert unimproved grazing land.[CITATION-24] Despite the publication of a \u2018Critical Amenity Map\u2019 by Devon and Somerset county councils in 1970 that identified 17,631 hectares of Exmoor as needing statutory protection, the \u2018gentleman\u2019s agreement\u2019 ensured the powers created by the 1968 Act were never used, and by the mid-1970s every year approximately 128 hectares of moorland were still being lost to the plough.[CITATION-25] Habitat that had justified the designation of Exmoor as a National Park in 1954 was being irreversibly destroyed, a transformation most dramatic with respect to the conversion of Exmoor\u2019s celebrated heathland, the subject of many a gorgeously light-infused photograph.[CITATION-26] Although the language of reclamation was no longer freighted with the redemptive connotations of \u2018the age of improvement\u2019, and although the origins of state-led increases in productivity, including the management and eradication of livestock disease, lay in the \u2018missionary zeal for bringing land into production\u2019 promoted by the government during the Second World War, increasing yield remained morally charged socially and, at times, was a lightning rod for wider concerns.[CITATION-27] Global food prices suggested that increased agricultural output might help address the UK\u2019s trade deficit and, despite growing food surpluses, successive agricultural White Papers\u2014\u2018The Development of Agriculture\u2019 (1965), \u2018Food from Our Own Resources\u2019 (1975) and \u2018Farming and the Nation\u2019 (1979)\u2014were predicated on increasing agricultural yield.[CITATION-28] The broader context also nurtured autarkic tendencies. Anxieties about population growth, technological change, and the possibility that the Cold War might become hot, were further stimulated by high profile interventions by \u2018futurologists\u2019 that included Paul B. Ehrlich\u2019s(1968) and the Club of Rome\u2019s(1972).[CITATION-29] Underlying these fears was also a measure of post-colonial anxiety: did the rustic charm of the British countryside reflect relative under-development, enabled by the \u2018ghost acres\u2019 of the British Empire which provided the raw materials that underwrote British industrialisation, and did Britain\u2019s natural resources now have to compensate for the loss of the colonies?[CITATION-30] Was improvement on Exmoor and elsewhere a belated modernisation, a long overdue dose of technocratic efficiency?[CITATION-31] Environmental organisations did not necessarily reject the case for increasing production but made sharp judgements about which landscapes were suitable for further intensification. For instance, the Countryside Commission was acutely concerned about the harm moorland conversion did to the intrinsic value of the Exmoor uplands, but the logic of its critique was also economic. According to the Commission\u2019s figures, hill and upland farmers received 14 per cent of identifiable agricultural grant and yet only contributed 7 per cent of national agricultural output; studies suggested that, even if upland farms achieved the efficiencies of large-scale, lowland farming, output would increase by only 2 per cent. By this reasoning, grants to hill farmers did not significantly improve national food productivity and there was little prospect that they might do so in this future. This was not an argument for suspending payments altogether, for the Commission accepted the orthodoxy that farming maintained desirable landscapes and habitats in the National Parks, but the agency considered that this evidence demonstrated that there was no justification with respect to \u2018stated food production policy\u2019 to override the \u2018statutory purposes of the National Parks\u2019 and allow the further conversion of moorland. Further conversion also risked undermining Exmoor\u2019s tourist industry, so central to the region\u2019s economy.[CITATION-32] As the position of the Commission indicates, a striking novelty of the Exmoor controversy was how it made the plough a negative symbol, reversing conventional rural imagery.[CITATION-33] Overlapping but distinctive perspectives shaped objections to the plough. Conservationists saw \u2018improved\u2019 agricultural landscapes as landscapes of ecological loss; preservationists identified them as landscapes of aesthetic and cultural loss\u2014with the conversion of rough grazing went \u2018traditional\u2019 ways of farming the uplands, including the presence of \u2018heritage breeds\u2019; and those charged with enhancing amenity\u2014one of the key governing concepts of post-war Britain\u2014regarded these landscapes as potentially places of reduced public access, a form of social loss. In practice, it was difficult to disaggregate these three forms of loss, each of which constituted the \u2018attritional lethality\u2019 described by Rob Nixon as \u2018slow violence\u2019, though amenity and preservationist thinking tended to dominate the public debate for both were more politically legible than the scientific perspectives of the ecologists.[CITATION-34] Growing pressure led the Department of the Environment to commission Lord Porchester to make a \u2018study\u2019 of the situation on Exmoor. Porchester largely upheld the National Park Authority\u2019s critique of moorland conversion and made some significant recommendations: there should be a statutory obligation on the landholder to inform the park authority when it planned to reclaim land; the park authority should be empowered to make conservation orders binding in perpetuity and based on a one-off compensation payment; and MAFF should withhold grants where conservation objectives were paramount.[CITATION-35] These recommendations broke with the status quo in three respects. Porchester concluded that the system of voluntary land management agreements brokered by the Conservancy did not work, questioned the notion that National Park principles and modern agricultural purposes were fundamentally aligned, and concluded that the park authority needed a statutory instrument to prevent harm.[CITATION-36] Significant questions were thus raised about the limits of state authority and the degree to which politicians were willing to empower the state to protect the environment. Advocates of greater state intervention repeatedly came up against the claim that the agricultural habitus could not be brought as closely within the ambit of the state or made as subject to regulation as the other industries that exploit natural resources or whose actions have broader social or cultural affects or consequences. As the NCC repeatedly argued, often frustrating fraternal organisations, the \u2018goodwill\u2019 of the farmers was regarded as an essential commodity, without which any system of environmental regulation would fail.In the months before the publication of the Porchester Report, Whitehall officials began to discuss a possible legislative response to its likely recommendations. Officials at the Department of the Environment felt that the Exmoor National Park Committee had to adopt a more \u2018positive approach\u2019, working towards \u2018dynamic (and publicly worthy) compromises\u2019, but they also thought Denis Howell, the pugnacious environment minister, John Cripps, chair of the Countryside Commission, and the amenity societies needed to bring a \u2018greater sense of reality\u2019 to the controversy. Officials thought it \u2018totally unrealistic \u201cpolitically\u201d\u2019 that the Department of the Environment and MAFF would issue a joint statement to the effect that there would be \u2018no ploughing of any moorland which they judge to be environmentally important, no MAFF grant on such cases, no NPC compensation and indeed legislative provision for ploughing to be stopped with or without grant\u2019. Officials, however, did think a fundamental change in culture at MAFF was necessary. MAFF had to accept advice from environmentalists outside its own organisation, concede that \u2018there will be cases where agriculture needs to give way to the environment\u2019 and, crucially, recognise that it no longer had absolute dominion over agricultural land. Environmentalism, particularly when it was a public response to state-subsidised agricultural intensification, had changed the political context in which MAFF operated.[CITATION-37] Porchester\u2019s recommendations were enthusiastically received by Howell, prompting the resignation of Major-General (Ronald) Dare Wilson, Exmoor National Park Officer, and his replacement by Dr Len Curtis, Reader in Geography and Head of the Joint School of Botany and Geography at Bristol University. That marked a significant change in regime at the top. A ministerial nominee to the Exmoor National Park Committee was also sacked for proposing an anti-Porchester motion at an NFU meeting.[CITATION-38] As officials began to grapple with the political implications of Porchester\u2019s recommendations, there were early indications that Whitehall thought greater powers needed to be vested in ministers. As such, the Department of the Environment was untroubled that Moorland Conservation Orders (MCOs) would restrict the rights of land holders \u2018to use the land in certain ways not hitherto subject to control\u2019 but shared the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE)\u2019s view that a ministerial reserve power was needed should the park authority prove unwilling to act.[CITATION-39] Part of the political challenge concerned the basis on which \u2018compensation for loss\u2019 should be paid in the event of an MCO being made. Porchester maintained that a single payment was consistent with the existing statutory code but the NFU insisted that an annual payment should be made. MAFF was determined to resist attempts to impose external controls on farmers through management agreements and argued that the annual payments made to landowners for the protection of Ancient Monuments provided the nearest analogy. MAFF\u2019s position was weakened by its inability to predict whether a conservation order would lower the rental value of land, suggesting higher compensation payments should be made to the landowner, or whether an annual payment would be regarded as income, leading to higher rents. The argument went the Department of the Environment\u2019s way, and the government resolved upon a single payment.[CITATION-40] A more immediate challenge was whether the government could prevent ploughing once the report was published. The opposition refused to support the quick passage of a short bill to amend the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 and ministers were unwilling to make parliamentary time for a more substantial bill.[CITATION-41] With legislation ruled out for the current session, officials advised ministers to claim that they were giving the compensation question \u2018further thought\u2019, and that \u2018[e]xpediency dictates a noncommittal line deferring a decision for the present\u2019.[CITATION-42] In the event, the prospect of an imminent general election saw the Department of the Environment draw the bill tightly, restricting its provisions to national parks, initially only Exmoor and possibly the North York Moors.[CITATION-43] Tensions that had been simmering away for years on Exmoor were now brought to the Commons. Denis Howell\u2019s opening speech led with an encomium for the National Parks and the politicians who created them, outlined the background to the controversy and the decision to commission Porchester\u2019s \u2018study\u2019, and explained the necessity of Moorland Conservation Orders by emphasising the irreversible effects caused by ploughing moorland. Without \u2018statutory ground rules\u2019, he argued, it had proven impossible to reach agreements and, less plausibly, he rejected the claim that lack of funds had prevented agreements being reached. Under the new scheme, central government would cover 90 per cent of the cost of agreements, an increase over the usual figure of 75 per cent but not the full 100 per cent which Porchester had recommended.[CITATION-44] He also explained that he had given an undertaking to the NFU and other organisations that no order could be applied to another National Park without the minister coming back to the House.[CITATION-45] The Conservative opposition rejected Howell\u2019s underlying premises, insisting that the case had not been made that farmers were the principal threat to the National Parks, instead making the familiar argument that they were essential to the production of desired National Park landscapes.[CITATION-46] To claim, as opposition members did, that agricultural improvement was less significant than any number of other threats to the National Parks missed the point of the bill, while the logic of the opposition\u2019s objection to legislation that was designed to bring to heel a small number of farmers could be reversed.[CITATION-47] As the Ramblers\u2019 Association had explained to Porchester, the thirty to forty farmers who owned land in Exmoor\u2019s Critical Amenity Area should not have the power to undermine the Park\u2019s \u2018primary purpose\u2019.[CITATION-48] Determined to resist the creation of new powers, the opposition also insisted that EEC Directives did not prevent the government from making ploughing grants conditional on their being consistent with National Park principles.[CITATION-49] This had been a matter of contention between the Department of the Environment and MAFF, until a public letter from Roy Jenkins, President of the European Commission, resolved the issue.[CITATION-50] A member state was not obliged to grant aid to projects that were at odds with local or national environmental regulations, but nor was it permitted to make restrictions that did not apply to other farmers a condition of grant-aid.[CITATION-51] Labour backbenchers were keen to establish that MCOs could not be made in their constituencies, testimony to the cross-party sensitivities raised by the issue; Conservative MPs from Somerset and Devon keenly bore witness to their opposition to the bill, sometimes in indecorous terms.[CITATION-52] The bill was lost to the dissolution, but environmental organisations were optimistic. The Exmoor Society reassured its members that the opposition had accepted that it was necessary to create \u2018some statutory back-up powers for the National Park Authority\u2019 and a legislative and administrative framework that would encourage making management agreements. Even the NFU, the society claimed, had moved to a position of qualified acceptance.[CITATION-53] That optimism proved somewhat misplaced. The incoming Conservative government recognised the need to legislate and Michael Heseltine, first shadow and now the new minister at the Department of the Environment, quickly committed himself to a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 bill. The focus would no longer fall on Exmoor, but instead on a legislative agenda intended to streamline and strengthen existing statutory provision and fulfil the UK\u2019s increasing international obligations. Crucially, the Conservatives would renew the state\u2019s commitment to voluntarist arrangements, while transferring the proposed back-up powers to central government.As Howell\u2019s bill was discussed, the Conservancy and the RSPB faced a crisis that threw into sharp relief the limitations of Labour\u2019s Countryside Bill and the shortcomings of existing planning law with respect to environmental protection. In June 1978, an urgent situation arose with respect to the vital bird habitats of the Ribble Estuary in Lancashire.[CITATION-54] The Scarisbrick Estate had put on the market 6,000 acres of the estuary\u2019s intertidal land and the RSPB, with substantial financial aid from the Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund, managed to meet the \u00a31.15 million offered by Piet Heerema, a Dutch businessman, and his British partner, G.B. Crook, but still the sale was made to Heerema.[CITATION-55] Heerema planned to \u2018reclaim\u2019 the salt marsh, converting it from Grade Five to Grade One agricultural land, which did not need planning permission if classed as agricultural improvement. MAFF could withhold grant-in-aid for reclamation work if the Conservancy was opposed but could not prevent the work.[CITATION-56] Legal specialists at Department of the Environment thought planning permission was needed under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971 if it could be shown that this was an engineering project, but West Lancashire District Council had not thought so and Heerema, ignoring requests to consult with the Conservancy over a management agreement, had quickly contracted a civil engineer to begin work on the construction of a sea wall.[CITATION-57] Without an agreement, the only remaining option was for the Conservancy to request the minister approve a Compulsory Purchase Order under the 1949 Act and give the necessary boost to Conservancy funds. Whether the Conservancy could prevent harmful development in the meantime was unclear.[CITATION-58] Complex discussions with the local authorities concerning the status of the land and Heerema\u2019s overall plans were predicated on whether the 1971 Act allowed an Article 4 Direction to be made which would withdraw permission for developments otherwise permitted under the General Development Order. This would impose an immediate halt on the development but would create a liability to compensate Heerema should planning permission subsequently be refused. Only the planning process would reveal what portion of Heerema\u2019s plans were permitted agricultural development under the 1971 Act, though it seemed probable that later phases of his plan, including straightening a channel on Crossens Marsh to create a secondary sea defence, would require planning permission and depositing material on areas currently submerged at mean spring tides might require a MAFF licence under the Dumping at Sea Act.[CITATION-59] Under pressure, and gambling that Heerema would choose to sell rather than embark on a lengthy planning process likely to lead to a public enquiry, West Lancashire District Council made an Article 4 Direction on 18 July 1978.Heerema demanded \u00a32.78 million for the whole site, which he claimed accounted for the cost of reclamation and the agricultural potential of the site, a position consistent with the agricultural lobby\u2019s demand that land-holders subject to a Moorland Conservation Order be compensated for loss of potential earnings.[CITATION-60] Alternatively, Heerema offered to retain the most agriculturally productive portion of the site, some 1,500 acres, and sell to the Conservancy the remaining 4,000 acres for just \u00a3350,000, providing it did not object to his application to MAFF for grants or oppose his planning application.[CITATION-61] When 226 MPs signed an early day motion demanding the purchase of the whole site, the Conservancy rejected Heerema\u2019s offer, prompting his solicitors to withdraw all offers and the Conservancy to proceed with a Compulsory Purchase Order for the whole site.[CITATION-62] With Heerema\u2019s solicitors making increasingly absurd demands, and their planning application returned by the district council as inadequate, Crook broke ranks and telephoned the Conservancy to explain that he was trying to persuade Heerema, who wanted to sell for \u00a32 million, to accept \u00a31.6 million plus costs.[CITATION-63] On 20 March 1979, contracts were exchanged for the voluntary sale of the Ribble Estuary Marshes to the Conservancy for \u00a31.713 million.The Conservancy considered the wider implications of the Ribble Estuary controversy in an internal discussion paper. Although not a statement of policy, it demonstrated that the Conservancy, like the Whitehall civil servants considering Labour\u2019s Countryside Bill, was beginning to think that only ministerial authority could deliver effective environmental protection. In this case, harmful development had been halted by the Article 4 Directions, but there was no guarantee that local authorities would protect public goods without clear economic or political value:In other words, a major and urgent threat to an internationally important site involving activity which could not be construed as falling within planning law,\u2026 can arise, and does now arise on an increasing number of key sites throughout the UK. In such a situation NCC is totally reliant on its capacity to rapidly persuade the owner to negotiate a sale, lease, or Nature Reserve Agreement over the land, operating with slender resources of money and manpower and with no supporting apparatus in terms of central or local government.[CITATION-64] Consequently, the Conservancy needed a \u2018\u201cbraking\u201d mechanism\u2019 that could be applied when development threatened the most vulnerable key sites, such as wetlands, chalk grasslands and ancient, deciduous woodland, particularly when such sites came up for sale. But such a power would not be sufficient to overcome the Conservancy\u2019s fundamental institutional weakness. New processes were required in which the Conservancy would be an advocate rather than the agency responsible for preventing harmful developments. Outcomes would be then decided by a higher authority, presumably a minister, which the Conservancy considered would be tantamount to introducing planning control over aspects of agriculture and forestry. The Conservancy recognised that this was liable to provoke significant opposition.[CITATION-65] Similar thinking was at work in the Department of the Environment, but its approach took policy in a direction the Conservancy would come to find deeply troubling.On 11 May 1979, just over a week after the general election, the Conservancy was informed of the new government\u2019s plan for a \u2018composite wildlife bill\u2019. Rather than empowering the National Park authorities by instituting an equivalent to the previous government\u2019s proposed Moorland Conservation Order, the new government planned to centralise the process by vesting new powers in the secretary of state with respect to both \u2018moors and heaths\u2019 and sites notified as SSSIs. The SSSI notification system would be enhanced with the introduction of a new site category that would require owners or occupiers to notify the Conservancy six months in advance of operations that would change the agricultural use of the land; under pressure from the conservation lobby, the period of notification was later raised to twelve months. The new category would apply, firstly, to sites bound by international obligations (under the Ramsar and future conventions), secondly, to sites crucial to the survival of certain \u2018imperilled\u2019 animal and plant species and, thirdly, to sites identified by the secretary of state as worthy of protection \u2018in the national interest\u2019. Crucially, the new site category would be notified by the secretary of state, rather than the Conservancy, and include all the encumbrance of an appeals process, but once made, central government would provide the Conservancy with the financial support necessary to secure the site\u2019s protection through a management agreement.[CITATION-66] A single compensatory payment was off the agenda.Initial responses at the Conservancy reflected its conflicted position and political weakness. It was not convinced that the government\u2019s commitment to protect wildlife and bird species was underpinned by a proper recognition that habitats were most threatened by changes in \u2018agricultural regime\u2019 that were \u2018not subject to statutory planning control\u2019;[CITATION-67] it was nervous that greater constraints on land use would \u2018alienate landowners whose goodwill is essential to the furtherance of nature conservation\u2019, a claim later used by government spokespersons to defend the bill against critics who thought its provisions were too limited; and it was concerned that the rigid application of international conventions that did not impose statutory obligations on governments would inhibit its freedom to maintain the \u2018range of variation in natural and semi-natural ecosystems in Britain\u2019, including species that were not rare elsewhere.[CITATION-68] The Department of the Environment was emollient in response. Sites designated by the minister additional to those identified by the Ramsar convention would be recommended by the Conservancy and the land-use implications would be \u2018low-key\u2019.[CITATION-69] However, the government\u2019s suggestion that the new designations should be called National Nature Reserves in order to appeal to the voluntary bodies provoked affront: the Conservancy was quick to remind the government that NNRs and NNR Agreements already existed under the 1949 legislation.[CITATION-70] Officially, the proposed new sites would be made subject to a Nature Conservation Designation Order (NCDO), but in practice these sites quickly attracted the soubriquet \u2018super-SSSI\u2019, a term that did not have an official status but quickly passed into general use.The formal consultation document circulated by Department of the Environment shortly afterwards quoted Conservancy figures to the effect that 4 per cent of SSSIs were severely damaged every year, meaning the government was not meeting its international obligations, and it conceded that relying on the voluntary co-operation of land occupiers without any statutory means of preventing harmful activities had not proven effective. Existing provisions meant that the Conservancy could do little to prevent a harmful agricultural operation taking place if a management agreement was not reached under the 1949 Act. Under the new proposals, the sites designated by the secretary of state would be subject to a twelve-month notice period before operations detrimental to the scientific value of the site that were not covered by planning law could be undertaken. Once notified, the Conservancy had three months to either give consent or begin the process that would lead to a management agreement, failing which it could issue a Compulsory Purchase Order.David Goode, the Conservancy\u2019s assistant chief scientist, conceded that the new designation could have \u2018considerable benefits for nature conservation\u2019 in lowland grasslands, heaths, wetland and woodlands vulnerable to agricultural improvement and in uplands suitable for afforestation. This was a clear advance over the Labour bill. Internal discussions, however, soon raised questions about the wider ramifications for the SSSIs not subject to the special designation and the Conservancy\u2019s continuing efforts to create National Nature Reserves. Derek Ratcliffe, the Conservancy\u2019s chief scientist, thought the consultation document \u2018slovenly and amateurish\u2019, describing the decision to draft it without reference to the Conservancy \u2018arrogance of an order\u2019 he found \u2018breathtaking\u2019 []. The Conservancy also found the financial implications of the proposals unclear and feared the new designation would effectively downgrade existing NNRs, altering the Conservancy\u2019s priorities and subjecting it to close supervision by the Department of the Environment.[CITATION-71] Worse still, making the new NCDO subject to interdepartmental consultations would allow MAFF or the Forestry Commission to undermine the authority of the Conservancy. In short, the proposed two-tier system would make it harder to protect those sites with the lower rating, have serious consequences for the Conservancy\u2019s continuing capacity to designate NNRs, and would strengthen central government at the expense of the Conservancy\u2019s capacity to make independent, science-based decisions.[CITATION-72] Despite these private reservations, the Conservancy\u2019s formal response found the government\u2019s proposals limited but broadly acceptable.[CITATION-73] As such, the Conservancy did not accede to pressure from the Wildlife Trusts, the World Wildlife Fund or the RSPB to reject the proposals or support the Countryside Commission\u2019s push for the government to have the power to make a \u2018Conservation Order\u2019 when an agreement could not be reached in the twelve-month period.[CITATION-74] In retrospect, it is clear that the Conservancy\u2019s position looks more pragmatic than its critics within the wildlife lobby were willing to concede. To widen the remit of the previous government\u2019s proposed Moorland Conservation Orders to all SSSIs, including the provision for compensation payments, had vast resource implications and the Conservancy was careful to distance itself from this proposal.[CITATION-75] Nonetheless, the Conservancy\u2019s wariness about the two-tier system gradually hardened into opposition. It became convinced that the bill represented a fundamental challenge to its autonomy as a body tasked with designating SSSIs, acquiring NNRs and making NNR agreements on a strictly ecological basis. To make its recommendations subject to interdepartmental wrangling was more disturbing still. At a meeting in the House of Lords in the October, the peers who later sought to amend the bill in the parliamentary battles of early 1981 confronted the Conservancy with the logic of its own findings: in essence, voluntarist approaches had not prevented harm to the SSSIs. The solution hit upon was \u2018reciprocal notification\u2019, whereby the Conservancy would present every owner of an SSSI with a bespoke list of \u2018potentially damaging operations\u2019 and in turn the owner would be responsible for giving the Conservancy advance notice of any plan to enact such operations, under which circumstances the Conservancy would seek a management agreement that would include compensation payments. The power of the argument, according to one who was present, constituted \u2018a sublime triumph for conservation evidence, and for forthright and disciplined advocacy. And it was justice for nature\u2019.[CITATION-76] In December 1980, shortly before the Second Reading in the House of Lords, the Conservancy made a formal volte-face, resolving that the twelve-month notification process should be applied to all SSSIs, with the option of imposing a stop order with compensation if a management agreement was not reached.[CITATION-77] The response from the Department of the Environment, as revealing as it was negative, recalled the interdepartmental discussions provoked by Labour\u2019s failed bill. The agricultural lobby could not be persuaded to accept this because the compensation code only allowed for payment of a capital sum and not for annual payments in cases where compulsion was involved.[CITATION-78] The government would not budge in its determination to apply the new measures only to a small number of sites.[CITATION-79] The government\u2019s proposals for the conservation of \u2018moors and heaths\u2019 in National Parks were distinct, though the National Parks invariably contained SSSIs and it was often difficult to treat the proposals separately. Addressed to the wide range of statutory and non-statutory bodies with an established voice in the debate, the consultation document presented the choice as between an \u2018entirely\u2019 voluntary approach or a system which provided \u2018compulsory powers for use in the last resort\u2019. The government advocated financed voluntary management agreements that enlisted the \u2018co-operation of the farmers who occupy, manage and (in many cases) own the moorland and whose traditional practices are largely responsible for its present appearance\u2019. Recent experience of successful voluntary agreements on Exmoor, the government claimed, demonstrated that the case for compulsory Moorland Conservation Orders had weakened, though the government was not yet prepared to explain how the new schemes would be financed (not \u2018a suitable subject for inclusion in the Bill\u2019).[CITATION-80] Again, the most significant proposed change was the extension of the notification period from six to twelve months. The National Park authorities would still be required either to give consent or to initiate negotiations for an agreement within three months but if a park authority refused consent MAFF would probably refuse grant-aid. Conceding that a small number of farmers might still choose to plough, the government would introduce a new power allowing ministers at the Department of the Environment and MAFF to make jointly a compulsory notification order for the whole or any part of a National Park, though this could be annulled by a parliamentary motion.[CITATION-81] Powers that the Labour bill would have vested in the park authorities were to be arrogated to ministers.Responses by the park authorities, the county councils and the county wildlife trusts were guardedly favourable, but few felt the proposals went far enough.[CITATION-82] The emerging consensus was that the twelve-month notification period should be extended to all SSSIs, all AONBs and, possibly, all sites identified in the NCC\u2019s, creating a situation akin to listed buildings. Some planning authorities were concerned that MAFF, already considered overmighty, would be strengthened by the legislation, and a vigorous defence of the Conservancy\u2019s independence was often made. Questions were raised about the sufficient resourcing of the voluntary system and the basis on which compensation would be paid, and there were mixed views about dropping the Moorland Conservation Order as a necessary intermediary step before the ultimate sanction of a compulsory purchase order.[CITATION-83] The most conspicuously ecological perspective was voiced by Tyne and Wear, a metropolitan authority responsible for the watersheds of two large rivers. Lamenting the \u2018lack of any sense of ecological values\u2019 in the government consultation, the council argued that too much emphasis was placed on \u2018sites\u2019 and not enough on the wider effects of changes to agricultural practice, including interventions such as drainage that affected adjacent or nearby sites. The government needed to develop a better sense of the \u2018wider\u2019 countryside, concerning itself less with protecting individual species and more with conserving \u2018plant and wildlife\u2019.[CITATION-84] Tyne and Wear\u2019s critique chimed with that of scientists troubled by the \u2018unecological\u2019 focus the proposals placed on species protection rather than the conservation of habitats or species assemblage and how the narrow focus on rare habitats gave little scope to local authorities to look after its non-agricultural land in the interests of nature.[CITATION-85] More generally, the planning authorities were frustrated by a system that could continue to impose few restraints on farming and forestry. A planning application for fifty houses on \u2018moor or heath\u2019 could be rejected without the prospect of compensation whereas ministers \u2018recoil from a far lesser power, to prevent an agricultural operation with compensation payable\u2019; similarly, a park authority could make an access order but had no back-up power with respect to conservation.[CITATION-86] Two particular cases were deployed to highlight the shortcomings of the proposed measures. First, the conflict between the Peak District Park Authority and the new owners of the Roaches Estate (a 1,000-acre site in the Staffordshire moorlands) over grazing intensity; and, secondly, the long-running conflict over the wildlife-rich West Sedgemoor SSSI (a low-lying Somerset wetland), whose latest phase had been provoked by grant-aided peat extraction: despite the Conservancy\u2019s objections, the owner could \u2018destroy\u2019 valuable habitat \u2018with impunity\u2019. According to the local authorities, these cases demonstrated that an MCO was essential not just to prevent ploughing and other acts of improvement but also more traditional land uses.[CITATION-87] The concerns of Britain\u2019s wildlife and environmentalist charities and trusts echoed those of the planning authorities. The RSPB and Friends of the Earth had long advocated increased powers for the Conservancy. As the RSPB argued, plant and wildlife communities, rather than individual species, should be protected and a \u2018catch-all clause\u2019 was necessary to allow the secretary of state to make a stop order. Ultimately, the RSPB\u2014which expressed itself more forcefully than Friends of the Earth\u2014believed farmers needed to be made subject to closer state control. In essence, systems of governance applied to the built environment should be applied to the unbuilt. \u2018We do not believe\u2019, the RSPB explained, \u2018that landowners should be compensated for accepting land use controls imposed in the best interests of the nation: all elements of society are obliged to accept constraints on certain aspects of their behaviour for the general good\u2019. Landowners or occupiers should be paid to manage their land according to the wider good, but this could only be effective if grant-aid for agricultural improvement or forestry in SSSIs was not allowed to distort the Conservancy\u2019s efforts to broker management agreements. The World Wildlife Fund was more negative, but also more distanced from the detail of the debate, blandly stating that the priority should be safeguarding habitats and it doubted the proposals would have much positive effect. All land designated by the Conservancy needed protection under conservation orders comparable to Porchester\u2019s MCOs.[CITATION-88] The weight of evidence critiquing the proposals did not give the government much pause for thought. Landed, agricultural and forestry interests largely supported the bill and the Country Landowners Association (CLA) received further reassurance at a Department of the Environment meeting. In particular, the CLA was assured that the government\u2019s terminology should not cause alarm. Little land would be categorised in order to protect \u2018imperilled\u2019 species, particularly when birds, such as the red kite in Wales, had very large ranges. As a department official explained, confirming the Conservancy\u2019s worst suspicions, \u2018the definition imperilled was carefully chosen; it allowed for a political as well as a scientific judgement\u2019. With respect to the habitats identified under international conventions such as Ramsar, the government explained that, although it needed to fall into line with these obligations, the provisions only applied to thirteen sites, one in Northern Ireland and twelve in Britain. Most were already NNRs, so the implications of this category were minimal. Although the government insisted the Ribble controversy had shown that it needed new powers to respond to questions of acute public concern, the fact remained that these decisions would be made by the Department of the Environment and MAFF, meaning objections could be heard, making this a more overtly political process that the current system. The Department of the Environment did, though, admit that SSSI designation would continue and it could not assure the CLA that only existing SSSIs might come under the new designation; the Department added that it was ready to consider allowing a longer time to negotiate an agreement. In the main, the Department thought the CLA was satisfied and, with respect to moorland conservation, accepted that MAFF grant-aid for ploughing should not be paid if the park authority refused consent.[CITATION-89] The forestry interest was less acquiescent and on the defensive. Already subject to criticism by a host of amenity societies and frustrated by the obstacles often put in its way, the industry thought the proposals insufficiently heeded questions of scale and raised the prospect of great swathes of land being closed off from productive use. Designations needed to be more selective, implicitly acknowledging the benefits brought by the forestry sector on environmental, economic and resource grounds. Not only did the industry create valuable habitat, jobs and an essential, marketable commodity, but in doing so it fulfilled the government\u2019s own planting quotas. The conservation and amenity lobby, as well as the Conservancy, had repeatedly frustrated attempts to establish new plantings. Local economies were harmed by a politics that, paradoxically, was predicated on protecting a \u2018moorland scene\u2019 that was far from \u2018\u201cnatural\u201d\u2019. Further designations, it claimed, were not needed.[CITATION-90] Marion Shoard, who worked for the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE), published her brilliant polemic(1980) on the eve of the bill\u2019s first reading. It functioned rather as Rachel Carson\u2019s(1962) had a generation earlier, electrifying the debate by synthesising the concerns of scientists and lobby groups.[CITATION-91] As Shoard told Caroline Moorhead of the, the principal threat to the countryside \u2018comes from agricultural change, which if allowed to proceed unhindered could easily turn our variegated, intimate landscape[,] which is the envy of the world[,] into something reminiscent of the Kansas prairies\u2019.[CITATION-92] A core argument of the book was that the farming community, in cahoots with the government, did not have the right to harm unilaterally the countryside because the countryside was a public good. Over the following weeks, the contents of theletters page proved how divisive her claims were.[CITATION-93] The government decided to present the bill in the House of Lords because the latter contained considerable expertise and, recalling an earlier parliamentary ethic, it was here that countryside interests were thought to be properly represented.[CITATION-94] More practically, the unexpectedly contentious nature of the legislation promised a lengthy parliamentary process that threatened to endanger the government\u2019s busy legislative programme. The suspicion that this decision gave agriculture, forestry and landed interests undue influence was far from groundless. During the debates, members complained about the effect existing environmental legislation and regulation had on their rights as landowners, accusing the environmentalists of devious and underhand tactics.[CITATION-95] But it was also the case that the House of Lords contained significant environmental expertise. Amendments seeking to strengthen the bill\u2019s provisions were tabled by members closely associated with conservation NGOs and their actions were co-ordinated by the Wildlife Link, the successor to the Council for Nature, a low-profile organisation that had sought to co-ordinate conservation organisations since the late 1950s. From 1979, Wildlife Link was chaired by Lord Melchett, a young and charismatic Labour peer, who emerged as the effective leader of the opposition to the bill.[CITATION-96] Melchett was supported to one degree or another by members with close links to statutory and non-statutory conservation and amenity organisations. Lord Hunt was president of the Council for National Parks; Lords Arbuthnott and Chelwood both held senior positions in the Conservancy; Lord Craigton was the long-term chair of the All-Party Conservation Group (1972\u201383), vice-chair of the Flora and Fauna Preservation Society, chair of the Council for Environmental Conservation (Lord Skelmersdale was vice-chair), vice president of the World Wildlife Fund, and a trustee of the Jersey Wildlife Trust; and Lord Buxton was co-founder of the World Wildlife Fund (and an associate of Prince Philip, the Fund\u2019s long-running president), patron of the Essex Wildlife Trust and director of Anglia Television and creator of \u2018Survival\u2019, one the UK\u2019s longest-running wildlife television series. Lord Sandford, chair of the National Parks Policy Review Committee (1974), was not an outspoken critic of the government but had come to recognise the necessity of Porchester\u2019s recommendations and felt the government\u2019s decision to reject them needed careful justification.[CITATION-97] The parliamentary process was dizzying in its complexity. Something of this stemmed from the political, economic and ideological complexity of the issues, but it also reflected the straitjacket of the SSSIs. In its essence, whereas Labour\u2019s bill had attempted to create a new power that in certain circumstances could be used to override existing provision, the Conservative bill sought to reform existing statutory provision, leading to a debate\u2014like the consultation\u2014focused on notification periods, management agreements and principles of compensation, the primary tools of the nature state. Consequently, proponents of the bill made repeated attempts to strengthen the proposals by making subtle adjustments to its provisions. The committee stage saw numerous amendments taken together, many withdrawn before debate, and some debated but withdrawn before going to a division. As Philip Lowe and his co-authors observe, \u2018none of the amendments won by the conservation lobby against the government advice was opposed by the farming lobby, whereas all major amendments opposed by the NFU and CLA were defeated, and these included powers to make moorland conservation orders and to protect all SSSIs\u2019.[CITATION-98] Despite this, amendments functioned as acts of witness, bringing matters of concern to the notice of parliament, the government and the general public, exposing unintended weaknesses in the bill and, more provokingly, highlighting what the government was not prepared to do and how it had rejected expert opinion or mollified particular interest groups. Parliamentary convention judged these effects as positive, and for some peers the passage of the bill constituted a truly impressive political and intellectual performance; but for the government\u2019s critics the enduring sense of failure associated with the Act raised fundamental questions about what could be achieved through the parliamentary process.Although the case made by the bill\u2019s critics largely mirrored positions adopted by the statutory and non-statutory bodies, the debate brought to the Lords considerable environmental expertise. Conservancy statistics were often deployed, notably by Melchett, who argued that the narrowness of the bill ensured it would not mitigate existing risks or the wider threat posed to the \u2018basic fabric of the countryside\u2019, including wildlife habitats such as ponds, hedges, hedgerow trees, small woodlands and moorland.[CITATION-99] Broad historical perspectives onto the relationship between agriculture and the health of British ecosystems were offered, notably by Buxton, who identified the problem as stemming from an outmoded, wartime need to maximise production\u2014food surpluses rather than shortages were now the norm\u2014and a policy agenda that had not kept pace with \u2018the technological or power revolution in agriculture\u2019. This was compounded by a fundamental failure to comprehend the nature of farmland. In \u2018wildlife terms\u2019, Buxton explained, \u2018a ploughed field or clean farming land is in fact simply a desert in another form\u2019. The \u2018survival factor for wildlife\u2019 was to be found in the agriculturally marginal features of the landscape, in the hedgerows, woodland, moorland, ponds and wetland: \u2018The Government remain, through grant aid, the chief instigators and supporters of habitat destruction\u2019. Much of this polemic recalled Shoard\u2019s.[CITATION-100] Cross-party alliances were made. Lord Foot, Liberal peer and Dartmoor preservationist, and Lord Ridley, Tory peer and owner of a Northumberland estate, urged that the compulsory powers of the Labour bill be reinstated, Ridley tabling an amendment to this effect.[CITATION-101] Labour peers seemed to be genuinely perplexed by the attitudes expressed by the supporters of the government with respect to the necessity of maintaining the goodwill of the farmers. Why was the NFU \u2018regarded as a more benign combination than, say, the Transport and General Workers Union\u2019, when \u2018their acquisitive instinct\u2019 had been \u2018developed along similar lines\u2019?[CITATION-102] Why had such great efforts been made to secure the support of the National Farmers Union and the Country Landowners Association, but not the National Trust, the Conservancy, and the Countryside Commission?[CITATION-103] The notion that farmers \u2018can be led a long way\u2019 but \u2018one cannot push them one inch\u2019 provoked particular outrage.[CITATION-104] It was improper, declared Baroness White, \u2018for citizens of any civilized and democratic body politic to suggest that they should have a different attitude to the law from that of any other citizen. We are all, being members of a community, subject to certain constraints and certain compulsions\u2019. It was difficult \u2018to work for peaceful solutions when one has the attitude that the farmers, landowners and perhaps even the timber-growers are so special that they must not contemplate being bound in the sort of way that so many of us, after all, in so many different situations in life, accept as part of the price to be paid for being members of a civilised society. Why should they be exempt?\u2019[CITATION-105] In January 1981, a week before the bill entered the committee stage, David Goode published a short, hard-hitting article in the. Goode focused on the harm done to SSSIs since the 1960s, confronting the reader with an avalanche of statistics, some of which drew on research that could document ecological decline since the 1760s. His case was familiar. The ploughing and drainage or irrigation of grassland, heath, bogs and deciduous woodland had caused unprecedented and largely irreversible depletion in the extent and diversity of the Britain\u2019s flora and fauna. Although the problem far exceeded the remaining heathlands of Exmoor, for the greatest harm had been caused to lowland habitats, the Conservancy\u2019s demands remained modest. As Goode explained, the Conservancy wished to guarantee the protection of Britain\u2019s SSSIs, less than 6 per cent of the country\u2019s land, which was neither possible under existing provision nor likely under the new bill. The Conservancy sought just one extra provision, namely a mechanism to ensure that all changes \u2018detrimental to the scientific interest of any SSSI should be notified in advance to the Conservancy\u2019.[CITATION-106] An editorial inunder the heading \u2018The Disappearing Landscape\u2019 effectively argued along similar lines: the protective measures supplied by the bill should be applied to all SSSIs.[CITATION-107] Amendments attempted to give all SSSIs the status of a super-SSSI, to extend the super-SSSI provision not just to \u2018moor and heath\u2019 but any \u2018open country\u2019, and to give SSSIs the same status as a scheduled ancient monument or historic building. Further amendments tried to empower the Conservancy to request the secretary of state to make an order prohibiting a harmful agricultural operation when agreement could not be reached, and to bring agriculture and forestry under planning control by means of amending the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 (twenty-four columns of Hansard were duly filled to little discernible effect).[CITATION-108] The only successful amendment was tabled by Sandford; he caught the government unawares and it was passed by a \u2018thinly-attended\u2019 House.[CITATION-109] Sandford wanted applications for grants that were \u2018likely to affect adversely the character or amenity\u2019 of National Parks and other valuable landscapes, which would include grants for capital projects eligible under the EEC\u2019s \u2018Less Favoured Areas\u2019 Directive (1975), to be jointly considered by the Department of the Environment and MAFF. If the application was refused the National Park or other planning authority would be obliged to enter into a management agreement. It was a shrewd move. A management agreement was more likely to be agreed if the possibility that MAFF would make a ploughing grant was removed before negotiations began. By suggesting impoverished upland farmers should be supported through management agreements and grants for the development of tourist and craft industries, Sandford broke with the conventions of agricultural support\u2014grants, price support measures and subsidies\u2014that dated back to the Hill Farming Act 1946, presaging future attempts to diversify the rural economy. Equally, by highlighting the importance of vulnerable agricultural communities, without whom \u2018we should have national jungles, we should have national swamps, but we should not have national parks\u2019, Sandford avoided the negative, restrictive connotations associated with amendments tabled by critics of the bill.[CITATION-110] Sandford\u2019s amendment temporarily re-orientated the debate, generating favourable responses to the reliance it placed on local co-operation and knowledge, its recognition of the changing \u2018role of the agricultural occupant\u2019, and its determination to learn from the UK\u2019s EEC partners when considering the \u2018integrated development of upland\u2019. For some, making payments for non-agricultural uses at a time of economic contraction and widespread deprivation was questionable, but more generally Sandford\u2019s proposals focused attention on the effectiveness of the existing subsidy regime. If, as Ann-Christina Knudson argues, agricultural subsidies were a form of \u2018welfare\u2019 payment characteristic of post-war European social democracy, to opposition peers it was evident the system was no longer fit for purpose.[CITATION-111] \u2018[F]ar too much public money\u2019 went \u2018to people who do not really need it\u2019, complained Melchett, large capital grants \u2018tending to go to the richest farmers\u2019; Lord Swinton argued that struggling upland farmers had little choice but to put out more sheep and cattle, leading to overgrazing and the production of \u2018useless, white land\u2019, good only for forestry. Positive uses for public money were needed.[CITATION-112] As W.M. Adams points out, the amendment \u2018excited observers at the time because it opened the way to making MAFF manage the countryside as \u201ca socio-economic totality and not a food-factory\u201d\u2019, though few serious commentators thought the amendment would survive a whipped vote in the Commons. The warmth of the response in the Lords belied the narrowness of the decision: it had been secured by just two votes, 48 to 46.[CITATION-113] With the bill ready to pass to the Commons, the judgement ofhad it about right. The government had \u2018given away little in the long contest\u2019 even though it had \u2018scarcely had the best of the argument\u2019. Government spokesmen had effectively conceded that the powers proposed with respect to the super-SSSI ought to be applied to all SSSIs but the cost implications and fear of antagonising the farmers prevented them from accepting these amendments. Less clear was why the government had resisted the \u2018plainly essential\u2019 requirement that owners give notice of major changes to farming practices on all SSSIs.[CITATION-114] The Second Reading debate in the Commons was predictable. The government accepted no amendment that changed the \u2018fundamentals\u2019 of the bill, including any suggestion that agricultural grants might be withheld on amenity grounds; the Labour opposition found Part II of the bill inadequate and felt the secretary of state should be given reserve powers to stop any operation the Conservancy thought damaging to the \u2018special interests\u2019 of an SSSI.[CITATION-115] Party politics largely dictated the committee stage of the bill. No backbench Conservative MPs sympathetic to the conservationists were nominated by the government, ensuring that the conservation lobby was represented by opposition members and so diminishing the likelihood of a cross-party consensus.[CITATION-116] 930 amendments were duly tabled and long queues formed outside Committee Room 12; representatives of Friends of the Earth, the RSPB and the CPRE were on hand with the arguments needed to tackle ministerial claims.[CITATION-117] When, in June, Howell was mocked by acolumnist for his \u2018Domesday pronouncements\u2019 and supposed subservience to the environmental lobby, he responded with a remarkably coherent letter. The committee, he explained, had already met eighteen times and for seventy-three hours; it was likely to need a further eight sittings and twenty-seven hours of debate. Eight significant issues remained unresolved and four concerned the protection of habitat: had government-funded agricultural operations been detrimental to efforts to protect flora and fauna? What was needed with respect to the protection of habitat if the protections extended to individual plant and animal species were to be effective? Should the landowner or holder be required to notify the Conservancy of any operation that might prove harmful to a SSSI? Should the grant-aided ploughing up of critical moorland habitats be allowed to go ahead if no management agreement was reached?[CITATION-118] After months of debate, the fundamental issues remained. The dogged determination of the conservation lobby had come up against a government with a solid majority determined to get its way. Tom King, junior minister at the Department of the Environment, expressed his sympathy for the Sandford amendment, rousing hopes of a breakthrough, but the resulting government amendment only required MAFF to consider the aims of conservation \u2018in so far as may be consistent with the agricultural purposes of the scheme\u2019.[CITATION-119] Faced with yet another damning Conservancy report on damage to SSSIs and the threat by the opposition to talk the bill out, King finally made the crucial concession, adding additional new clauses to the bill. A statutory requirement would fall on the Conservancy to notify an owner or occupier when it was considering designating part of the property an SSSI; a reciprocal obligation was placed on the owner to notify the Conservancy of any plan to commence a potentially damaging operation on an SSSI. This effectively killed the super-SSSI distinction, meeting demands made months before by the Conservancy, a host of statutory and non-statutory bodies and the bill\u2019s critics in the Lords. Howell stated that this was the absolute minimum that could be accepted.[CITATION-120] Having achieved this, conservationist groups were furious when the government passed an amendment requiring that the Conservancy compensate farmers for loss of earnings if MAFF refused a grant on conservation grounds. The conservation lobby feared the amendment would disincentivise the Conservancy, creating a cost burden each time it fulfilled its statutory obligations. Robin Grove-White of the CPRE wrote sarcastically of \u2018a remarkable new principle\u2019 in which farmers would be automatically compensated for \u2018hypothetical \u201closses\u201d\u2019, a principle that applied to no other group in society; a spokesperson for the Ramblers\u2019 Association implored Heseltine to scrap this \u2018quite lunatic\u2019 clause.[CITATION-121] The Conservancy, however, supported the amendment. Later insisting it had not caved in to political pressure, the Conservancy argued that the amendment would create a financial obligation for the government and reveal the \u2018true cost of conservation\u2019.[CITATION-122] Whether capitulation or strategic ploy, the logic of the Conservancy\u2019s position was consistent\u2014conservation had to be paid for.With the bill back in the Lords, the conservation lobby made its last, futile effort to challenge the underlying principles of the bill. A cross-party amendment allowed the Conservancy or a park authority, on MAFF\u2019s refusal to pay an agricultural grant, to elect whether or not to enter into a management agreement. If they chose not to, the farmer would lose entitlement to compensation for loss of profits. Although the logic of the amendment stemmed from the need to prevent farmers from making spurious applications to MAFF in order to earn compensation from the Conservancy, and although it was endorsed by the Association of County Councils, the Countryside Commission, the Association of National Park Officers, the CPRE, the Royal Society for Nature Conservation and the Council for National Parks, government whips ensured it fell.[CITATION-123] On the eve of the passage of the bill,again took stock of the situation. It argued that the cost of compensation should fall equally on the Conservancy and MAFF, but more generally attested to the gravity of the situation. It feared a spate of new developments before the Act could take hold and it left readers in no doubt that this would be unacceptable. Quoting Heseltine to the effect that there could be no increase in the rate of development, the leader went further, arguing that \u2018the present rate would be unacceptable if it were continued\u2019. More, though, was at stake. \u2018In effect, the Bill is the last chance for the voluntary principle in agricultural planning, the last attempt to reconcile the interests of farming and conservation without prohibitions. If it fails, then the case for a measure of compulsory planning with be irresistible\u2019.[CITATION-124] In 1977, Derek Ratcliffe offered a finely balanced assessment of the performance of the British nature state. Much that he wrote anticipated the debates that animated the bill process that led to the passage of the 1981 Act. He emphasised the achievements of conservation bodies since 1949, including the relative effectiveness of the SSSI notification system, but lamented the continuing exclusion of agriculture and forestry from the planning system and insisted that the destructive force of agricultural intensification had to be recognised as a serious policy problem. He argued that farmers and foresters should recognise that they were moral actors, which for some meant forgoing profits, but he did not fundamentally challenge incentive-based approaches to mitigating environmental harm.[CITATION-125] He also recognised that the debate had been transformed by the \u2018tremendous growth of the non-official movement for nature conservation\u2019, concluding that the emphasis official bodies placed on preserving the \u2018scientific interest\u2019 of particular habitats was no longer an inadequate justification for nature conservation.[CITATION-126] In essence, Ratcliffe argued, two general principles had emerged:The first is that nature conservation is increasingly expected to support its interests with hard cash, since its gain is often someone else\u2019s financial loss; and the second is that the rationale and philosophy of nature conservation is required increasingly to be identified and justified as a valid form of public interest.[CITATION-127] If Ratcliffe was right to argue that environmentalism had made the SSSI designation an anachronistic description of the public interest in the natural environment, the 1981 Act ensured the designation remained central to nature conservation in the decades that followed. Thereafter, an SSSI designation meant MAFF would refuse grants on the recommendation of the Conservancy, which in turn could attempt to convince farmers or potential foresters to eschew \u2018potentially damaging operations\u2019 in return for a funded management agreement. And by expanding the range of flora and fauna under state protection, the Act broadened the criteria by which the Conservancy and its successors might designate an SSSI: by 1981, 3,877 sites had been notified under the 1949 provisions; by 1997, 6,249 SSSIs had been designated under the 1981 provisions.[CITATION-128] These figures suggest that the Conservancy\u2019s fear proved largely unfounded that the appeals system and interdepartmental consultation would delay, obstruct or prevent designation, though in the first years of the Act numerous SSSIs were de-notified as landowners took advantage of the three-month window of opportunity provided by the period allowed for the landowner to make representations. This loophole was closed by an amendment to the Act passed in 1985.[CITATION-129] The government had been right to predict that reciprocal notification of all SSSIs would create significant financial pressures and a barely manageable administrative burden for the Conservancy, but it underestimated the degree to which the agricultural lobby recognised that the Act had to be seen to work if the voluntary principle was to be maintained.[CITATION-130] W.M. Adams\u2019s interim report on the implementation of the Act nonetheless painted a bleak picture of a woefully under-resourced Conservancy struggling to complete the heavy labour of renotification, notification of new SSSIs, and the achievement of management agreements.[CITATION-131] It will never be known how often compensation payments were made in response to empty threats by landholders to carry out agricultural operations on SSSIs or, indeed, how far these processes were spun out by land agents whose fees were paid by the Conservancy. By the late 1990s it could be shown that the Act had prevented damaging agricultural operations on many SSSIs, but this is a strictly relative claim.[CITATION-132] Official figures from 2008 indicate that if 1960 is treated as the baseline, England\u2019s remaining semi-natural grassland with the SSSI designation did considerably better than that without, but the loss overall was 47 per cent, mainly by conversion to arable land or improved grassland, and the rate of loss did not diminish after 1981.[CITATION-133] And although something of the improved condition of SSSIs reflected European Union reforms to the system of agricultural subsidies after 1987, the sums dedicated to \u2018agri-environmental agreements\u2019 amounted to a small fraction of the payments made and ecologists judged the biodiversity gains to be \u2018underwhelming\u2019.[CITATION-134] Labour\u2019s Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 strengthened provisions, but rates of SSSI notification and effective monitoring remained dependent on the Treasury; in the 2010s, a period of Conservative-dominated coalition government and then Conservative government, very few new SSSIs were notified and monitoring of existing SSSIs was inadequate.[CITATION-135] Abigail Woods warns us against adopting reductive narratives of negative agricultural change in the post-war period, but with respect to the health of the UK flora and fauna and the functioning of its ecosystems the force of a narrative of decline is hard to contest.[CITATION-136] The 1981 Act achieved some success on its own terms, but it did not help to halt or reverse the precipitous decline of UK biodiversity. Whether evidence is taken from the government white paper of 2011 (\u2018The Natural Choice: Securing the Value of Nature\u2019) or the authoritative \u2018State of Nature\u2019 reports, the story is the same: how the UK manages its farmland (in combination with climate change) remains significantly responsible for the continuing depletion of British wildlife and biodiversity, endangering the survival of many species. Preventing certain agricultural operations on SSSIs has not reversed the overall trend and every indication suggests that this slow violence will continue into the future with baleful effects for UK wildlife and human beings alike.The paradox cannot be missed. Since 1981, state-led deindustrialisation and privatisation has made the agricultural interest relatively more dependent on the state while the gradual strengthening of the nature state, particularly in the 1990s and early 2000s, has left agriculture more domesticated than in the past. Why, then, has state intervention not had a greater effect on the health of UK habitat? This question invites no easy response, but the 1981 process demonstrated that a part of the answer must stem from the political and ideological challenge that arises from the peculiar way agriculture is at once state-supported, structured around numerous private enterprises, and essential to the health and welfare of the population. As Christopher Rodgers argues, the 1981 Act and later statutory developments did not create new forms of collective, common or communal property, for no change was made to whom had a right to make use of the land, but the Act did offer a modest challenge to conventional private property rights by effecting \u2018how, when and in what manner\u2019 some land could be used.[CITATION-137] Nonetheless, and notwithstanding the claims widely made during the process with respect to the public interest in healthy ecosystems, the new statutory provisions reflected the dominance of the proprietary interest and the ideological reluctance of the Conservative government to extend significantly the reach of the nature state at its expense.Moreover, as the implementation of the 1981 Act indicated, state-led regulatory regimes do not function as faceless bureaucratic procedures based on the objective application of statute, but are imperfect, resource-dependent processes the outcomes of which are determined by the judgements and decisions made by numerous historical actors, including politicians, civil servants, credentialed experts and members of the public. And given that the functioning of the nature state is resource-dependent, its capacity necessarily reflects government priorities and, by extension, party political interests. It is significant that Labour governments passed the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, the Countryside Act 1968, and the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, and commissioned the Porchester Report and sought to implement its findings. The Wildlife and Countryside Act therefore looks anomalous, but the protracted drafting and parliamentary process indicated that the government strove to satisfy the requirements of EEC Directives without significantly disrupting the rural propertied order. As the CLA and the NFU were reassured in private meetings, to vest powers in the minister could be a means to minimise rather than maximise the possible consequences of the legislation.It is tempting to speculate about how the Act would have been implemented or amended had Labour governments been elected in 1983, 1987 or 1992. It seems likely that the Conservancy would have faced a less hostile environment. What is known is that the heightened ideological context of the 1980s set the Conservancy and the Conservative governments on a collision course that culminated in 1989 with the Conservancy\u2019s dissolution and replacement with separate English, Welsh and Scottish agencies. Perhaps a break was inevitable. The Conservancy was characteristic of post-war statism and the \u2018centrist scientism\u2019 so disliked by the Thatcherites, but the immediate trigger was the Conservancy\u2019s unusually forthright opposition to the afforestation of the \u2018Flow Country\u2019 peatlands of Caithness and Sutherland in Scotland, reputably the UK\u2019s ecosystem least affected by human interventions. In Mark Cocker\u2019s vivid telling of the story, the lairds mobilised, celebrities exploited tax breaks offered by commercial forestry, the Conservancy embarked on a near-suicide mission, comprehensively winning the argument but sacrificing valuable political capital, and Malcolm Rifkind and Nicholas Ridley, cabinet ministers and free marketeers, exacted their vengeance on the Conservancy and let the ploughing go ahead.[CITATION-138] Central to the \u2018battle of the bogs\u2019 was the Conservancy\u2019s attempt to protect the integrity of the Flow Country ecosystem, some 1,500 square miles of terrain, rather than an exemplary selection as was usual under the SSSI system. As Conservancy scientists had long understood, the SSSI archipelago, afloat in a rising sea of chemically dependent intensive agriculture, failed to account for how healthy, interconnected ecosystems actually function.A generation later, this critique underpinned Hilary Benn\u2019s decision as Labour\u2019s secretary of state at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to launch an independent review, chaired by Sir John Lawton, of \u2018England\u2019s Wildlife Sites and Ecological Networks\u2019 in September 2009. \u2018Making Space for Nature\u2019 was a major piece of work, collating a large volume of data, and was published a year later under the new Conservative-led coalition government. Asking whether \u2018England\u2019s wildlife sites comprise a coherent and resilient ecological network\u2019, Lawton\u2019s answer was not altogether negative, but the review still made extensive, potentially transformative recommendations. The creation of \u2018wildlife corridors\u2019 should be part of an extensive programme of ecological restoration underpinned by ecological \u2018connectivity\u2019 and justified by the delivery of \u2018ecosystem services\u2019, including flood defence and carbon sequestration.[CITATION-139] The fate of Lawton\u2019s recommendations is outside the scope of this article, but the adoption of the \u2018ecosystem services\u2019 framework signalled a shift in government discourse away from an understanding of nature conservation as an inherent good towards a more politically legible, instrumentalist analysis. This development divided ecologists, but the government\u2019s proposition that farmers might be supported to deliver environmental \u2018public goods\u2019 rather than paid subsidies based on productivity informed the hope environmentalists invested in the process behind the first post-Brexit agriculture bill in 2019\u201320.[CITATION-140] By promising to replace the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) with Environmental Land Management Schemes (ELMS) as the foundation for the relationship between agriculture and the state, the Agriculture Act 2020 has the potential to expand significantly the remit of the nature state. Not since 1979\u201381 had environmentalists invested so much energy and hope in environmental legislation, evidence\u2014if evidence is needed\u2014of the continuing relationship between the health of the UK biosphere and arduous processes of Whitehall consultation, lobbying and parliamentary manoeuvre. In 1981, it took the prospect of losing the bill on procedural grounds\u2014and not the logic of argument\u2014to trigger a significant concession. As Grove-White later argued, the environmental movement\u2019s development had been limited by its necessary focus on \u2018a set of physical problems\u2019 that ensured it had to exploit \u2018small openings\u2019 in a political culture dominated by processes determined by civil servants \u2018skilled at displacing tensions rather than at addressing the substance of them\u2019.[CITATION-141] That \u2018reciprocal notification\u2019 of all SSSIs was the most remarked upon outcome of the long parliamentary process demonstrates that in 1981 the UK nature state, and the lobbying culture it engendered, remained straitjacketed by its moment of genesis in 1949, and would remain so for some time to come. Equally striking was how little attention was paid to the EEC as a prompt for the legislative process. Domestic or national political dynamics predominated, further evidence that the nature state, however cautious or contentious its ministrations, had become an integral part of UK governance."
