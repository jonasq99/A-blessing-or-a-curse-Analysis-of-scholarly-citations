Cleveland,Islam against the West: Shakib Arslan and the Campaign for Islamic Nationalism,1,"According to William Cleveland’s study of Shakib Arslan’s anti-imperialist struggle, Arslan’s sentiments were accurately reflected in the letter. Cleveland speculates, as did many of Arslan’s contemporaries, that financial distress motivated Arslan’s sudden turn to support Mussolini.1 Indeed, Arslan complained to correspondents about his finances.2 His rapprochement with Italy was a response to Mussolini’s campaign to promote Fascist ideology and pro-Italian sentiment throughout the eastern Mediterranean. To support Italian ambitions for both spiritual and material expansion, propaganda recruited local support through radio broadcasts, newspapers, student exchanges, cultivating elite support and other activities. It sought to ‘challenge the British imperial and mandatory system from within’. To that end, Italy strengthened bonds with anti-colonial movements in British and French-held territory. Although some British officials were dismissive, those who were alarmed still lacked the means to contain Italian influence.3"

Kabha,"The Palestinian Press as Shaper of Public Opinion, 1929–39: Writing up a Storm",1,"Many scholars have studied the role of the Palestinian press in national activity and factional conflict.31 Palestinian newspapers emerged from the early nationalist or proto-nationalist movement of the late Ottoman period. They were typically owned by notable families and leaned towards nationalism, but also tended to represent the specific interest of the owning family."
https://doi.org/10.1093/ehr/cead102,12,1,B. Hughes and T. Hughes,Georgian Shoe Buckles,1,"Since these narratives maintain that display was problematic for men, historians have tended to associate buckles with foppery. Buckles feature prominently in studies of the ‘macaronis’, the fashion-obsessed men named after the pasta dish that they supposedly brought back from the Grand Tour—along with other foreign styles and vices.11 The shoe historians Bernard and Therle Hughes deployed an extract from The London Spy (1698), in which city beaus wear ‘Shoes black as Jet, which shin’d by much Rubbing … displayed Buckles preserv’d bright in a Box of Cotton, that they dazzled the Eyes of each Beholder like a piece of Looking-Glass in the Sunshine’.12 This passage has been re-quoted by subsequent shoe historians, since it conveniently reinforces the image of buckles as showy and excessive, but it is in fact a misquotation: the original passage instead refers to black boots (which did not have buckles) and shiny spurs.13 The focus on foppery has obscured the extent to which buckles featured in mainstream masculine wear, and indeed could be considered manly. This article therefore re-examines the relationship between men and their buckles. It begins by exploring the history of buckles, establishing that their meanings were complex and subject to change. It then considers buckles as material artefacts, and concludes by exploring their implications for masculinity. We will see how the shoe buckle complicates our current understanding of the relationship between masculinity, effeminacy and luxury consumer goods, and furthermore that it played a role in wider shifts in the nature of social identity."

Sundquist, eds",After the Holocaust: Challenging the Myth of Silence,1,"Restoring Christian chaplains to the history of Belsen contributes to three critical areas of historical study. First, their pastoral care for survivors gives a new insight into an important aspect of the post-liberation rehabilitation of Belsen survivors and demonstrates how army chaplains adapted their understanding of their own responsibilities in such unique circumstances. The neglect of Belsen has been a significant omission in studies of army chaplaincy in the Second World War.19 Secondly, this study contributes a new understanding of Christian responses to the Holocaust, demonstrating that when Christian ministers encountered for themselves the individuals who had experienced the realities of Nazi persecution, they were more likely to comprehend the specific anti-Jewish nature of Nazi policy. Although the question of how far their understanding was disseminated is unclear, these chaplains’ responses add nuance to the conclusions of historians such as Tony Kushner and Tom Lawson, who have pointed to the example of the Church of England to conclude that the revelations from the Western concentration camps did not alter British society’s inability fully to appreciate the anti-Jewish nature of Nazi persecution.20 Finally, in analysing for the first time the written records of the chaplains themselves, this study provides new evidence of immediate post-liberation recognition of the importance of survivor testimony, challenging what David Cesarani called the ‘myth of silence’, the suggestion that survivor experience was absent from the narrative following liberation.21 In sharing testimony, some chaplains reveal a degree of sensitivity to some women’s experiences of sexual violence during the Holocaust, for example, suggesting that some chaplains understood how Nazi persecution was experienced in distinct ways by women—an aspect of the Holocaust which even in historical scholarship has only relatively recently been given due attention.22"
https://doi.org/10.1093/ehr/cead101,60,1,Reilly,Belsen,1,Contemporary narratives of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen often contained few references to Jews and Jewish experiences of persecution. Historians have explored how the context of the liberation in the last weeks before Germany’s final defeat obscured knowledge of the eastern death camps such as Auschwitz. It has been suggested that Belsen was absorbed into what was already known about pre-war camps and not understood for its place within the escalation of Nazi persecution. The extent of the horrors revealed there meant that Belsen became the ultimate evidence of the evil of Nazism. The timing of its liberation close to the end of war in Europe contributed to its swift adoption as the symbol of the British role in defeating such evil.59 Joanne Reilly has noted that few of the soldier liberators of Belsen were able to comprehend something which was so horrific and therefore they could not understand its place within anything wider that would become known as the Holocaust.60 The Jewish story was neglected.

Wright","Glasgow: High-Rise Homes, Estates and Communities in the Post-War Period",1,"As the cases, statistics and memoirs from the 1950s suggest, ongoing rationing and price control measures ensured that the market for stolen goods had not necessarily disappeared, despite the arrival of the post-1945 welfare state.130 At the same time, it may have become riskier and less profitable to deal in illicit goods as more families were relocated into new housing estates from the 1960s onwards. Charles Jenkins, born in Liverpool in 1937, described his experience of living in a terraced house in the city in 1943–4, where ‘if something got stolen, you knew who had done it’. When his family were rehoused to the city’s outskirts in the 1960s, ‘you did not know people. You did not know whether they were nice or a crook. There were different people from all over’.131 Yet Jon Lawrence has challenged the idea of community decline in post-war Britain and argues that it existed in two competing and overlapping ways, both in the mind and also as small, everyday interactions.132 Recent scholarship on flatted estates in Glasgow suggests that the impact of housing redevelopment on communities was complex. Rather than ‘the enforced communality characteristic’ of tenements, it produced new forms of relationships between neighbours that ‘were increasingly personalised and voluntaristic’.133 These new forms of community possibly undermined the structures that had allowed the buying and selling of stolen goods to take place—but we need to know more about how these new forms of housing may have facilitated different opportunities for offences by women. Wider post-war changes included an increase in the numbers of married women being employed outside the home, which perhaps also negated the need or opportunity for these kinds of offences.134 Nevertheless, criminological studies from the late 1990s note that receivers of stolen goods at that time typically sold items to close networks of friends and neighbours through pre-arranged meetings, in places considered to be private, such as the home and workplace, suggesting important similarities with the earlier practices uncovered here.135 New commercial cultures also emerged that privileged the theft of cars, televisions and money and which may have challenged women’s expertise in home-based crimes. Yet for working-class women, there may have been new opportunities to use minor crime to challenge the continued social inequities they experienced. For example, the new welfare state created different forms of fraudulent offences, perhaps especially tempting for women, particularly relating to the exploitation of Family Allowance payments, which requires further exploration."
