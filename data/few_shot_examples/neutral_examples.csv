where did George III and other members of his family stand on the
slave trade question? No clear evidence has yet come to light to trace the
views of Queen Charlotte and the princesses, other than a few examples
of pamphlets and cartoons which say more about the assumptions of
the writers and satirists than they do about the royal family. In 1792, for
example, the anonymous author of An Address to Her Royal Highness the
Dutchess of York, Against the Use of Sugar appealed to the assumed maternal
instincts of the newly married duchess by asking her to imagine
the suffering of thousands of infants separated from their parents.82
The central appeal of the Address focused on persuading her to convince
her ‘Royal Consort’, the Duke of York, to oppose the slave trade.
It also claimed that her example as an ‘amiable daughter-in-law’ would
persuade George III and Queen Charlotte to discourage a ‘villainous
trade, by rejecting the produce of it’. The pamphlet concluded with
flattery, telling the duchess that if she helped Africans in this way, songs would be composed in her honour as ‘the guardian angel of Africa’.83
As the couple separated several years later, her anticipated influence
was entirely imaginary.84 This lack of direct of evidence for the views
of women at court is not to suggest that they were unaware of, or uninterested
in, this debate; as Madeleine Pelling and Karin Wulf have
recently noted, the court of Queen Charlotte included ‘accomplished,
intellectually curious, and literary women’.85"

Vaughan,The Politics of Empire at the Accession of George III: The East India Company and the Crisis and Transformation of Britain’s Imperial State,0,"To scholars of empire, it seems unfathomable that British historians can still talk about constitutional change in Britain as if it were not involved in the governance of millions of souls across the seas. In some respects, however, this myopia is reasonable. Parliamentarians argued much more about the Corn Laws or Catholic emancipation than they did about Crown rule or even slavery in the empire. In any case, as has been recently pointed out, the narrow gaze of scholars working on the intricate pathways of politics in Britain is reciprocated.108 Despite more than a decade passing since the pioneering work of Zoë Laidlaw and Alan Lester, many scholars of empire still ignore the fact that the domestic political landscape had an impact on their concerns.109 To employ Tony Ballantyne’s metaphor, they write about webs of empire without paying due attention to the spider at its centre.110"
