where did George III and other members of his family stand on the
slave trade question? No clear evidence has yet come to light to trace the
views of Queen Charlotte and the princesses, other than a few examples
of pamphlets and cartoons which say more about the assumptions of
the writers and satirists than they do about the royal family. In 1792, for
example, the anonymous author of An Address to Her Royal Highness the
Dutchess of York, Against the Use of Sugar appealed to the assumed maternal
instincts of the newly married duchess by asking her to imagine
the suffering of thousands of infants separated from their parents.82
The central appeal of the Address focused on persuading her to convince
her ‘Royal Consort’, the Duke of York, to oppose the slave trade.
It also claimed that her example as an ‘amiable daughter-in-law’ would
persuade George III and Queen Charlotte to discourage a ‘villainous
trade, by rejecting the produce of it’. The pamphlet concluded with
flattery, telling the duchess that if she helped Africans in this way, songs would be composed in her honour as ‘the guardian angel of Africa’.83
As the couple separated several years later, her anticipated influence
was entirely imaginary.84 This lack of direct of evidence for the views
of women at court is not to suggest that they were unaware of, or uninterested
in, this debate; as Madeleine Pelling and Karin Wulf have
recently noted, the court of Queen Charlotte included ‘accomplished,
intellectually curious, and literary women’.85","Citation:

First, their pastoral care for survivors gives a new insight into an important aspect of the post-liberation rehabilitation of Belsen survivors and demonstrates how army chaplains adapted their understanding of their own responsibilities in such unique circumstances. The neglect of Belsen has been a significant omission in studies of army chaplaincy in the Second World War.19 Secondly, this study contributes a new understanding of Christian responses to the Holocaust, demonstrating that when Christian ministers encountered for themselves the individuals who had experienced the realities of Nazi persecution, they were more likely to comprehend the specific anti-Jewish nature of Nazi policy. Although the question of how far their understanding was disseminated is unclear, these chaplains’ responses add nuance to the conclusions of historians such as Tony Kushner and Tom Lawson, who have pointed to the example of the Church of England to conclude that the revelations from the Western concentration camps did not alter British society’s inability fully to appreciate the anti-Jewish nature of Nazi persecution.20 Finally, in analysing for the first time the written records of the chaplains themselves, this study provides new evidence of immediate post-liberation recognition of the importance of survivor testimony, challenging what David Cesarani called the ‘myth of silence’, the suggestion that survivor experience was absent from the narrative following liberation.21 In sharing testimony, some chaplains reveal a degree of sensitivity to some women’s experiences of sexual violence during the Holocaust, for example, suggesting that some chaplains understood how Nazi persecution was experienced in distinct ways by women—an aspect of the Holocaust which even in historical scholarship has only relatively recently been given due attention.22","Citation:

Lord Liverpool and Liberal Toryism, 1820–1827

Footnote:
On the question of the relationship between Liverpool’s ministry and liberalism, a foundational work is W.R. Brock, Lord Liverpool and Liberal Toryism, 1820–1827 (2nd edn, London, 1967). Brock’s link between liberal Toryism and classical political economy has been extensively questioned by Boyd Hilton’s emphasis on evangelicalism, most especially in B. Hilton, The Age of Atonement: The Influence of Evangelicalism on Social and Economic Thought, 1795–1865 (Oxford, 1988); and with some adjustments in B. Hilton, A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People? England, 1783–1846 (Oxford, 2006). For an alternative view, see N. Gash, review of Hilton, Age of Atonement, in English Historical Review, civ (1989), pp. 136–40; N. Gash, Lord Liverpool: The Life and Political Career of Robert Banks Jenkinson, Second Earl of Liverpool, 1770–1828 (London, 1984); and N. Gash, Aristocracy and People: Britain, 1815–1865 (Cambridge, MA, 1979). An astute assessment of the tactical deployment of Liberal Tory ideas and their relation to economic reform can be found in P. Harling, The Waning of ‘Old Corruption’: The Politics of Economical Reform in Britain, 1779–1846 (Oxford, 1996). John Derry gives a lucid overview of the period, and rightly emphasises Liverpool’s pragmatism in Politics in the Age of Fox, Pitt and Liverpool (London, 1990). S.M. Lee, George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827 (Suffolk, 2008) emphasises both the particularity of this early nineteenth-century moment and frames the division between High and Liberal Tories as a spectrum rather than a simple binary. S.P. Lamont’s ‘Robert Wilmot Horton and Liberal Toryism’ (Univ. of Nottingham Ph.D. thesis, 2015) is a rare example of the scholarship’s engagement with empire.

Wright","Glasgow: High-Rise Homes, Estates and Communities in the Post-War Period",0,"As the cases, statistics and memoirs from the 1950s suggest, ongoing rationing and price control measures ensured that the market for stolen goods had not necessarily disappeared, despite the arrival of the post-1945 welfare state.130 At the same time, it may have become riskier and less profitable to deal in illicit goods as more families were relocated into new housing estates from the 1960s onwards. Charles Jenkins, born in Liverpool in 1937, described his experience of living in a terraced house in the city in 1943–4, where ‘if something got stolen, you knew who had done it’. When his family were rehoused to the city’s outskirts in the 1960s, ‘you did not know people. You did not know whether they were nice or a crook. There were different people from all over’.131 Yet Jon Lawrence has challenged the idea of community decline in post-war Britain and argues that it existed in two competing and overlapping ways, both in the mind and also as small, everyday interactions.132 Recent scholarship on flatted estates in Glasgow suggests that the impact of housing redevelopment on communities was complex. Rather than ‘the enforced communality characteristic’ of tenements, it produced new forms of relationships between neighbours that ‘were increasingly personalised and voluntaristic’.133 These new forms of community possibly undermined the structures that had allowed the buying and selling of stolen goods to take place—but we need to know more about how these new forms of housing may have facilitated different opportunities for offences by women. Wider post-war changes included an increase in the numbers of married women being employed outside the home, which perhaps also negated the need or opportunity for these kinds of offences.134 Nevertheless, criminological studies from the late 1990s note that receivers of stolen goods at that time typically sold items to close networks of friends and neighbours through pre-arranged meetings, in places considered to be private, such as the home and workplace, suggesting important similarities with the earlier practices uncovered here.135 New commercial cultures also emerged that privileged the theft of cars, televisions and money and which may have challenged women’s expertise in home-based crimes. Yet for working-class women, there may have been new opportunities to use minor crime to challenge the continued social inequities they experienced. For example, the new welfare state created different forms of fraudulent offences, perhaps especially tempting for women, particularly relating to the exploitation of Family Allowance payments, which requires further exploration.","Citation:
