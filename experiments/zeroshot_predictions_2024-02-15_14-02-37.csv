Nicolas Mariot’s recent study of the frontline encounter between intellectuals and working-class soldiers illustrates the perils of such confusion. Mariot sets out to challenge the idea that the experience of combat had welded estranged social groups into a frontline community. To do so, he relies on the testimonies of combatant intellectuals to argue that the resilience of working-class and rural soldiers cannot be taken as evidence of patriotism. Mariot underlines the incapacity of rank-and-file participants to express their commitment to national defence in the idealistic terms favoured by intellectuals and nationalists. This, in his view, demonstrates the irrelevance of patriotism as an interpretative factor.[CITATION-16]","Mariot, Tous unis dans la tranchée?.

It also highlights the ethical dimensions of the process of patriotic mobilisation and finally underlines the specificities of urban wartime politics.The intensity of the historiographical dispute over the French war effort in 1914–18 has obscured the fact that protagonists on both sides of the argument paradoxically share what one may call—for lack of a better term—a ‘consensualist’ view of wartime mobilisation. Indeed, the idea that wartime mobilisation stemmed from theand from a rather improbable national consensus remains surprisingly prevalent across the divide drawn by the controversy.

Both sides in this debate also inadvertently conspire to neglect patriotism as a category of political analysis.

He dismisses the language of patriotism as simply an expression of social conformity in a time of censorship and propaganda; however, one could argue that this overstates the efficiency of the state’s police apparatus. It also suppresses the voices of subaltern participants in the conflict or, at best, suggests they would better be disregarded as insincere and therefore useless as historical sources.[CITATION-18]","Rousseau, 14–18, penser le patriotisme, pp. 47, 51, 64, 79.",1

It is indeed striking to see how the centenary of the war and the flurry of activities, events and publications it generated, reactivated conventional as well as regional narratives of victimisation. These also built on and appropriated the kind of rhetoric deployed by those activists and intellectuals who have rightly been calling for France to reckon with the crimes and moral legacies of its imperialist ventures.[MASK] Like those who legitimately agitate for the integration of colonial soldiers into the national memory of the war, regionalist writers have evoked soldiers of Languedoc, Corsica, Brittany or the Basque country as sacrificial victims of the French centralising and nationalising project.[MASK] In this regard, France is just another example of a multicultural society grappling with the memory of wars fought in the name of the nation-state. Yet, historians of the Breton or southern experiences of the war also lend credence to such regionalist interpretations when they appear to endorse theas an ideal-type of national mobilisation.[MASK] This article draws on a rich scholarly field in which historians of the urban experience of the war have, over the last two decades, framed their contributions in both local and comparative terms.[MASK] It also builds on the studies of wartime urban governance published in the inter-war period under the aegis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.[MASK] As we shall see, urban history does indeed underline the conflictual nature of social mobilisation for war and demonstrates that theis a poor descriptor for that process. For local social movements and conflicts did not merely demonstrate the frailty of the consensus stipulated by the prescriptions of nationalism. Instead, urban contention constituted a critical mediation of the war experience, whereby national and infra-national identities were asserted, mobilised and played out on the urban stage. Urban civil societies thus ensured, to a large extent, the success of national mobilisation in France. It is also at the urban level that the contingent, ongoing and contested nature of these mobilisations appears most clearly. To look at the urban therefore sheds critical light on both the nature and mobilisation of patriotic cultures in First World War France.By adopting this local focus—on Béziers—we can document the significance of infra-national identities and repertoires of contention in enough detail to scrutinise the articulation of urban, regional and national processes of mobilisation. This question of differing scales of analysis is relevant to the study of all belligerent societies. It is, however, of particular importance for historians of the French Third Republic (1871–1940), whose source base reflects, and is determined by, the political structures of this monist and universalist political regime. As a result, histories of France have often echoed and reinforced the political hierarchy and cultural distinctions that the centralised Republic conventionally made between the nation, theand the localities and municipalities. For all their richness, departmental studies rely on sources produced by and for the prefectoral administration which held authority over all civilian functionaries in the area.[CITATION-27]","An excellent example, focusing on the Isère département, is P.J.

Weber,"Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1870–1914",1,"in Béziers was typical of the, a large swathe of the southern part of France where an advanced form of radical republicanism held sway and where socialism and syndicalism had both developed precociously. Béziers, in particular, was a secularist stronghold where local progressives celebrated a tradition of opposition to the centralised state, exemplified in the resistance of the town and the surrounding villages to the 1851 coup which had inaugurated the Second Empire. Violently repressed by troops loyal to Louis Napoléon Bonaparte, this uprising ended with the deaths of seventy people in the streets of Béziers and the deportation and execution of a number of activists. By the turn of the century, however, the local Radical Party, supported by the influential Masonic lodges, illustrated the conservative evolution of the regime: the party now became identified with the middle and upper-middle classes and the established political and social order. The town’s(MP), Louis Lafferre (1861–1929) embodied what many deemed to be the drift to the right of the Radical Party he had co-founded in 1901. Lafferre could nonetheless rely on the staunch militant secularism of many of his constituents to thwart the rising Socialist challenge. A growing presence in the associational landscape, the Socialists had adopted an idiosyncratic positioning, determined by the local socio-economic conditions. In fact, up until the 1920s, the structure of landownership in the area hampered the development of a truly collectivist and revolutionary programme, for most agricultural labourers also enjoyed the benefits of private ownership.These socio-economic characteristics accounted for the evolution and balance of the local political forces. In 1907, the crisis had revealed that territorial forms of identities were not simply defined by geography and community life, but by a common dependence on the winemaking industry. As a result, the revolt of thepitted the populations of the south against the government and forced a redefinition of political allegiances in town and countryside alike. Though Lafferre’s parliamentary seat in Béziers remained safe, a group of independent radicals and socialists standing for ‘communal interests’ defeated his allies in the subsequent municipal elections. Meanwhile, right-wing organisations in Béziers were so weak that they teetered on the brink of irrelevance. The reaction of their mouthpiece,, to the election of the Socialist Édouard Barthe in the town’s second constituency shows that, by 1914, the defence of the wine industry had become the over-arching principle around which local political life revolved. Despite its staunch Catholicism and virulent anti-republicanism,could not help paying tribute to Barthe, whom it judged had ‘the right to be proud of [his] success, for one must admit that he ensured it through his boundless dedication to the cause of winemaking’.[MASK] Eugen Weber’s classic work on late nineteenth-century France likened the means by which the masses were transformed into the French nation to a process of colonisation:We are talking about the process of acculturation: the civilization of the French by urban France, the disintegration of local cultures by modernity and their absorption into the dominant civilization of Paris and the schools.[CITATION-34]","E.

As critical of his commanders as most other, he resented any infringement of the equality among combatants. In September 1917, he wrote to the Socialistof Béziers to protest the implementation of furlough policies, underlining the paradoxical persistence, in a war for ‘Right and Justice’, of inequalities in the treatment of soldiers.[MASK] In his first wartime letter, written to his parents on 1 August 1914—‘a fateful time, an anxious time, a criminal moment’—Crassous harboured no illusion about a war which would bring about ‘the most awful atrocities, the cruellest sufferings’. Yet he went on to express his hope that it might ‘bring about eternal Peace and the welfare of humankind’. Crassous here echoed the majority of French Socialists who had resigned themselves to war, in the hope that the defeat of German militarism would consolidate and spread social democracy across Europe.[MASK] In another letter sent on 9 March 1915, he castigated ‘those damned Boches, whose might and atrocities cannot hide’ their precarious military position. Keen to reassure his parents, he exhorted them to ‘trust in the future, so we will have the joy to see each other again in perfect health’.[MASK] Yet his letters and diaries also reveal a more personal and indeed mundane vision of the war: ‘A thousand farewells with hope of return, for I leave happy to be defending your persons, your property’, he wrote.[MASK] Notwithstanding his ideological understanding of the war, Crassous clearly construed it as a defensive conflict. At stake was not just the future of the Republic and of progressive politics, but the safety of his own family and home. Indeed, Crassous saw the war primarily through the conventional lenses of class, occupation and local identity. Fighting in Champagne in the fall of 1915, the wine-grower took the time to remark on the grape harvest in the region and defied the military curfew to pick a few of those grapes.[MASK] In Greece and then in Serbia, he reported on the state of vineyards as he fought, in foreign lands, to safeguard the.[MASK] Interestingly, and despite his gruelling experience of war on the Western Front, Crassous resented even more his time in south-eastern Europe and longed to ‘live again under the beautiful sun of the’.[MASK] As the arrival of a new major appeared to raise his morale, he expressed his ‘desire’ to ‘spend the grape-harvest at home’, for the first time in four long years.[MASK] On 29 August 1919, the last entry in his war diary succinctly noted his return home, where many, including his parents, had started another harvest.Understated and construed through class and local identities, Crassous’s undeniable patriotism largely eschewed the language of nationalism. His diaries and letters illustrate a point made by Pierre Sorlin on the basis of a sophisticated discourse analysis. Despite the talent of its publicists and its capacity to whip up political controversies, the French nationalist movement largely failed to impose its language and concepts in early twentieth-century France.[CITATION-73]","P.

There is no need for a detailed prosopography of urban elites to note the pre-eminence of teachers, lawyers and other professionals among the leadership of war-related charities. The Committee for the Relief of Wounded Soldiers of Béziers does nonetheless offer a salient example of the dynamic at work here. Formed on the initiative of the Deputy Prefect to meet a need that the state could not, this private association was led by individuals who had been selected by the town’s military authorities. They included prominent wine-growers (Cadenat, Viennet) and medical professionals (Dr Roger), while a local barrister, Ricateau, was the chairman. The over-representation of traditional republican elites was simply reinforced by the structures of military recruitment. The Parrains de l’arrondissement de Béziers, the organisation dedicated to local prisoners of war previously mentioned, originated in working-class and socialist milieus, which accounted for the social diversity of its leadership. By 1917, its takeover by middle-class professionals reflected in no small part the impact of conscription. Socialist organisations simply no longer had enough members to keep it running.The unitary republican state could therefore give pluralism its chance since military mobilisation had,, transformed urban political sociology and all but eliminated oppositional groups and activists. The social and political proximity between these urban elites and the upper echelons of the state administration accounts for the latitude granted to voluntary organisations by the prefectoral administration.

The historiographical debate over ‘war culture’ remains oddly detached from wider scholarly discussions over nationhood and nationalism. It also suffers from a common and detrimental conflation of patriotism and nationalism, even in the ‘banal’ forms that Michael Billig deconstructed so effectively. Nationalism invokes an ideological coherence as well as the systematic primacy of the nation. It fails to offer an account of the characteristics of patriotism. Billig’s critical work also ignores the potential of patriotism to sustain social mobilisation against the state.[MASK] Indeed, as this article has argued, the mobilisation of urban and peripheral identities did not necessarily set them in a collision course with national mobilisation, even when protesters took on state authorities. In fact, the experience of Béziers and southern France suggest that the resilience of the national polity proceeded from the capacity of the French political system to accommodate such assertions of local identity. The relationship between the national centre and the urban and regional peripheries was one of collaboration and integration as well as one of resistance and open conflicts. For patriotism was, and should be, understood in both an anthropological and legal-political sense, as a performance of solidarity to kith and kin; as a performance of loyalty to an imagined community of fellow citizens.

The success of wartime national mobilisation did not rest on an improbable national consensus, but on the capacity of patriots of all hues to reconcile their diverging understandings of the national project to defend the existence of the nation-state. In this context, social movements performed a critical role, allowing social groups to assert the condition of their participation to the war effort. As the urban history of the First World War enjoys a revival, the approach adopted in our study of southern France demonstrates that the belligerent communities both relied on and transformed the multi-layered social fabric that tied individuals and groups to the imagined national community. In France, the process of mobilisation hinged on urban and infra-national solidarities that did not undermine the war effort but ultimately reinforced the resilience of the belligerent nation at large. Pluralism was indeed key to the success of French national mobilisation during the First World War.The victory of the Allied coalition in 1918 vindicated patriotic mobilisation and safeguarded the French Republic and its national sovereignty. Yet the economic and social dislocations of the inter-war period soon reopened the debate over the legitimacy of the Republic.

Here in its offices, the Royal Insurance Company () signed a marine insurance policy with the Royal Marble Company (). Through this policy, the Royal Insurance Company agreed to reimburse the Royal Marble Company up to 16,000 livres tournois if the, or the Carrara marble with which it was loaded, was damaged or lost in the course of its voyage from Genoa to Le Havre in northern France.[MASK] When thewas seized in England at the outset of the so-called Glorious Revolution, this ordinary transaction became the subject of a most extraordinary conflict. This article analyses the conflict, piecing together evidence from the extant registers of the Royal Insurance Company, the records of Paris’s admiralty court and other archival sources in England and France.[MASK] In analysing the tentative resolution to this messy conflict, the article makes a key contribution to the study of early modern insurance. While the field has witnessed a recent renaissance, France has not yet reaped the benefits.[MASK] The article thus offers the first close study of the Royal Insurance Company in over seventy-five years, and for the first time sketches the conflict resolution system for insurance disputes in Paris after the promulgation of theof 1681.[MASK] In so doing, the article draws on, and offers empirical support for, recent analytical works on mercantile conflict resolution and management in pre-modern Europe.[MASK] This is especially valuable in the light of the paucity of sources at the historian’s disposal for studying the multi-institutional nature of early modern insurance conflicts.Nevertheless, while the article revolves around an insurance conflict, its central focus is on what this conflict reveals about royal companies in France and their function in serving state interests. The nature of the state’s intervention into the dispute sheds light on the limited life cycle of the companies, which were conceived of and treated as tools of risk management for the state in spaces where it was weak, thereby existing and functioning ‘in the absence rather than the dominance of the state’.[MASK] Here, I quote Philip Stern, who used this phrase in reference to the English East India Company, whose privileges were justified by the fact that they operated in distant lands where the state itself could not maintain a presence.

Although surprisingly little has been written about it, the Royal Insurance Company was entirely typical of the privileged corporate model exploited by the French state in the 1680s.[MASK] It was the pet project of Jean-Baptiste Antoine Colbert, marquis de Seignelay, who succeeded his famous father as secretary of state for maritime affairs () in 1683.[MASK] Following in his father’s footsteps—Colbert had created an ill-fated insurance chamber in Paris in 1668—Seignelay established the Royal Insurance Company in 1686 with the intention of challenging the dominance of Amsterdam’s and London’s markets, at the same time as reducing the outflow of specie from France in premiums in a period where coinage was in short supply.[MASK] He also hoped the Royal Insurance Company’s conduct would serve as a model for underwriters across France, thereby addressing prevailing fears of moral hazard in the insurance industry.[MASK] Seignelay had restructured the French East India Company () and created the Guinea Company () in 1685 to encourage small groups of wealthyto invest in the state’s commercial projects. A‘was any person who handled the king’s money’, but many were close allies of the Crown who were essential in supporting the public debt, especially in times of war, through their services as tax farmers.[MASK] Following the model of these companies, Seignelay encouraged thirty, royal allies and notable merchants to invest a total of 300,000 livres in the Royal Insurance Company. Five of these shareholders were selected to serve as directors at any one time, being replaced in a fixed pattern every six months. These directors handled the company’s activities, agreeing and signing insurance policies on behalf of all the shareholders, who shared any profits or losses with the directors equally.[MASK] Among the shareholders was Jean-Baptiste de Lagny, who had been appointed by Seignelay as director general of commerce () in 1686. Lagny had extensive ties to royal finance, and served as a general farmer for the state from 1680 onwards.[MASK] Profit was not the central motivation for those who joined. As part of the institution’s letters patent, Seignelay presented shareholders with a suite of privileges: most significantly, they were given priority in filling vacancies in the directorship of the French East India Company, and a company shareholder was chosen every two years to serve as a judge on Paris’s prestigious merchant court.[MASK] The social, commercial and legal privileges of membership meant, to quote David Bien, that ‘the return was a different kind, one measured not in money but in the psychic satisfaction found in enhanced social standing’ and access to networks of royal patronage.[MASK] In the same vein, the Royal Marble Company was established as part of the French state’s broader strategy of challenging Dutch supremacy in the provisioning of marble to northern Europe.[CITATION-25]","I have only found discussion of the Royal Marble Company in an excellent article by Geneviève Bresc-Bautier, to which I am indebted: G.

This was the ‘institutionalisation of arbitration’ in action.[MASK] The procedure for resolving insurance conflicts, as outlined in the 1681.In keeping with this procedure, Jagault wrote to the Royal Marble Company on 30 April, informing the partners that the Royal Insurance Company recognised no responsibility for the loss and would present their reasoning before arbiters. The company named Claude Villain as their arbiter and invited the partners of the Royal Marble Company to choose an arbiter in turn. Accepting this invitation, the partners announced their choice on 6 May: none other than Jacques Savary. Savary was perhaps the most famous merchant in Europe during the late seventeenth century, as the author of, ‘the most reprinted, translated, and plagiarised merchant manual of early modern Europe’.[MASK] It was at this point that the conflict grew out of control. On 14 May, the Royal Insurance Company demanded that the Royal Marble Company name ‘another arbiter thanSavary, who is not of the quality required’ by the Royal Insurance Company’s letters patent.[MASK] Now 66 years old, Savary was, it seems, no longer a practising merchant, which disqualified him from serving as an arbiter in the case. The Royal Marble Company took poorly to this demand, and chose to escalate the dispute immediately, eschewing the procedure outlined by the. The very same day, the partners petitioned Paris’s admiralty court to judge the dispute. It agreed to do so, with proceedings noted on 27 May and 6 June that produced no clear result. On 20 June, the Royal Insurance Company submitted its choice of Claude Villain as arbiter to the court and asked that, in express conformity with theand the Royal Insurance Company’s letters patent, the Royal Marble Company be compelled to follow suit and settle the dispute through arbitration instead of through the court.[MASK] Apparently, the court did not agree to this. Instead, it passed judgment on the case before it between 20 and 26 June.[MASK] Not simply finding in favour of the Royal Marble Company, the court submitted the directors of the Royal Insurance Company tothat is, they were sentenced to be imprisoned until the debt was paid in full. This was the ultimate violation of the Royal Insurance Company’s letters patent, which held that the directors would never be held personally liable for the Royal Insurance Company’s debts. The company was an explicitly unlimited liability institution, meaning that all its shareholders were liable for any losses (in proportion to their investment) once its funds were depleted, but directors were expressly accorded no further responsibility for any debts in their capacity as directors.[MASK] Ron Harris has recently argued that shareholder liability was not expressly delineated by corporations before the period 1780–1830 because the circumstances did not exist for this to be necessary.[CITATION-58]","R.

71,1.0,Rossi,England 1523–1601,1,"directors’ argument was that war had been declared by Louis XIV on 26 November, the same day as thedocked in Dartmouth, but the Royal Marble Company only paid the augmented premium on 4 December. This was ample time, through the application of the ‘league-and-a-half per hour’ rule, for the news of thefate to have reached Montgrand in Le Havre, to be then transmitted to Paris.Sadly, the calculation they presented to the arbiters is not spelled out. Nevertheless, we can make our own estimate. Let us presume that thewas seized as late as the evening of 27 November. Dartmouth is 50 nautical leagues from Le Havre, and Le Havre is 65 nautical leagues from Paris by river, making a total of 115 nautical leagues.[MASK] In applying the ‘league-and-a-half per hour’ rule, knowledge of the’s loss would have been presumed to have reached Paris late on the evening of 30 November (see).A visualisation of the movement of information, as conceptualised in thedispute.Of course, this is only an estimate. Yet even if we allow a degree of leeway and suppose that the news of the’s loss was predicted to have reached Paris as late as midday on 1 December, this was still three days before the augmented premium was paid. In applying the rule, the directors argued they were not liable for payment.Could the analogy between the policy and the war clause be sustained? The directors no doubt insisted that it must. The original policy, the directors suggested, did not include the risks of war unless the augmented premium was paid—that is, to use a common characterisation in the early modern insurance industry, the insurance policy was analogous to a sales contract. With the war clause, the directors argued that the risks of war remained the Royal Marble Company’s property until the augmented premium was paid: it was only then, they suggested, that ownership of war risks was transferred to the Royal Insurance Company.[MASK] In drawing on these articles from the, the company was suggesting that the payment on the war clause was a new transaction—essentially, a new policy entailing a new transfer of risk to the insurer. As a result, the ‘league-and-a-half per hour’ rule had to be applied.This argument was built on legitimate concerns. The directors no doubt emphasised that, if the arbiters rejected their reasoning, the marine insurance industry itself would suffer: when war clauses were used, policyholders would be disposed to wait for news of any loss before paying the augmented premium. Insurers would thus become victims of moral hazard, receiving augmented premiums only from policyholders with losses to claim. In an industry where profit margins were slim—and losses were especially common when war broke out—insurers would simply try to exclude war risks through policy clauses or withdraw from the market entirely.[MASK] To adapt an observation made by Guido Rossi, the rules of the game needed to favour insurers here rather than policyholders, or else insurance risked becoming untenable in times of political uncertainty—just when it was needed most.[CITATION-71]","Rossi, ‘England 1523–1601’, p. 143.",1

She traces how Young, his sociologist collaborators at the Institute of Community Studies, and his contacts in the Labour Party, utilised various social-scientific ideas concerning the family and individual psychology to develop a ‘model of socialist citizenship, solidarity and community’.[MASK] This is a highly illuminating intellectual history, which stresses the fluidity of left thought in this period and reinforces existing depictions of Young as an important ideological gatekeeper for the British left through the mid-twentieth century.[MASK] This article, however, contends that the origins of this pluralistic tradition have longer roots, and can be viewed within a slightly different context. It argues that, before mainstream Labour figures developed their libertarian and communitarian approaches to planning in the 1940s, a range of non-aligned left thinkers were articulating similar ideas within the intellectually febrile milieu of the interwar Popular Front. Michael Young, as he acknowledged in his 1956 pamphlet, was part of this moment: he followed what has been described as the British left’s ‘Marxist turn’ in the 1930s by joining the Holborn branch of the Communist Party and engaging in Labour left activism as president of the London School of Economics Socialist Society.[MASK] But Young also broke quite soon with such party-political commitments. He left these roles in the later 1930s, instead dedicating himself to the study of working-class life through forms of social observation that were not directly connected to party politics. This was not a lone journey, but one that was in fact taken by an important group of thinkers examined in this study. I trace how their adoption of a consciously unaligned ‘left’ position in the late 1930s brought them into contact with a range of heterodox influences earlier than those who remained active within party structures, and led them to devise a politics devoted primarily to understanding the lives of ordinary people through sociological study.Crucial to this moment was the social-research organisation Mass-Observation (M-O), formed in 1937. Historians have variously examined M-O’s aesthetic, sociological, literary and artistic influences.[CITATION-17]","For the best major works on Mass-Observation in these various contexts, see B.

His work was influenced by I.A. Richards, his tutor at the University of Cambridge, and T.S. Eliot, who acted for a while as his artistic patron. Madge was also involved in the world of British Surrealism, and helped to organise the 1936 Surrealist Exhibition in London. More mundanely, he had worked as a journalist for thein the early 1930s,[MASK] and Madge recalled with fondness the idiosyncratic insights into popular culture which this role had granted him. These cumulative aesthetic and professional influences, each of them concerned with the irreverence and ‘magic’ to be found within everyday life, ensured that Madge’s political outlook was always much more flexible and amenable to the realm of culture than the ‘Stalinist orthodoxy’ of which he and his CPGB comrades have been accused.[MASK] Crucially, his relatively unique intellectual formation also led him to be more interested in understanding the mediated forms of culture found within capitalist society than many of hiscolleagues.Over the course of the 1930s Madge grew increasingly dissatisfied with the rather impressionistic depictions of working-class life given by other Popular Front thinkers. This was best illustrated by another of Madge’s interventions in thedebates, his submission to C. Day Lewis’s(1937). This volume was effectively an extendedmanifesto. It featured work by the writers Edgell Rickword, Arthur Calder-Marshall, Edward Upward and Rex Warner, as well as by J.D. Bernal, the socialist scientist, and the Marxist art historian Anthony Blunt.[MASK] Madge’s article, ‘Press, Radio, and Social Consciousness’, had already appeared in a slightly modified form in.[MASK] What marked it out from the other contributions was its approach to issues of culture. Day Lewis had cast the creative tools needed to challenge the capitalist order in classically bourgeois terms. He poured scorn on theatre and cinema. These were ‘ludicrously trivial’ and ‘fatuously pretentious’ mystifications produced to dupe the masses.[MASK] As Rex Warner stated, it was the ‘Enlightenment’ values of art, literature, and poetry that should be mobilised to write about everyday life.[MASK] Madge, however, rejected this formula. He believed that ‘high culture’, and in particular fiction, could only offer ‘an escape into the worlds of wish-fulfilment’.[MASK] Working-class people simply preferred other things; and their culture should thus be examined on its own terms.To this end, Madge and his new M-O colleagues began engaging with social-scientific ideas. M-O’s first publication, which also came out in 1937, featured a section detailing a range of social-psychological, sociological and anthropological ‘best works’ from which left thinkers could purportedly learn. These included studies carried out by Political and Economic Planning (PEP), The Pilgrim Trust, the Chicago School of sociology, Oscar Oeser’s Social Psychology research group at the University of St Andrews, and the New Fabian Research Bureau.[MASK] There was extended discussion of Robert and Helen Lynd’s Middletown study of Muncie, Indiana, in which the Lynds had employed anthropological, ethnographic and journalistic techniques to probe the ‘average’ American experience of twentieth-century life.[CITATION-34]","R.S.

If and when the subject of female participation is broached, it is concluded that women were little involved in public acts of dissent in England.[MASK] For example, Samuel Cohn found that ‘women, far from being the principal participants in later medieval protest, were remarkable for their absence’.[MASK] Where historians do find women at the centre of civil unrest, they explain their presence away.[CITATION-8]","Some recent strides have been made with regard to women’s involvement in protests in Europe, in particular J.

Their quarrel with the royal household pertained to the ‘private sphere’, without wider political significance.[MASK] By contrast, when late medieval or early modern men were involved, modern commentators decide that they spoke for a ‘common good’, and devote considerable interpretative energies to deciphering what spurred them into action, seeing—for instance—a wealth of meaning in protests about poverty, inequality or evil counsel.[MASK] The operative logic is that women can speak only for themselves, men for others.

Occasionally, chronicle narratives provide evidence of women’s involvement where it is lacking in commission letters. On 7 January 1401, a commission of oyer and terminer was sent to Bristol ‘to enquire about all treasons, insurrections, rebellions, conventicles and unlawful congregations’ relating to a refusal by the city to pay tax still owing from Richard II’s reign.[MASK] As with so many commissions, there is no indicator of the demography of the crowd. Yet Adam Usk, writing contemporaneously, records:On 1 May, in the middle of the market place at Norton St Philip, the drapers killed some of the King’s servants who had arrived bearing royal letters and demanding from them a tax … At Bristol, the wives undertook this task on behalf of their husbands, exchanging blows with another group of tax-collectors during a similar skirmish.[MASK] This is no exaggeration on the part of the chronicler: the indictments also indicate a majority female crowd comprised of the wives of drapers and merchants.[MASK] In his discussion of this case, the Victorian scholar James Wylie described the collectors as being ‘driven off, the women taking part in the fighting’.[MASK] The passive ‘driven off’ here implies the presence of another, male, group. The crowd thus becomes male by default, rendering the women a mildly diverting side-detail. This is replicated in Chris Given-Wilson’s relation of the same episode, where the riot is called the act of ‘citizens of Bristol’, and their gender relegated to a footnote.[MASK] A lack of gender indication should not be read as meaning ‘men’: we cannot simply assume either that a crowd was normally male, or that female crowds were considered exceptional.[MASK] We simply do not know how often neutral abstractions mask female, or indeed male, participation.An example from Henbury, Gloucestershire, is revealing. A predominantly female crowd of around 120 people besieged Robert Pers in 1525 when he attempted to enter two messuages and a half yardland he had bought for an exceptionally low fine of 300. Fourteen women were indicted for riot and other misdemeanours before the Gloucestershire justices of the peace. Of these, five were subsequently mentioned by Pers in his bill of complaint to Star Chamber, two alongside their husbands.[MASK] In his treatment of this episode, Christopher Dyer focuses on the workings of the bishop of Worcester’s estate, and as such finds that the ‘nepotistic deal … caused ill-feeling among the tenants’, with no mention of women.[MASK] Yet the contentious issue for the tenants was not so much to do with the ugly machinations between officials as with the resulting loss of customs that was detrimental to them all. Women did not only act on ‘private’ concerns, but in cases touching the civic liberties of their locality, in the manner of burgesses resisting perceived incursions.The protests of women are consistently linked in our minds to fears around provision. There is of course some evidence to support the idea that women were driven by these concerns, in particular the oft-cited grain riots of the early sixteenth century.[CITATION-46]","B.

There is of course some evidence to support the idea that women were driven by these concerns, in particular the oft-cited grain riots of the early sixteenth century.[MASK] On 20 July 1532, a group of women seized a cart of wheat and brought it into Norwich market, selling the grain below the price set by the mayor. Afterwards, some of the women went to drink together. The mayor’s court subsequently labelled the episode as an ‘insurreccion … of women’.[MASK] Of the twelve women appearing by name in the deposition, at least five were wives. The ringleaders were sentenced to be whipped in the market, although some were remitted, perhaps having opted to pay a fine. In their depositions, the women did not cite provision fears, which might have garnered the sympathy of the court. Elizabeth Barret said that she joined ‘for pitie’ of a woman she saw being physically attacked for her measure of corn, while Agnes Haddon simply said that she followed the price that seemed to have been set by the other women present.[MASK] In assessing the role of women in popular politics, we must be mindful of the very limited access we have to the specific actions or impetus of any participant, regardless of gender. Women were not driven by one motive, did not perform a singular role. Defining their part is as challenging as defining that of male rebels. Few historians seek to point to universal factors that drove men to join large-scale insurrections—they generally look to provide a nuanced, multi-causal view—but in the case of the 1401 Bristol riots, Simon Walker argues that female participation was ‘intended to emphasize the damagingeffects of royal fiscal demands’.[MASK] Even more explicitly, Cohn does not consider it problematic to suggest that in seeking explanations for women’s reasons for participating in revolts, ‘biological determinacy should reappear’, despite having been widely discredited, as ‘basic needs of the hearth bore more heavily on women … scarcity stimulated women’s basic instincts to protect and preserve their offspring’.[CITATION-50]","Cohn, ‘Women in Revolt’, p. 216.",1
62,1.0,Houlbrooke,Women’s Social Life,1,"the example of the Evil May Day riots of 1517, during which apprentices and guild members attacked resident alien and immigrant workers, McSheffrey argues that the participants’ motives were economic and political, and ‘specifically concerned men rather than women’.[MASK] Yet by one chronicler’s account, and as McSheffrey recognises, eleven of the four hundred people pardoned by the king were women.[MASK] If we are willing to accept that these women may, too, have been politically, economically, or indeed xenophobically motivated, then we must look to structures rather than individual agency to account for the disparity in participation.Considering how actions were characterised in the record might help us to understand how participation was represented, and that might in turn throw some light on the reporting of women’s activism. In 1455, silkwomen of London petitioned Henry VI in parliament regarding the lack of adequate raw materials. Their complaint was explicitly framed as a means to prevent idleness among ‘young gentlewomen and other apprentices’, with the implicit message that these would otherwise fall into dissolute or disruptive behaviours. The petition was answered with remedial legislation.[MASK] This example serves as a reminder that public action did not necessarily have to involve violence or weaponry, and, furthermore, that the way we view uprisings depends almost entirely on the response of authorities. The picture is complicated when we consider how protest, revolt, insurrection and riot are defined, both by historians and in contemporary sources, as terminology in the latter was far from systematic.[MASK] The example of ‘riot’ is particularly instructive. In his 1984 study,, John Bellamy provides a succinct history of the term, from which it emerges that for much of the fifteenth century there was no clear official usage.[MASK] Indeed, although ‘riot’, ‘rout’ and ‘unlawful assembly’ were regarded by lawyers as separate offences, there were no practical differences in how they were treated in law.[MASK] Bellamy argues for a formative moment in the development of ‘riot’ as a specific offence sometime between 1488 and 1503, in which year legal doctrine on riot found perhaps its most influential statement in a reading delivered by Thomas Marowe as a preliminary to his becoming serjeant-at-law.[MASK] If we are to believe Bellamy, Marowe’s definition became the standard, and early Tudor treatises and commentaries were largely agreed: a riot was an assembly of more than two people with the purpose of breaking the law, with an act committed to that purpose. One clause of Marowe’s definition is of particular interest here:If several women or children below years of discretion assemble of themselves for their own cause, this is not a riot. But if any other person causes such persons to assemble to make such a riot, in this case it will be said to be a riot.[MASK] We might conclude that anyone in late medieval England seeking to make the case that an assembly of women was unlawful had to suggest male complicity or involvement as a matter of course—even if this did not necessarily reflect the realities of the case.[CITATION-62]","Houlbrooke, ‘Women’s Social Life’, p. 182.",1

Even more importantly, while law books after 1503 echo Marowe’s tone in terms of the number of participants necessary (more than two) and the requirement of intent and fulfilment of intent (gathering with the purpose of breaking the law, and committing the act), I have not found any example that repeats the specification of gender, and far beyond 1503 there is little evidence to suggest that women ceased to be imagined capable of rioting.[MASK] In February 1537, Sir Thomas Arundel came under fire from Cromwell for his failure to report a riot by women, and, as late as 1589, a group of twenty-seven women of the parish of Enfield were indicted for having ‘assembled themselves riotously’, without any indication of male involvement.[MASK] Thus, while Marowe may have sought to exclude women from popular protest on the basis of gender, there does not seem to have been any systematic application of his ideas, either in subsequent law books or in practices of prosecution.Perhaps more fruitful is John Baker’s suggestion that arms were the most important factor in turning a lawful assembly into a riot.[CITATION-65]","Baker, History of the Laws of England, p. 592 n. 90.",1
79,1.0,Houlbrooke,Women’s Social Life,1,"1536–7 demonstrates the impact of approaching records in this manner.[MASK] The public execution of Margaret Cheyney for her part in inciting treason is well known.[MASK] But women’s involvement in the revolts did not end with Cheyney. Following the dispersal of the rebels at the close of 1536, the duke of Norfolk was tasked with quelling the new swathe of uprisings in 1537. In Cumberland and Westmorland, the king’s law gave way to martial law.[MASK] In May, it came to Cromwell’s attention that a number of the rebels who were hanged and left displayed had been taken down and buried in the night. Norfolk made inquiries, and wrote to the king that seventy-four bodies were missing, and that the perpetrators were ‘all women, and not one man’.[MASK] Only the examinations for Cockermouth survive. They present that the principal instigators were the widows of rebels, acting with their mothers, mothers-in-law, daughters, friends, and indeed one mercenary.[MASK] Some admitted to cutting down the bodies, while others claimed they simply fell. Unco-operative clergy refused to bury the traitors in consecrated ground; the women either secretly buried them in churchyards anyway, or in one case, in a nearby ditch. The flurry of letters between Norfolk, Cromwell and the king on the matter shows that this was considered to be a serious act of defiance for which punishment was necessary—although evidence for precisely what this may have entailed does not survive.[MASK] But even as Norfolk reported this resistance to royal authority by women, Cromwell responded that the explanation was not satisfactory to the king, as such a scheme ‘cam not only of womens hedes’.[MASK] In fact, only two instances of male involvement were found, and these were supporters rather than instigators.[MASK] We as scholars must then correct for two levels of erasure—that of contemporary comment, and that of our own definitions of what it meant to protest.By attempting to hone definitions we have masked the plethora of meanings and interpretations that could be applied in any given case, and created an invisible category, ‘women’. We have ended up assuming a male group, partly because one authority says so and partly because it is what we—or, at times, our sources—expect to see. There is clearly a disparity in the lexicon we are using when we talk about women in popular protest: the remedy is to think more flexibly about female disorder, and its perceived role within legitimate complaint.[MASK] We now turn to the status of the ‘outcry’, and where this mode of public action may have stood within the spectrum of (il)legitimate action. In 1442, John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, brought home only five of the sixteen tenants of his manor in Painswick, Gloucestershire, whom he had taken to war in France. An outcry ensued.[MASK] The issue at stake, suggests Houlbrooke in his account of this episode, was that, for the eleven wives, this meant widowhood and the loss of their husbands’ holdings. The outcry led to the widows securing rights to their husbands’ lands for life.[CITATION-79]","Houlbrooke, ‘Women’s Social Life’, p. 176.",1

Mutibwa,Uganda Since Independence: A Story of Unfulfilled Hopes,1,"required ‘enlightenment’.[MASK] In preparing English-language statements to be published in the press, both UPC and DP election candidates presented their role as the ‘dissemination of knowledge’, a ‘fight against ignorance’: ‘We must educate our people so that they can begin to see further than the frontiers of their own districts’.[MASK] Many Ugandan politicians apparently shared the reported concern of Grace Ibingira, another UPC leader, that the ‘common man’ only understood the language of ‘tribe or religion’.[MASK] That vision of nationalist politics as tutelary was heavily inflected by the abrupt late colonial lurch towards teaching citizenship, and was by no means unique to Uganda. The ‘mass education’ imagined by late imperial policy was a political as well as an economic project: people must be taught to be governed.[MASK] Before the independence of what became Tanzania, Julius Nyerere declared that people ‘must learn to think as a nation’; the Zambian nationalist leader Kenneth Kaunda wrote of the urgent need for a ‘high level of national intelligence and education’.[MASK] In the 1960s, academic analysis echoed the anxieties of departing colonial officials and nationalist politicians: ‘political socialisation’ became the vogue term for the urgently felt need to teach people how to be citizens.[MASK] But Uganda was seen as particularly threatened by division, and its people especially in need of tutelary politics, partly because of the messy and inconsistent British policy around independence. As the imagined slow timetable for self-government turned swiftly to plans for a rapid withdrawal at the end of the 1950s, the British had feared that the intransigence of Buganda’s ruler, the, would tear Uganda apart even before they could leave. They sought simultaneously to placate Bugandan particularism and to grant swift independence to Uganda as a nation. Obote had become the leader of the nationalist UPC party when it was created in 1960 as a determined advocate of national unity. But in 1962, as independence negotiations stalled, he seized the moment to offer an electoral pact to theand his supporters, offering Buganda special status after independence.For some this seemed an unprincipled compromise with tribalism, but Obote, writing in the press for an English-speaking audience, defended his deal as a necessary expedient: ‘unity and understanding’ were the goals of the party, but the problem was that people had ‘loyalty’ to their traditions and there was a need to overcome their ‘fear’ of central government—the task of his party was to ‘effect unity on [] the country and amongst the people of Uganda’.[MASK] The deal carried the UPC to victory in the 1962 elections—making Obote prime minister at independence in that year, and allowing theto become titular president of Uganda shortly afterwards. Speaking to the party conference shortly afterwards (in a speech which was published in, a new English-language journal for culture and politics, published in Uganda), Obote insisted that, whatever the deal with Buganda, Uganda was ‘one country with one National Parliament and Government’.[MASK] The thoroughly predictable unravelling of Obote’s deal with thein the aftermath of independence has been well described elsewhere.[CITATION-38]","P.

This article examines the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and the five post-war treaties (Versailles, Saint-Germain, Neuilly, Trianon and Sèvres) to explore how these issues were resolved in the post-war settlements. Rather than focusing solely on the substance of the treaties, the article examines the process through which they were negotiated, paying particular attention to the crucial role played by lobbyists such as museum directors, writers and politicians. It sets these negotiations in the wider context of the contemporary discourse about cultural destruction.The article asserts that the cultural provisions of the post-war treaties sit at the intersection of two key issues in post-war peacemaking: self-determination and reparations. Many states presented claims for the return of cultural objects or compensation for cultural destruction as essential to their national restoration after the war. Cultural claims generally appeared in the treaties’ reparation clauses and their enactment was inherited by the post-war Inter-Allied Reparation Commission.The article argues that the post-war treaties demonstrate the dominance of the cultural claims of Western allies over those of eastern Europe and colonial settings. They also demonstrate a tension between a belief in universal civilisation and the claims of nation states to ownership of cultural property, which was most apparent in cases involving the dissolution of the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. Fundamentally, the decisions reached were often arbitrary rather than being guided by consistent principles or norms.In his 1923 account of Woodrow Wilson’s role in the post-First World War settlements, Ray Stannard Baker wrote of the huge quantity of ‘passionate and hopeful’ appeals that reached the American president from around the world prior to the Paris Peace Conference.[MASK] Baker, who had served as Wilson’s press secretary, described these appeals collectively as ‘the heart of the world laid bare’, with petitioners seeking approval for their claims for ‘islands and mines and harbours and secure boundaries and Rubens pictures and antique coins!’[MASK] Each of the five treaties signed at the end of the war—Versailles, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Trianon and Sèvres—included articles which dealt explicitly with cultural matters. These covered issues such as the restitution of items that nations claimed had been looted from them either during the war or in the conflicts that preceded it and reparation for acts of cultural destruction that took place during the war. Most of these provisions were the result of a messy interplay between claims made by national delegations, lobbying by external actors and deliberation by representatives of the victorious Allies. They were generally discussed and formalised under the wider rubric of reparations.[MASK] Much has been written about the diplomacy of the Paris Peace Conference and the five treaties that resulted from it.[MASK] Within this literature, the cultural articles included in the treaties have received some attention, primarily from legal historians who emphasise the importance of the peace treaties in the development of international law and international norms.

They were generally discussed and formalised under the wider rubric of reparations.[MASK] Much has been written about the diplomacy of the Paris Peace Conference and the five treaties that resulted from it.[MASK] Within this literature, the cultural articles included in the treaties have received some attention, primarily from legal historians who emphasise the importance of the peace treaties in the development of international law and international norms. Wayne Sandholtz has argued that the First World War led to an ‘important turn through the cycle of norm change’ with respect to cultural destruction and pillage.[MASK] Ana Filipa Vrdoljak has posited that the treaties ‘laid down foundational principles for contemporary international cultural heritage law’.[MASK] Andrzej Jakubowski’s work emphasises the role of the post-war settlements in establishing the idea of ‘state succession to tangible cultural heritage in cases of cession and dissolution of the multinational state’.[MASK] These valuable works take elements of the settlements and trace their wider importance to subsequent legal developments, such as the protection of cultural property.[CITATION-8]","R.

The 1970s Liberal revival nevertheless laid important political foundations which the SDP/Liberal Alliance would build on after 1981, as it sought to articulate a centrist alternative to Thatcherism.On Monday 2 September 1974, the Liberal Party leader, Jeremy Thorpe, stopped off in a rain-soaked Brighton as part of a pre-election tour of English coastal resorts. Three days earlier, Thorpe’s attempt to appeal to late-summer holidaymakers had descended into farce when his hovercraft ran aground on Sidmouth beach, but at Brighton he offered a sober warning about Britain’s mounting economic difficulties.[MASK] His flamboyant style, he explained to ainterviewer, was designed to draw attention to a ‘deadly serious’ message: ‘we are living beyond our means, the Government is borrowing more than it could ever hope to repay, our debts are accumulating to the tune of £4,500 million annually and there is no single panacea which can rescue us’.[MASK] If the coming October election produced another hung Parliament, the Liberals would seek to form a Government of National Unity in order to ‘save the country from the perils of bankruptcy, poverty and unemployment’. Unless the UK’s democratic leaders took ‘a grip on its affairs’, Thorpe warned, then ‘less discerning individuals’ would ‘have no scruples about using more painful instruments of repression’ to tackle the nation’s problems.[MASK] The 1970s is widely remembered as a turning point in post-war British history: a period when inflation and trade union militancy led to a crisis of confidence in the post-war settlement and helped open the door for Margaret Thatcher’s election victory in 1979. Political narratives of the decade have tended to be structured around a series of failures of governance—the 1973–4 energy crisis, the 1976 International Monetary Fund (IMF) application, and the 1978–9 ‘Winter of Discontent’—from which the Thatcher government’s monetarist experiment offered a divisive but politically successful way out.[MASK] As historians such as Lawrence Black and Hugh Pemberton have pointed out, however, the prevailing view of the 1970s as a ‘benighted decade’ is itself a politically constructed one, which risks obscuring more complex patterns of social and cultural change and foreclosing the possibility of different outcomes.[MASK] On the one hand, electoral dealignment and fears of ‘the break-up of Britain’ can be seen as symptoms of a larger cultural shift in which class-based identities and established social institutions were disrupted by the decline of ‘deference’ and the rise of ‘popular individualism’.[MASK] On the other hand, we also need to pay close attention to the complex temporalities of the decade and the political contingencies involved in the coming of Thatcherism.Recent accounts of the construction of ‘crisis’ in 1970s Britain have largely focused on Conservative politicians and their supporters in the press—as, for instance, in Camilla Schofield’s study of Enoch Powell, Robert Saunders’s work on Margaret Thatcher, and Colin Hay’s influential analysis of the ‘Winter of Discontent’.[MASK] As Jim Tomlinson has noted, however, ‘declinism’ was by no means confined to the political right, but ‘became the common currency of British politics in the 1970s’.[CITATION-8]","J.

In the general election of February 1974, the Liberals won more than six million votes (19.3 per cent of the total) and helped remove Edward Heath’s government from office; in October 1974 they ran 619 candidates, took 18.3 per cent of the vote, and confirmed their renewed political relevance. Though the party struggled to convert these votes into parliamentary seats, returning fourteen MPs in February and thirteen in October, the tight results produced by the two elections gave the small band of Liberals significant weight in the House of Commons.[MASK] Between March 1977 and July 1978, Thorpe’s successor David Steel and his colleagues sustained Jim Callaghan’s government in power through the ‘Lib–Lab Pact’—the first such formal inter-party agreement since the Second World War.[MASK] Even as Liberal support declined during the late 1970s, the party remained a significant factor in Labour and Conservative calculations. Indeed, Margaret Thatcher’s success in winning over between one-quarter and two-fifths of October 1974 Liberal voters was one of the foundations of her 1979 election victory.[MASK] To date, however, the Thorpe-era Liberal revival has received surprisingly little attention from historians. The only full-length study of the party in the 1970s—a 1999 Ph.D. thesis by Ruth Fox—remains unpublished, and other analysis is largely confined to biographies (such as Michael Bloch’s life of Thorpe), general surveys of the party’s history and political thought (such as Tudor Jones’s study of(2011)), and specialist articles in the.[CITATION-13]","Jonathan Kirkup has also produced a valuable recent study of the Lib–Lab Pact: Kirkup, Lib–Lab Pact.

The Liberals’ strong performance in the two elections of 1974 reminds us that feelings of ‘powerlessness’ and alienation from governing elites were politically mutable, and could be given shape by liberal as well as conservative forms of populism.The article develops this argument in six main steps. The first section sets the scene by placing the Liberal Party in the wider social and political context of early 1970s Britain, including the cultural tensions brought to the fore by Enoch Powell’s ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech, and examines how younger activists sought to revive Liberal fortunes after the disastrous 1970 election through campaign-oriented ‘community politics’. A second section unpacks the Liberal response to the economic challenges which Britain faced during the Heath years, and argues that the party’s 1974 campaigns were rooted in a coherent (if somewhat technocratic) vision of a reconstructed post-war settlement. The third and fourth sections trace the revival of the party’s electoral fortunes from the by-election victories of 1972–3 to the general elections of February and October 1974. The fifth section explores how core elements of the Liberal agenda—particularly interest in electoral reform and ‘national unity’—continued to shape political debate into the later 1970s, but were ultimately squeezed out by the more assertive ‘conviction politics’ of Mrs Thatcher. Finally, the conclusion reflects on the wider implications of the Liberal revival for our understanding of post-war British politics.The Liberal Party began the 1970s in a parlous state. In the election of June 1970—Thorpe’s first as leader—the party lost six of the twelve seats which it had won four years earlier, and Thorpe himself only clung on in North Devon by 369 votes. If the landslide Labour victory in 1966 had dashed Jo Grimond’s hopes of a ‘realignment of the left’, the unpopularity of Harold Wilson’s government in the final years of the decade left the Liberals adrift, caught out by a rising tide of conservatism. Thorpe spent much of the 1970 campaign accusing Edward Heath of moving ‘further and further to the right’ under pressure from Enoch Powell, whom he described as ‘stark staring bonkers’, but the Tory victory suggested that many voters were unperturbed.[MASK] Eric Lubbock’s defeat at Orpington, which he had won in a famous by-election in 1962, set the seal on the Liberal reverse. ‘[A]fter a decade of struggle to break back into the mainstream of British political life’, Peter Fiddick noted in, the Liberals had been reduced to ‘a tiny rump’ and were ‘once more the party of the Celtic fringe’.[MASK] agreed, and predicted that if the Heath government performed even ‘reasonably well’ there was ‘no likelihood of the Liberals being able to make any impact’ in the coming Parliament.[MASK] The Liberals’ poor performance in 1970 partly stemmed from the weakness of Thorpe’s campaign—Peter Hain, then a leading Young Liberal activist, thought the manifesto was ‘shoddy, incoherent, and totally negative’—but it also reflected the party’s traditional vulnerability to a Conservative recovery in rural and suburban areas.[CITATION-22]","London, British Library [hereafter BL], Add.

71,1.0,H. Rose,The Liberal Party and Institutional Reform,1,"‘an age of stability’ with ‘controlled economic growth’, it was all the more important to limit ‘private consumption by the few in favour of better public services for the majority of our citizens’.[MASK] Secondly, the Liberals promised to transform the relationship between workers and employers by making radical changes to corporate structure. Under the label of ‘co-partnership’, the party proposed to create Works Councils in firms with more than twenty employees, to require firms with more than fifty employees to introduce profit-sharing schemes, and to give employees half the votes (alongside shareholders) in the election of ‘supervisory boards’. These proposals drew on a longer history of Liberal thinking about partnership which dated back at least as far as David Lloyd George’s ‘Yellow Book’ on(1928) and had been fleshed out in the 1960s by Peter McGregor, a manager at the engineering firm Ferranti. During 1973, Liberal MPs introduced private members’ bills on the subject in an attempt to capture public attention, and Thorpe claimed that co-partnership would create ‘a totally new climate in industry’, which would help to solve the UK’s economic problems.[MASK] As Stuart White has pointed out, the Liberals’ plans implied a sharp break with the traditional conception of the capitalist firm, placing significant constraints on managerial autonomy and the pursuit of shareholder value. At the same time, they also attempted to empower workers as individuals, in contrast to the Labour left’s trade union-orientated vision of industrial democracy.[MASK] Thirdly, the Liberals reframed their long-standing commitment to constitutional reform as a response to the new political moment. Proportional representation (PR) remained the party’s main demand, but Thorpe and his colleagues now justified it not only on grounds of fairness but also as a way of restoring the effectiveness and legitimacy of the UK political system. Electoral reform would end the abrupt swings of the pendulum which had destabilised British economic policy since 1964 and encourage a more consensual and ‘European’ style of government. In line with the principles of community politics, the Liberals also called for a radical devolution of power from Westminster and Whitehall: first to elected parliaments or assemblies in Scotland, Wales, and the English regions, then to local authorities, and finally to neighbourhood councils, which—unlike the districts created by the 1972 Local Government Act—would be small enough to allow for meaningful participation.[MASK] The defence of local particularity against the centralising tendencies of the British state had been a hallmark of Liberal politics since the Second World War, but the 1970s reaction against ‘bureaucracy’ and ‘bigness’ gave it broader resonance. Lord Crowther-Hunt and Alan Peacock echoed the Liberal diagnosis in their memorandum of dissent to the 1973 Kilbrandon Report on the Constitution, arguing that sweeping decentralisation was necessary to deal with a ‘pervading sense of powerlessness’ and ‘indications of a growing alienation from the governmental system’.[MASK] As the Liberal activist Hannan Rose noted in, the party found, ‘perhaps to its own surprise’, that ‘some of its old, well-worn and well-loved tunes’ had finally begun to attract public attention.[CITATION-71]","H.

The Liberal agenda reflected the institutionalist tendencies of British social thought in the 1960s and 1970s, which (in different ways) had shaped both Wilson and Heath’s attempts at ‘modernisation’.[MASK] There were also links with the ‘reconstructionist’ ideas of progressive business leaders such as George Goyder and Wilfred Brown—who sought to defuse industrial conflict by restructuring the capitalist firm and placing it within a new social architecture—and with the emerging environmentalist movement.[MASK] Yet the political meaning of this agenda was fundamentally ambiguous. On one level, the 1974 Liberal manifestos came as close as the party had probably ever done to challenging the assumptions of market economics in the name of social justice, building on the communitarianism of the Edwardian New Liberals and the interventionism of ‘centrist-liberal’ economists such as Keynes and Beveridge.[MASK] At the same time, the party’s interest in redistribution, co-partnership and political reform could also be seen as a way of bolstering the legitimacy of the state and strengthening its ability to face down the unions. If many Liberal activists saw their party through the former lens, some of its sympathisers in the press—such as Rees-Mogg and Bernard Levin in—appear to have been more interested in the latter.[MASK] The upturn in the Liberals’ electoral support was sudden and unexpected. As late as February 1972,saw ‘no sign of another revival’: the party’s poll ratings had languished in the single digits since the 1970 election, and it had fought only five out of twelve by-elections, losing its deposit in four of them.[MASK] Thorpe’s own performance had been lacklustre since his first wife Caroline died in a tragic post-election car crash, and it was only when the European Communities Bill came to the Commons in early 1972 that he really returned to form.[MASK] Then, as Heath imposed a wage freeze and Labour’s divisions widened, the Liberal by-election bandwagon started rolling. In October 1972, Cyril Smith gained Rochdale from Labour on the basis of a populist local campaign; in December, Graham Tope won the safe Conservative seat of Sutton and Cheam on a 33 per cent swing; and during 1973 the Liberals took the Isle of Ely, Ripon, and Berwick-upon-Tweed from the Tories. This gave them five by-election gains in just over a year, along with three very respectable second places.As Richard Jay has pointed out, the Liberals were ‘lucky in both the timing and the location of the by-elections’, which allowed them to harness the votes of disillusioned Conservatives just as they had done at Orpington in the early 1960s.[CITATION-78]","Jay, ‘Lincoln and the Liberal Surge’, p. 213.",1

Across the two elections of 1974, Conservative Central Office spent over £1.6 million and Transport House just under £1 million, while even the inclusion of Thorpe’s direct aid accounts only took central Liberal spending to about £300,000.[MASK] At constituency level, the gap was smaller: Liberal candidates’ election expenses averaged £725 in October, compared with £1,275 for Conservatives and £1,163 for Labour candidates.[MASK] Alongside the national campaign, the Liberals concentrated their efforts on about forty ‘critical marginals’, drawing on the work of the Winnable Seats Committee, which Thorpe had established in the 1960s, and the experience which agents such as John Spiller had gained in the 1972–3 by-elections.[MASK] Almost all of these seats were Conservative-held, so squeezing residual Labour support became a particular focus.[MASK] As both Labour and the Conservatives sought to burnish their moderate credentials, however, Liberal poll ratings struggled to break through the 20 per cent mark. In the final week of the campaign, Thorpe focused his argument back on political reform in an attempt to ‘sharpen and simplify’ the party’s message:Shall we persevere with the mistakes of a quarter of a century for another five years on October 10, or shall we have the courage to BREAK THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM—AND SAVE BRITAIN[?][MASK] Peter Riddell of thethought Thorpe was ‘more surefooted’ after this pivot, but there was no Liberal surge, and attempts to attract tactical anti-Tory votes bore little fruit.[MASK] Overall, the Liberal vote share fell back slightly, and the party dropped to thirteen seats, losing Hazel Grove and Bodmin while gaining Truro.

David Steel argued that the Liberal message had been ‘too intellectual and too complicated’ and that the party needed to strengthen its appeal to ‘erstwhile Labour voters’, but some activists felt that Thorpe and Steel’s musings about coalition had alienated precisely this group.[MASK] Some members of the national executive thought the emphasis on ‘the gravity of the country’s economic situation’ had been overdone, to the detriment of ‘other matters of equally vital concern to the people’.

As Robert Saunders has pointed out, ‘the spirit of cross-party solidarity embodied by Britain in Europe was widely applauded’ in the press, and the referendum result was seen as a decisive victory for ‘moderates’ over the Labour left and the Powellite right.[CITATION-131]","R.

151,1.0,Saunders,"“Crisis, what Crisis?”",1,"voted Liberal in the two 1974 elections and publicly urged politicians to break free from ‘adversary politics’.[MASK] At the same time, PR also appealed to businessmen who feared the rise of a left-wing Labour government and complained that policy instability was undermining their investment plans. For instance, a meeting of British United Industrialists in June 1975 found ‘considerable agreement that the present electoral system … is very bad for private enterprise which needs to make long-term plans and cannot know whether such plans might be viable under whatever Government may be in power’.[MASK] Thorpe canvassed business support for PR during 1974 and 1975, and drew a sympathetic response from figures such as Sir Val Duncan of Rio Tinto Zinc and Sir Marcus Sieff of Marks & Spencer.[MASK] This interest in constitutional reform overlapped somewhat uneasily with right-wing machinations against the Labour government. Indeed, Duncan reportedly convened a dinner for business leaders in May 1975 at which he talked about how the army would ‘play its proper role’ if the UK descended into anarchy.[MASK] Thorpe hoped that corporate donors would either defect to the Liberals or use their influence to swing the Conservatives round to electoral reform, but in the end, neither happened. Though Heathite MPs such as Douglas Hurd and Sir George Young were sympathetic, Margaret Thatcher was deeply hostile to both PR and the broader coalitionist impulse.[MASK] As her biographer Charles Moore has noted, ‘“National unity” annoyed Mrs. Thatcher very much’, because she ‘instinctively preferred the public two-party battle to a world of private understandings and shifting alliances’ and ‘believed that the answer to the national crisis was not the forging of a national consensus round the old, wrong policies, but a bold leap for new, right ones’.[MASK] The Conservatives’ rejection of consensus politics reflected Thatcher’s commitment to monetarism and the wider free-market agenda, which (as Jim Bulpitt pointed out in his classic analysis of Tory ‘statecraft’) offered an alternative means of reasserting the authority of the state.[MASK] At the same time, this strategic decision was also shaped by a particular view of the ‘Liberal vote’. The October 1974 Tory campaign had been premised on the belief that voters who had abandoned Heath for Thorpe favoured ‘moderation’, but Thatcher and her allies were more impressed by the heterogeneity of Liberal support. Nigel Lawson, for instance, insisted that the assumption that ‘the Liberal vote is a liberal vote’ was a ‘complete misconception’. Rather, Thorpe had attracted an anti-establishment ‘protest vote’ which had already largely disintegrated by the late 1970s.[MASK] The belief that ‘a special ploy to get the … Liberal vote’ was unnecessary meant that the Conservatives tackled the Liberals ‘in a very low key’ during the 1979 campaign.[MASK] Even so, Thatcher did develop a distinctive approach to dealing with the party. As Saunders has pointed out, the sharp rhetorical contrast which Thatcher drew between Conservative ‘freedom’ and Labour’s ‘socialism’ had the effect of ‘squeezing the space for the Liberals’ and reinforcing the bipolar tendencies of the existing electoral system.[CITATION-151]","Saunders, ‘“Crisis, what Crisis?”’, p. 33.",1

Between October 1974 and 1979, the Conservative vote rose by 3.2 million. BES data suggest that this involved a net gain of about a million votes from the Liberals and about 750,000 votes from Labour, with the rest coming from differential turnout and the minor parties.[MASK] The BES found that most of the Thorpe-to-Thatcher switchers were former Conservative voters who were returning to the fold, but some were new converts.[MASK] Thatcher not only won back middle-class voters (and especially women) who had flirted with the Liberals earlier in the decade, but also made inroads into traditional Liberal heartlands.[MASK] In particular, the Conservatives defeated Thorpe in North Devon and Pardoe in North Cornwall, and won the rural Welsh seat of Montgomery for the first time since 1874. The fact that Thorpe was about to stand trial on charges of conspiracy to murder a former gay lover hardly helped the Liberal cause.[MASK] By contrast, Thatcher’s brand of Conservatism, rooted in her provincial Methodist background, resonated with many small-business people and Nonconformist voters. As in 1970, the Liberals found it difficult to insulate themselves from a middle-class backlash against Labour’s economic record or to deflect the Tories’ appeal to cultural conservatism.Set in this broader context, it is clear that the Liberal revival is of profound importance for our understanding of political change in 1970s Britain. The events of 1972–4 established the Liberals as a major political force across rural and suburban England for the first time since the Second World War, building on the foundations which had been laid in the Orpington period. Thorpe and his colleagues articulated a resonant critique of class politics and warned that Conservative and Labour governments were leading the nation into crisis; as such, they were agents as well as beneficiaries of dealignment. At a cultural level, the Liberals gave expression both to young voters’ frustration with the starchiness and materialism of post-war politics and to a more conservative (and in many ways antithetical) impulse towards ‘national unity’. The very ambiguity of Liberal policy contributed to this broad appeal. In particular, the demand for electoral reform and the belief in ‘community politics’ allowed the Liberals to adopt the rhetoric of ‘anti-system’ populism while remaining firmly committed to pluralist parliamentary democracy.[MASK] By framing ‘adversary politics’ as a hangover from the industrial conflicts of the early twentieth century, the Liberals also tapped in to a growing sense that class-based identities were becoming anachronistic. Voting Liberal was a simple way for people to assert their political agency, even (or perhaps especially) if it was a one-off act rather than a lasting conversion.The political scientist Peter Hall has characterised the mid- and late 1970s as a period of deep political choice in Britain, in which the crisis of confidence in Keynesian economic management opened up the ‘marketplace for economic ideas’ and paved the way for a ‘paradigm shift’ towards monetarism and neo-liberalism.[CITATION-165]","P.A.

Shapin,You Are What You Eat: Historical Changes in Ideas About Food and Identity,1,"this article locates the health of the passions in a broader framework of early modern preventative healthcare and analyses how early modern people attempted to control their passions through everyday comfort eating. Tessa Storey and Sandra Cavallo have demonstrated the importance of prevention for governing the passions and ensuring a healthy body. This could be achieved in a variety of ways: for example, theologians and physicians encouraged people to detach themselves through prayer and spiritual exercises from the worldly cares that could trigger the production of unwanted passions.[MASK] Storey and Cavallo’s intervention, although welcome, has served to separate the passions from other aspects of life that could impact emotional health. This is partly a result of Storey and Cavallo structuring their book around the six non-natural things—the six spheres of life—including air, food and drink, rest and exercise, sleep and waking, excretions and retentions, and the passions of the mind, that could impact the proper functioning of the body, but is also the result of a wider trend to examine these six non-naturals separately.[MASK] Illnesses caused by disturbed passions could be managed through the careful regulation of all the six non-natural things. The ‘passions’ were both one of the six non-naturalsan internal bodily reaction. Unsurprisingly, the sixth non-natural known as the ‘passions of the mind’ was most closely connected to the production of bodily passions and the diseases associated with them. The ‘passions of the mind’, can, in their simplest form, be defined as the external social triggers and experiences that could lead to the creation of unwanted passions within the body and it is on this aspect of emotional health that scholars such as Storey and Cavallo have focused their attention.[MASK] By examining practices of comfort eating, this article reveals the extent to which the health of the passions was also reliant on wider lifestyle decisions, including what a person ate on a daily basis.Of all the six non-naturals, diet has been the subject of the most detailed historical analysis. Numerous works have demonstrated the role played by food and drink in early modern conceptions of health and disease, but surprisingly little has been said about the role of diet in the regulation of the passions and the illnesses that they were believed to generate.[MASK] This article argues that dietary management (by which I mean the intake of food and drink, rather than the more expansive early modern meaning that referred to the regulation of all the non-naturals) was critical to the health of the passions. Not only could food intake drastically alter the humoral balance of the body, and by extension the passions that an individual experienced, but foods that were considered comforting could spark the production of beneficial passions within the body, while suppressing those that were considered harmful.

Moreover, Josselin considered a ‘slender and a hard diett’ to be particularly conducive to his own health and he resolved to be ‘more moderate’ in his diet in the future.[MASK] Josselin does not give us an indication of whether he managed to incorporate Lessius’s advice successfully into his own diet, but his diary, along with other letters and journals from the seventeenth century, suggests that restricting food intake was not the only way to spark cheerfulness through dietary choices. Cornaro noted that the general belief was that ‘that which savours, is good and nourisheth’.[MASK] In other words, to stay healthy in body and mind, a person should eat foods that they enjoyed as they were likely to provide more nourishment. Lessius himself confessed that his ideas were not shared by all. As he begrudgingly admitted, it was generally accepted that it was ‘a great part of unhappinesse to be limited in a mans diet’.[MASK] Not only did many people consider a full and tasty diet to be good for health, they also believed that restricting your diet and not eating the foods you enjoyed could actually lead to the production of negative passions such as unhappiness. The senses, including that of taste, were indelibly linked to the creation of the passions. Wright noted that the senses were ‘joint friends’ with the passions and ‘whatsoever delighted sense, pleased the passions’.[MASK] An object, such as a particular food, would transfer its qualities to the senses (in this case, the taste buds) which would then transport this data via the spirits to the brain. This sensory information was then calibrated by the imagination, which would create an impression of the external object, in this case a specific food, to which the sensitive soul would respond with the creation of passions.[MASK] If, for example, a particular food tasted pleasurable, this sensory experience would stimulate positive passions, while if a food elicited disgust from the taste buds, a negative impression and negative passions would be created. How a food tasted thus helped individuals assess the potential impact it might have on the passions.While some, such as Josselin, could see the benefits of a spare diet, others sought comfort and pleasure through food, eating and recommending that others eat foods that brought them joy and cheerfulness.[MASK] In particular, the gifting of food and acts of commensality were considered excellent ways of promoting the health of the passions. Eating together and exchanging gifts of food not only established and strengthened social bonds and promoted ideals of Christian community and altruism, but were also practices that had significant medical implications.[MASK] In letters and diaries from the seventeenth century, gifts of particular foods with specific health properties were received and understood through the language of the passions. Common gifts included sugar, capons (castrated cockerels) and other delicate meats, and wine.[CITATION-94]","Felicity Heal has noted the prevalence of capons and sugar loaves as gifts but does not consider the medical implications of such gifts: Heal, Power of Gifts, pp. 35–43.",1

In November 1918, the academy led a joint action by British learned societies, who collectively approved a resolution stating that the peace conference should end the ‘systematic neglect and destruction of antiquities, and the obstruction of scientific exploration and excavation’ which had prevailed under Ottoman rule.[MASK] Under the lead of the British Academy, a committee of experts called the Archaeological Joint Committee (AJC) was formed to develop a policy and lobby the Foreign Office. The academy’s president, Sir Frederic Kenyon, believed that Britain had ‘a national responsibility for the records and relics of ancient civilization in those countries’.[MASK] In a memorandum sent to the Foreign Office in January 1919, Kenyon argued for the necessity of international access to antiquities because collections in ‘England, France, or Italy, for example, can be easily visited by scholars of all countries, and there are large publics in each of these countries who can understand and profit by the exhibition of them’, unlike in the territories of the former Ottoman Empire.[MASK] Kenyon reiterated these thoughts in a private letter to Lord Curzon, leader of the House of Lords and future Foreign Secretary, a few weeks later, arguing that objects such as cuneiform tablets were ‘useless unless they can be brought to countries where they can be studied’.[MASK] Both Curzon and Balfour were fellows of the Academy, which undoubtedly helped its case.Similar ideas emerged in the United States. In December 1918, James H. Breasted, a key figure in the development of American Egyptology, presented a proposal to the American Historical Association to ‘safeguard the future of scientific research, exploration and excavation’ in the former Ottoman Empire. Breasted argued that the ‘Near East … bequeathed our own civilization to Europe’ but warned that the ‘processes of normal life’ under the successors to the Ottoman Empire would result in the ‘wide destruction of ancient monuments’.[MASK] Breasted had a racial worldview which informed his attitudes to both the war and archaeology.[MASK] The archaeologist Howard Crosby Butler wrote a report on the matter as part of his work with the American government’s expert group, The Inquiry. Butler argued that, were independence granted to ‘the peoples of Anatolia, Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and Arabia … they would probably interfere with, or hamper, scientific investigation on the part of the foreigners’.[MASK] Both American and British plans reflected a deep-rooted belief that the populations of the former Ottoman Empire could not care for the antiquities in their territories. At the same time, the British Academy also maintained regular correspondence with the Institut de France regarding the organisation of post-war archaeology.[MASK] The British Academy’s plans were furthered by careful cultivation of influential figures in advance of the conference. Kenyon worked with the American archaeologist W.H. Buckler, and they liaised with the Near East experts in both the British and American delegations, ultimately facilitating co-operation between the two delegations in Paris.[MASK] Establishing these connections allowed Kenyon to send a draft of AJC resolutions to Sir Louis Mallet in Paris.[CITATION-119]","BAA, SEC/1/54, Kenyon to Mallet, 20 Feb. 1919.",1
107,1.0,L. Duguit,"L’État, le droit objectif et la loi positive",0,"the ‘pragmatic pluralism’ of the Third Republic in 1914–18. Born out of necessity, such pragmatism was also born out of opportunity. In this regard, too, the structure of military participation had a significant political impact. While the number of enlisted men as a percentage of the male population of military age hovered around 80 per cent in France (as opposed to 53 per cent in Britain), the number of potential political activists among the younger cohorts was significantly curtailed in the former.[MASK] In Béziers, where the figure was 84 per cent, military recruitment exceeded the national average. It further reinforced the social determinants of a political system that already put a premium on the accumulation of social capital and financial resources. This point stresses the importance for historians of political life of paying closer attention to the sociological determinants of collective action. The first wartime initiative of the Béziers branch of the Socialist Party was, as previously mentioned, to produce and publicise a letter stating its commitment to national defence. This was also its last official contribution to the local war effort. Military mobilisation soon deprived the branch of its leadership and of most of its male membership, and eventually forced it into abeyance.The Great War did not usher in any major upheaval, any redefinition of the organising and managing principles of the Republican state. Civil society was literally embodied by groups and individuals who were perfectly integrated into the Third Republic political system. There is no need for a detailed prosopography of urban elites to note the pre-eminence of teachers, lawyers and other professionals among the leadership of war-related charities. The Committee for the Relief of Wounded Soldiers of Béziers does nonetheless offer a salient example of the dynamic at work here. Formed on the initiative of the Deputy Prefect to meet a need that the state could not, this private association was led by individuals who had been selected by the town’s military authorities. They included prominent wine-growers (Cadenat, Viennet) and medical professionals (Dr Roger), while a local barrister, Ricateau, was the chairman. The over-representation of traditional republican elites was simply reinforced by the structures of military recruitment. The Parrains de l’arrondissement de Béziers, the organisation dedicated to local prisoners of war previously mentioned, originated in working-class and socialist milieus, which accounted for the social diversity of its leadership. By 1917, its takeover by middle-class professionals reflected in no small part the impact of conscription. Socialist organisations simply no longer had enough members to keep it running.The unitary republican state could therefore give pluralism its chance since military mobilisation had,, transformed urban political sociology and all but eliminated oppositional groups and activists. The social and political proximity between these urban elites and the upper echelons of the state administration accounts for the latitude granted to voluntary organisations by the prefectoral administration. The war challenged institutional and normative definitions of the Republican state and vindicated the pragmatic approach to public service embraced by the contemporary legal theorist Léon Duguit.[CITATION-107]","Léon Duguit offered a first iteration of his doctrine in 1901: L.

Recognising that this was a contentious issue, Villain and Hazon exercised their right to appoint a third arbiter to help them to judge the case. They chose Pierre Chabert, the consul to the French nation in Amsterdam, who had been forced to return to Paris after the outbreak of war. The three arbiters convened the parties at Chabert’s house on the afternoon of Thursday 6 October 1689 to hear the arguments and deliver their judgment.The record of this extraordinary dispute is kept in the Royal Insurance Company’s arbitration register. This register does not spell out the arguments presented by each party; instead, it lists the documents that were submitted to the arbiters for consideration: in keeping a record of these, the arbiters made sure that nothing was lost, ensuring that paperwork could be returned to the parties for later legal actions. Fortunately, we can sketch out the outlines of some of the arguments that were made by piecing this evidence together.

Article 38 declared ‘null’ all insurance ‘made after the loss or arrival of the insured effects, if the insured knew or could have known of the loss, or the insurer of the arrival, before the signing of the policy’.[MASK] The potential to hold this knowledge was determined through the presumptions of articles 39 and 40: ‘the insured will be presumed to have known of the loss, and the insurer the arrival of the insured effects, if it is found that, from the place of loss or the approach of the vessel, the news had been able to be carried [i.e. transmitted] before the signing of the policy to the place where it was concluded, in counting one and a half [nautical] leagues per hour, without prejudice to other proofs’.[CITATION-66]","Ibid., p. 94.

The couple’s progress northwards was hampered by the disapproval of ‘the people’. In this letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, the ambassador Eustace Chapuys remarked particularly upon the vocal role of women in stopping the royal party in its tracks. Modern scholars, in so far as they have noticed this episode, have interpreted it as demonstrating womanly interest in the ‘matrimonial affairs of the royal family’.[MASK] No one has thought to include the 1532 halting of the royal hunt in histories of political protest in Tudor England. The omission epitomises the systemic oversight of female dissent in late medieval and early Tudor England. Accounting for this omission, and starting to re-imagine what a properly constituted history of protest would look like, are the primary goals of this essay.[MASK] Popular politics in the fifteenth century, particularly the latter half, is in general an understudied area.[MASK] Yet one of the distinctive features of the later fourteenth to mid-sixteenth centuries is the recurrence of mass popular insurrections expressing collective grievance. On two occasions, 1450 and 1497, rebels (or petitioners) marched on London.[MASK] Women were demonstrably among them. Even so, most scholarly accounts up to the 1980s, and often beyond, portray revolt as a wholly male enterprise. If and when the subject of female participation is broached, it is concluded that women were little involved in public acts of dissent in England.[MASK] For example, Samuel Cohn found that ‘women, far from being the principal participants in later medieval protest, were remarkable for their absence’.[MASK] Where historians do find women at the centre of civil unrest, they explain their presence away.[MASK] The protestors, so the thinking goes, must have been interested in ‘women’s issues’: they were angry on behalf of deserted wives, such as Catherine. Their quarrel with the royal household pertained to the ‘private sphere’, without wider political significance.[MASK] By contrast, when late medieval or early modern men were involved, modern commentators decide that they spoke for a ‘common good’, and devote considerable interpretative energies to deciphering what spurred them into action, seeing—for instance—a wealth of meaning in protests about poverty, inequality or evil counsel.[MASK] The operative logic is that women can speak only for themselves, men for others. There is truly a monstrous regiment of assumptions about gender here.In her study of the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, Sylvia Federico issues a call to consider the ‘horizons of plausibility’ for women in revolt.[MASK] Pardon rolls, if not necessarily reflective of actual acts, do demonstrate the offences it was credible to suggest women could commit, and the accusations from which they felt the need to protect themselves.[CITATION-12]","R.A.

The looting of cultural property in war reached its high point during the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars but became increasingly controversial thereafter; the restitution of cultural objects by France after the Napoleonic wars has frequently been cited as a key turning point in the changing of attitudes towards plunder in wartime.[MASK] By the start of the twentieth century, the emergence of international law had begun to provide greater (theoretical) legal protection for cultural sites in wartime, but that did not always change behaviour.[MASK] Article 27 of the 1907 Hague Convention stated that in sieges and bombardments, ‘all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, [and] historic monuments … provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes’.[MASK] Crucially, colonised territories and populations—themselves frequently targets of cultural destruction—were afforded none of the protections that were emerging in the form of international law.[MASK] International protection of cultural sites was dramatically violated during the First World War. Alan Kramer has argued that cultural destruction was intrinsic to the violence of that conflict.[MASK] Across the European fronts, from the west to the east, historic, educational and religious sites were targeted in combat. The most infamous instances of cultural violence took place at the beginning of the war in Belgium and France. The destruction of Louvain library in August 1914 and the shelling of Reims Cathedral by the German army in late September became points of reference for German ‘barbarism’.[MASK] The violence on the Western Front in 1914 provoked an international outcry and initiated a discourse that viewed cultural destruction against the standard of international law as embodied in the Hague Convention.[MASK] These events were unique in their function as mobilising myths at the beginning of the conflict, but cultural destruction itself was not confined to Western Europe.The Austrian bombardment of Belgrade at the start of the conflict caused significant damage to the University of Belgrade and the Serbian national museum.[MASK] During its occupation of Serbia, which began in 1915, the Bulgarian army pursued a policy of ‘denationalisation’ in eastern Serbia, which sought to eradicate Serbian cultural influence through the destruction of books, manuscripts and archives.[MASK] This cultural violence mirrored that which had been seen during the Balkan Wars of 1912–13.[MASK] In the east, the occupying German army claimed that the retreating Russian forces were responsible for the destruction and looting of cultural objects such as statues, church bells and archives.[MASK] On the Italian front, the Austrian and German forces conducted bombing raids between 1915 and 1918 which caused significant damage to churches, museums, libraries and archives in towns and cities in northern Italy.[MASK] Following the bombing of Venice in 1918, one French newspaper remarked that ‘nothing is sacred to the Germans’, likening this bombardment to that of Reims Cathedral in 1914.[CITATION-29]","Le Miroir, 12 May 1918.",1

Belgium had been singled out in Wilson’s Fourteen Points as deserving full ‘restoration’ and, at the peace conference, the Belgian delegation pressured the peacemakers to ensure that they received special treatment.[MASK] The Serbian leader Nikola Pašić highlighted this inequality of treatment in a letter to Clemenceau.[MASK] Belgian treatment also suggests that cultural sites in Western Europe held an elevated status when compared with those in places such as Serbia, where details of widespread cultural damage were submitted to the conference’s commissions but not integrated into reparation settlements.France also called for the restitution of cultural objects in the Treaty of Versailles. Article 245 required that Germany restore ‘trophies, archives, historical souvenirs or works of art carried away from France’ during the course of the Franco-Prussian war of 1870–71. This provision emanated from a proposal which was tabled in the French Chamber of Deputies on the day of the armistice, 11 November 1918.[MASK] The trophies concerned were mostly flags, with the most cherished being those of General Bazaine, commander of the French Army of the Rhine, which had surrendered at Metz in October 1870.[MASK] A few days before Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, fourteen of these flags were stolen from the arsenal in Berlin and destroyed by German officers and soldiers in front of a statue of Frederick the Great, which raised tensions in France.[MASK] Speaking at the Chamber of Deputies, Clemenceau argued that the burning of these flags and the scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow meant that French people would need to remain ‘on their guard’ with respect to Germany.[MASK] Article 245 also required Germany to restore to France the Cerçay papers which were seized by Bismarck’s forces during the Franco-Prussian war in 1870. The papers contained diplomatic correspondence between Napoleon III of France and various rulers of southern German states who were opposed to Prussian dominance of the unified Germany that later emerged.[MASK] While limited material from them had been made public in 1871, they were otherwise inaccessible to historians in the almost half-century that followed and remained ‘a little historical enigma’.[MASK] Among those credited with the inclusion of this item in the treaty was the politician, writer and Dreyfusard Joseph Reinach.[CITATION-72]","Le Figaro, 25 June 1919.",1
13,1.0,F. Brisset-Foucault,"Talkative Polity: Radio, Domination and Citizenship in Uganda",0,"simply: why did so much energy and time go into public speaking and writing about a complex plan for elections in an authoritarian state? That elections were seen to be important is striking; that there was a degree of public disagreement about how they should be held is even more so. The answer suggested here is that the media coverage of the elections was in itself a kind of political work. When Basil Bataringaya—former opposition politician turned government stalwart—told Uganda’s parliament that ‘elections serve a useful purpose in nation-building, in the mobilisation of political consciousness and in the control of leaders’, both his speech and its subsequent reproduction on radio and in the press made claims about Bataringaya himself and about Uganda’s politics that spoke to a specific audience.[MASK] In Uganda, as elsewhere in Africa, newspapers have been seen as lacking in critical freedom, and vulnerable to government control—whether because of direct ownership by government or ruling party (as in the case of, one of Uganda’s two national English-language newspapers) or because the foreign companies that owned them were reluctant to fall foul of independent African governments (as in the case of the, the other national English-language paper, which from 1967 was part of the Lonrho group).[MASK] The history of Uganda’s media has been cast as a ‘struggle for freedom’ between a controlling government and a body of journalists dedicated to liberal principles.[MASK] Yet the boundaries between journalists, politicians, civil servants and party activists were often unclear, and from their beginnings in the early twentieth century Ugandan newspapers had largely been created to pursue particular political agendas rather than any abstract notion of freedom.[MASK] Vulnerability did not make newspapers irrelevant: constrained in their content and read only by a literate minority, they nonetheless provided a public forum for that minority, who read the press closely as they navigated the perils of a politically tumultuous time.Radio broadcasts in Amin’s Uganda have been characterised as part of a ‘politics of exhortation’ aimed at the population as a whole.[MASK] Elsewhere in Africa it has been argued that, where the print media is closely constrained by the state, journalists learn to write to ‘naturalise the authority of state officials’; Marissa Moorman has noted of Angola that ‘state broadcasters have national ambitions’.[MASK] But it is not clear that the imagined national audience was always listening, or reading. Moorman has also noted that listening communities were actually diverse, and another recent study has suggested that media work can produce multiple distinct ‘publics’.[MASK] The debate over Document Number Five suggests that writing and broadcasting in the English language allowed a relatively discrete group of broadcasters, writers and readers to assert—and argue over—their distinctive place in Ugandan politics. In pretending to speak to the nation, they were talking to, and about, one another. Like Florence Brisset-Foucault’s recent study of radio talk shows in twenty-first century Uganda, this is an investigation of what could, and could not be said—and of the role of public statements in claiming political authority.[CITATION-13]","F.

Decades of often sectarian ‘boss politics’ provided an ideal foil for Liberal activism, and the Liberal group grew from four councillors in 1970 to forty-six in 1973, when the party supplanted Labour to form a minority administration.[MASK] Greaves, a geography teacher at Colne Grammar School, put similar techniques into practice in his home borough of Pendle, where the Liberals also became the largest party.[MASK] Across the country as a whole, the 1973 elections saw more than 1,400 Liberal councillors elected, about 6 per cent of the total, as the party took control of Eastbourne and held the balance of power in several other boroughs, including Leeds and Bury.[MASK] By this point, the national political mood was also turning strongly in the Liberals’ favour.The Liberals’ experiments in community politics took place against the backdrop of the Heath government’s efforts to achieve a ‘quiet revolution’ in the British economy by cutting taxes, taming trade union power, and unleashing the dynamism of the private sector.[MASK] Heath’s concern about the political impact of rising unemployment in 1971–2 prompted his famous ‘u-turn’ towards reflation, with the ‘Barber boom’ accompanied by a statutory incomes policy and repeated efforts to reach a bargain with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Trades Union Congress (TUC). Keith Middlemas has characterised 1972–4 as the last and boldest attempt to reverse the UK’s relative economic decline through corporatist co-operation: ‘a strategic attempt to rethink the nature of … the postwar settlement’ which was undermined by bitter rows over the government’s Industrial Relations Act, housing finance reforms and regressive tax policies.[MASK] The OPEC oil embargo and Heath’s confrontation with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) brought matters to a head in the winter of 1973–4; indeed, the economist Michael Stewart thought this period ‘saw the opening up of class divides and the emergence of social antagonisms on a scale probably not witnessed since the General Strike half a century before’.[MASK] Heath’s unpopularity and perceived divisiveness created new opportunities for the Liberals. If the role of the state in a modern economy was to hold the ring between capital and labour, as Heath’s rhetoric increasingly suggested, then the Liberals could reasonably question whether either Labour or the Conservatives were sufficiently independent to define and represent the national interest.[CITATION-48]","‘In all his utterances’ from mid-1972 onwards, John Campbell has written, Heath ‘emphasized the idea of the Government as the trustee of the national interest, actively mediating between the two sides of industry as the representative of the consumer, the pensioners and the non-unionised’: J.

Wanume Kibedi—lawyer, and an aspiring UPC politician—reportedly told one seminar that the conference decision should be respected, but also that ‘it was important to keep the leader of the Revolution in direct contact with the masses’, as party delegates might be bought off with ‘foreign money’ but ‘the masses’ could not be bought.[MASK] In an issue ofthat editorialised on the virtues of the 1 + 3 system, Okello Oculi published a piece in which he questioned the very idea of elections by universal suffrage:Cannot each village, each county, each district sit down and agree on who should lead? Did not traditional Africa have mechanisms for selecting the best of each generation to be leaders of clans?’[MASK] His argument rehearsed the concern over popular ignorance, but drew a conclusion that looked to other international exemplars as well as the idea of a distinctive African political culture:Voters in Pakwach, in Omoro, in Busia, in Kisoro will not know which candidates has [] betrayed the country’s interests in dealing with which foreign company … The voters are kept ignorant. They vote the man in. Where is the hygiene in our politics? …We may be accused of showing no respect for the good judgment of the people, the common man. Our answer is that it is worse to play games and tricks with the common man. The Cubans do not have elections, but they are building one of the healthiest societies in the world today. The Chinese do not have elections and yet they are without the poverty, the rate of crime, the rate of mental illnesses and the rate of racial hatred and conflict in America today.At another seminar, Dent Ocaya-Lakidi—another political scientist recently returned from masters study, in his case in Toronto—reportedly cast further doubt on the value of elections: saying that ‘irrational forces were likely to turn things back to where they were unless a deliberate attempt was made to control them’. If elections were necessary to guide the people away from tribalism, they should be held only once, after which those elected should serve as a perpetually self-refreshing electoral college.[MASK] This chorus of doubt was abruptly quelled in early October 1970. It was replaced by a discussion of the party elections that reaffirmed the idea that the ballot could teach both people and politicians how to pursue a genuinely national politics.

Firstly, the Young Liberal Movement (YLs) had boomed as a result of an influx of left-leaning students who were attracted by Thorpe’s attacks on apartheid and angered by the Wilson government’s equivocations over the Vietnam War.[MASK] Attempts to commit the party to an anti-NATO stance at its 1966 Assembly led the media to label YL activists as ‘Red Guards’, and the leading role which Hain and other YLs played in the Stop the Seventy Tour campaign against the white South African cricket team kept the movement in the limelight in the run-up to the 1970 election. Some older Liberals, such as Arthur Slack of the National Union of Liberal Clubs, blamed the YLs for the party’s losses in 1970, and matters came to a head later in the year when the former YL chairman Louis Eaks was widely accused of stoking antisemitism.[MASK] Thorpe responded by commissioning Stephen Terrell QC to lead a controversial and largely fruitless inquiry into the YLs and their relationship with the wider party.[CITATION-28]","T.

She described how ‘so many grievous passages’ had happened to her since she was last happy, with her only comfort now being the love and joy of her family, friends and children. Dormer recognised that her natural temperament inclined towards ‘dejection’ and that this had an impact on her physical health, causing her ‘greate want of sleepe’ and ‘vapours’ around the spleen. Dormer, however, did not reconcile herself to this state of misery and ill health. In her letter, she outlined strategies she used to combat her sadness. As well as diverting her attention to the care of her ‘sweet children’, she altered her diet in a bid to raise her spirits. She told her sister how she found ‘a dish of chocolate’ to be the ‘greatest cordiall ... in the world’ for her condition.[MASK] This article explores the early modern connections between emotional health and eating to which Dormer’s consumption of chocolate alludes—connections that have thus far received scant historical analysis. Rather than just being a particular food preference, chocolate was known as a foodstuff that could stimulate feelings of joy and happiness while suppressing those of grief and sadness. Henry Stubbes, an English physician who extolled the virtues of chocolate in print, claimed that nothing freed the body of superfluous humours better. Chocolate, so Stubbes argued, ‘chears the Spirits, begets good Blood, and opens all the Emunctories of the body’.[MASK] Anne Dormer took chocolate to safeguard her emotional health, believing that it would provide her with comfort and help stir more positive passions, such as cheerfulness, while banishing her unhappiness.Dormer’s conceptualisation of chocolate as comforting is just one example of many that demonstrate that ‘comfort eating’ was a prominent feature of early modern preventative healthcare. This article examines the notion of comforting foods and practices of comfort eating in early modern England and engages with and builds on histories of the body, emotions, food and medicine. It argues for a culturally and historically specific concept of comfort eating, which differs substantially from modern definitions. While the primary function of eating was to allay hunger, comfort eating was practised to alleviate anxiety and promote happiness. Foods that were deemed comforting—that is, foods that had the ability to ease discomfort, which was characterised by feelings of sorrow, as well as, at times, by physical distress—were often distinguished by certain properties that engendered particular bodily sensations, such as satisfaction and pleasure, and helped balance other substances in the body, including the four humours.[MASK] Because of the early modern body’s material fluidity, the passions were constantly in danger of disruption, meaning people had to invest daily labour, such as practices of comfort eating, in their management.[CITATION-4]","U.

The Royal Insurance Company agreed to bear some or all the risks of the’s voyagejust one of many voyages the company insured in which the state had a vested interest—which further redistributed the voyage’s risks among close allies of the Crown.[MASK] When thewas seized in Dartmouth, the companies were left to fight among themselves in picking up the pieces, while the state bore none of the losses.Marble was a crucial medium in crafting the ‘image’ of the Sun King—explored famously by Peter Burke—but the case of theexemplifies how its procurement could defy the very values of order andit was intended to promulgate: both companies emerged, operated and disputed with each other within an environment of political precarity, both at Versailles and beyond the bounds of France.[MASK] Such precarity ensured that, once they had outlived their use in undermining Dutch supremacy in their given industry, these companies were discarded unceremoniously by the state, without concern for the costs to those with a stake in them. We can see this play out in the Crown’s intervention in the dispute, where Seignelay successfully interceded on the Royal Insurance Company’s behalf. No doubt on his encouragement, the king signed letters of safe conduct to spare the directors from imprisonment, while a later order of the Council of State was issued to protect the Royal Insurance Company’s interests by ordering that the dispute be taken before arbiters. Conversely, Louvois saw no need to protect the Royal Marble Company’s interests: Montgrand de Mazade noted that, ‘[with] the war of 1688 taking place, the entrepreneurs [of the Royal Marble Company] discontinued the supply [of marble] by order ofde Louvois’.[MASK] ‘Evidently’, as Geneviève Bresc-Bautier puts it, ‘the transport of extravagant marble was no longer a priority’, especially since thewas not the only vessel sent from Genoa in 1688 by the Royal Marble Company to encounter problems returning to France.[MASK] With the company no longer able to serve its function, and the royal workshops having an ample stockpile of marble to draw on during the war, it ceased to be useful to the state.[MASK] By contrast, the Royal Insurance Company sat at the heart of Seignelay’s commercial policy and, with the outbreak of the Nine Years War, the Secretary was just getting started in exploiting the institution in service of state interests. The Crown’s support for the Royal Insurance Company in the dispute was hence a matter of crude political expediency; the Colbert clan’s modest ‘victory’ over the Le Tellier clan here must be interpreted accordingly.Indeed, the tide would soon turn, with the Royal Insurance Company sharing the fate of its adversary at the turn of the century. The Nine Years War hit the institution hard, with 529 insurance claims submitted in the years 1689 to 1692 alone (see),[CITATION-101]","These are the only years from the war where the records have survived: AN, Z/1d/82, Royal Insurance Company’s register for declarations of average and abandonment, 1686–91; Z/1d/88, Royal Insurance Company’s register for declarations of average and abandonment, 1691–2.",1

According to Elyot the most ‘convenient’ foods to eat to avoid melancholy were those that ‘be temperate in heate, but specially they that be moyst’.[MASK] The crusts of bread, which were deemed ‘verie drie’, could engender melancholy, as could other overly dry foods such as coleworts and cabbages—these had ‘a drying and binding facultie’ that engendered a ‘grosse and Melancholicke blood’.[MASK] As well as avoiding dry foods, readers of health regimens were also advised to incorporate certain foods into their diets to prevent the onset of melancholy. Cogan recommended that those who were predisposed to melancholy, such as the elderly, who had naturally drier and colder bodies, should drink wine moderately as it ‘maketh them merry and represseth melancholinesse’.[MASK] Melancholy was not the only illness of the passions that could be avoided through careful management of diet. The passion of anger, if excessive, was believed to be particularly harmful.[MASK] According to the puritan theologian John Downame, anger was the result of ‘heating of the bloud about the hart’ and should be avoided at all costs.[MASK] Anger could be precipitated by a number of things, including jealousy, pride and inordinate desire, and could lead to trembling limbs, reddening of the face and gnashing of teeth.[MASK] Anger, if not moderated and properly controlled, was also thought to lead to a loss of reason which in turn could result in a descent into madness.[MASK] Given its alarming consequences, advice about how to avoid anger was widespread in moralistic and medical texts. Downame noted in his discussion of anger that ‘wise Physitions thinke it the better & safer course to preserve health and prevent sicknesse, then to remove the disease after it hath taken possession of the body’.[MASK] As with most medical advice in the early modern period, then, prevention was believed to be better than a cure.As with melancholy, there were a variety of means by which anger could be avoided but diet was once again a key consideration. Those of a choleric constitution were more prone to bouts of anger, as their bodies were already overly hot and dry.[MASK] Anything that increased body heat beyond normal levels could result in the production of heat around the heart and the passion of anger. Similarly, for those unaccustomed to hot, dry foods, eating an abundance of foods that could increase levels of choler in the body could also leave them vulnerable to the disease of anger. Foods that had the potential to increase choler included onions, garlic, honey, pepper and mustard.[MASK] These foods were believed to be particularly heating and drying and thus matched the elemental qualities of the hot, dry humour choler. Describing garlic, the herbalist John Gerard noted that it is ‘very sharpe, hot, and dry’, warning that those ‘of a hot complexion must especially abstaine from it’.[MASK] Other foods with similar properties that physicians and herbalists recommended avoiding to keep choler, and the associated passion of anger, at bay included salt, leeks, mint, thick wine and heating spices.[CITATION-66]","William Bullein, Bulleins Bulwarke of Defence Against all Sicknesse (London, 1579), fo. 71; Gerard, Herball, p. 175; John Parkinson, Theatrum Botanicum: The Theater of Plants (London, 1640), p. 35; Boorde, Compendyous Regyment, sig.

Moorman has also noted that listening communities were actually diverse, and another recent study has suggested that media work can produce multiple distinct ‘publics’.[MASK] The debate over Document Number Five suggests that writing and broadcasting in the English language allowed a relatively discrete group of broadcasters, writers and readers to assert—and argue over—their distinctive place in Ugandan politics. In pretending to speak to the nation, they were talking to, and about, one another. Like Florence Brisset-Foucault’s recent study of radio talk shows in twenty-first century Uganda, this is an investigation of what could, and could not be said—and of the role of public statements in claiming political authority.[MASK] The focus here is therefore on newspapers and radio broadcasts in the English language—not because these were the only forum for political debates among Ugandans (these went on in many ways, in multiple languages) but because they were central to public self-representation by Uganda’s elite.That approach allows us to consider the protagonists, at least in part, as they saw themselves—as intellectuals, whose statements made claims about themselves as ‘educators of the masses’ (as one of them put it).[MASK] Those involved included a spy master with aspirations to be a poet, the editor of a critical arts magazine, sundry academics, angry students and a wider cast of politicians and civil servants. This ‘small restless group’—as one of their own number later called them—used their talk about elections to assert a profoundly tutelary understanding of politics.[MASK] This valorised their shared claim to authority—as they talked and wrote, they cast the people of Uganda as holders of sovereign authority, yet also as subjects in need of education. Voters, they argued, did not fully understand the consequences of their choices. Vulnerable to political opportunists, the electorate required instruction.At the same time, the media reportage revealed both self-fashioning and a project of mutual discipline by that group of literate English-speakers. Uganda had a considerable press in other languages—notably Luganda, spoken in Uganda’s economic and governmental centre, the former southern kingdom of Buganda, where there had been a lively and enthusiastically political press since the early colonial period.[MASK] By the mid-1960s newspapers and radio were, as one observer noted, ‘a necessity for the educated elite and influentials’, and English-language media carried a particular weight—despite their modest circulation.[CITATION-17]","Ocitti, Press Politics and Public Policy, p. 38; also A.

As in moments of grief, the types of foods shared at a funerary meal mapped onto ideas about what constituted comforting foods. Sweet foods, such as cakes and biscuits, that provoked pleasure, alcoholic beverages that could cheer the spirits and nourishing meats that could promote the production of good blood all regularly featured in funerary meals.[MASK] The gifting and sharing of healthy or desirable foods were thus central to affective bonds and emotional health in the early modern period. Exchanging food allowed individuals to express concern for the emotional well-being of their loved ones while also providing a practical solution that they hoped would help alleviate those suffering from grief, melancholy and sorrow. Foods that were deemed comforting were those that delighted the senses, providing nourishment to bodies awash with unbalanced humours, and those that were enticing to particular palates, whether that be young Isaac’s sweet cakes, Barrington’s health-giving capons or Josselin’s much-desired calf’s head.Comfort eating was at the centre of preventative healthcare aimed at managing the passions. Eating the correct types of food and in the right quantity could stave off unwanted negative passions, keeping the body balanced and its constituent material components in equilibrium. As well as protecting the body from negative passions, food also had the power to cultivate the more positive passion of cheerfulness, which was itself integral to good health. These medical ideas about food, and its relationship to good emotional health, shaped people’s social engagements with food, encouraging individuals to gift health-giving foodstuffs to their loved ones, and share food to stimulate joy and mirth and ease suffering during moments of emotional turmoil. Comfort eating was thus part of long-term approaches to preventative emotional healthcare, giving individuals a degree of control over their bodies and a means by which they could safeguard the health of their passions.For those who failed to control their emotional health by establishing daily practices of comfort eating, and ultimately succumbed to disorders of the passions, there were alternative methods of restoring their passions to good health. Because of the connections between the humours, the passions and the six non-natural things in early modern medical thought, maintaining good emotional health and curing disorders of the passions if they took hold required extensive knowledge of the natural world and its produce, and a thorough understanding of how certain ingredients interacted with bodily matter. Recipe books from the period attest to this knowledge, demonstrating that emotional health was often managed at the household level, incorporating information gleaned from published medical tracts and herbals, and from everyday experience of collecting plants and creating medicaments.[MASK] Producing recipes with ingredients that had the power to comfort the passions was thus part of broader early modern medical knowledge and another important dimension of comfort-eating practices.Of all the emotional disorders that feature in early modern recipe books, melancholy, and its various cures, is undoubtedly the most common. Cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger were familiar ingredients in medicaments for melancholy.[CITATION-116]","London, Wellcome Trust [hereafter WT], MS.4338, recipe book of Johanna St John, c.1680, fo. 182; MS.2477, recipe book of J.

This threatened to undermine state sovereignty in metropolitan France itself and contributed to a broader destabilisation of the conceptual divide between war and peace in pre-modern political thought and legal practice.Seen in this context, the conflict was the product of the state’s ability to manage risks through establishing business relations with close allies. Nevertheless, it emerged from, and drew unwanted attention to, both state weaknesses in the maritime sphere and the space within French commerce for a plurality of understandings of war and peace. The ambiguous resolution to the dispute had implications that fomented further conflict across France up to the end of the Old Regime.By the seventeenth century, marine insurance had already become firmly entrenched in commercial centres across Europe. The oldest known policy was issued in Genoa on 20 February 1343, transferring risks at sea to the underwriter in exchange for an agreed sum (i.e. the premium).[MASK] From the Italian states, insurance migrated across the Mediterranean and later northwards.[MASK] By the time the policy on thewas signed, Amsterdam was firmly established as Europe’s leading insurance market. London was already a major centre too: together with the Royal Exchange, Edward Lloyd’s coffeehouse was just emerging as a significant space for the negotiation of insurance policies and the dissemination of maritime information.[MASK] The rise of insurance across Europe had not been without controversy. Early scholastic thought, focusing on the aleatory nature of insurance, had placed insurance in the same semantic field as gambling, enshrining a broader moral suspicion of insurance and other similar business instruments, such as bills of exchange.[MASK] Francesca Trivellato has recently documented the rise of an antisemitic legend in seventeenth-century France concerning the origins of insurance and the bill of exchange. In the case of insurance, this was a prejudiced manifestation of French society’s anxieties about the scope for underwriters to renege on their commitments—and the potential for this to bring about the policyholder’s financial ruin.[MASK] In turn, policyholders could exploit information asymmetries to the detriment of underwriters: they could, for example, conceal information about the seaworthiness of a vessel to secure more favourable terms. Taking such asymmetries to their extreme, policyholders could even over-insure a vessel with multiple unwitting underwriters and then deliberately sink it, walking away with a handsome profit.[MASK] Moral hazard—that is, the capacity for parties to enter an insurance policy in bad faith—thus underpinned the instrument’s capacity to engender chaos in commercial life.[MASK] As a tool for managing risk, insurance was itself risky.The two companies in thedispute operated within this environment of suspicion towards insurance. Although surprisingly little has been written about it, the Royal Insurance Company was entirely typical of the privileged corporate model exploited by the French state in the 1680s.[CITATION-16]","I give the company the attention it deserves in Wade, Privilege, Economy and State.",1

Okello Oculi hailed the process, and Document Number Five, as an exemplary success for Africa.[MASK] Others took up the notion that Uganda was engaged in a collective electoral demonstration for a sceptical international audience: as another UK-trained lawyer-turned-Makerere academic put it, ‘[t]he enthusiasm, the eagerness, readiness and the promptitude that animated the electorate and the elected must have staggered the British press’.[MASK] Meanwhile, the idea of the common man was being elaborated by others working in the ‘Research Section’, which had briefly become a sort of intellectual hub for young radicals.[MASK] To be a Common Man was not just a default condition, but a set of attitudes that must be learned: as a speaker from the Research Section reportedly told school pupils, the ‘Common Man was any law-abiding citizen who believed in the territorial sovereignty political and eventually economic independence of Uganda and contributed to the development of his country as an indivisible unit’.[MASK] Obote’s close ally, Sam Odaka, called for ‘mass education irrespective of age’, noting the importance to the Common Man’s Charter of a ‘willingness to learn’.[MASK] In the wake of those party elections, Obote called for consideration of his revised presidential election proposals in a rapid series of meetings in December 1970: the party executive, followed by the National Council, then an emergency delegates’ conference. Obote’s careful explanation that these revisions did not conflict with the August decision, but simply provided a way to make party supremacy compatible with the sovereignty of the people, was read out in full on the radio, and published in.[MASK] The proposals made presidential nomination reliant on the support of multiple constituency party branches, so that the chances of an effective challenge to Obote were vanishingly small—in effect they doubled down on the premise that voting was a useful way to teach people citizenship and ensure presidential legitimacy, but only if voters were protected from unsuitable candidates. Direct press coverage of the question resumed: the president of the Makerere Students’ Guild, Tumusiime Mutebile, was given space in theto write an article declaring that the rejection of Obote’s proposals ‘amounted to defranchising [] the citizens of Uganda’; another academic was reported indenouncing his local party branch for issuing a statement that opposed direct elections.[MASK] In advance of the meetings bothand therepeatedly carried editorials that endorsed the new proposals.[MASK] reminded its readers of the gaze of an international audience suspicious of one-party rule:We say we are going to be a one-party state.

As the Socialist mayor of Narbonne, Ernest Ferroul, put it on 16 June 1907:Forgetting our fratricidal wars and whatever has divided us until now, we are defending the native land, the nourishing soil and its products. Is it not legitimate? When the black flag flies over our town halls, when we are demanding Right and Justice, one is sniggering, saying we are reactionaries. We are not monarchists, opportunists, radicals, or socialists anymore; we are nothing but Southerners who demand the right to live.[MASK] Unity was the order of the day and the leaders of the movement as well as professional organisations insisted on fostering class collaboration. For the majority of demonstrators concurred on one fundamental point: it was up to the unitary Republic to save her southern constituents. Even where Occitan appeared to supplant French as the language of contention, such vocal assertion of regional identity did not entail a rejection of the universalist Republic.[MASK] The regionalist interpretation of the 1907 events gained a new vigour in the 1970s when Occitanist organisations rose from the ashes of earlier regionalist movements.[MASK] In these post-1968 reconstructions, even though the mutiny of the 17th Infantry Regiment had only lasted a day, it assumed a paradigmatic value: here was a regiment largely made up of men born and bred around Béziers, who had stood up to the coercive machine of the nation-state to demonstrate where their loyalty lay by refusing to suppress the revolt of their kith and kin. Regionalists, though, remain as misleading as Eugen Weber, who refused to acknowledge that the events of 1907 provided a corrective to his modernising model. In many ways, the protesters had indeed demonstrated their acculturation to the national and Republican political culture. But the mutiny, as well as the resignation of municipal councils across the region, also illustrated the age-old tension between legality and legitimacy. For popular sovereignty was not here understood in the conventional terms of Republican universalism: the nation-state was not the exclusive object of political loyalty and never fully subsumed other territorial forms of political identities. The revolt showed that the legitimacy of the Republican state was dependent upon its capacity to represent the interests of its constituent parts. Republicanism, in this context, cannot be reduced to the formal, universalist ideological construction promoted by the intellectual elites of the Third Republic since its inception. It is rather better understood as a specific type of the democratic political culture which defined the legitimate forms of political contention and claim-making.[MASK] The mutineers had indeed demonstrated in the most dramatic fashion that popular sovereignty had communal roots which Republican institutions, including the army, could simply not afford to ignore. Clemenceau, himself a representative of a southern constituency in the Var, patently understood that the repressive measures he had used the previous year against striking miners in the north were unlikely, on their own, to quell the revolt of the south.[CITATION-39]","O.

It sets out to study popular patriotism in its own terms and contends that urban history offers a productive way to situate patriotic mobilisation in the local and national contexts in which it took place. Indeed, this article argues that wartime patriotism ought to be considered as part of a larger reflection on the political and cultural geography of France in the era of the Great War. Historians of the First World War long assumed that the process of nationalisation of the French polity had reached its apex in August 1914. In recent years, however, a string of works on France and Germany have demonstrated that nation-making and processes of centralisation had not entailed the withering of local identities.[MASK] The urban history of wartime mobilisation offers a fruitful way to study the articulation of national and infra-national identities and to rescue patriotism from the idealistic and exclusionary definition that nationalists sought to impose upon their contemporaries and historians alike. Moreover, this article suggests that a decentred approach to national mobilisation, focusing on peripheral and, in this case, southern regions of France, may shed critical light on the nature and process of national mobilisation.The distinctions between nationalism and patriotism, between theand patriotic mobilisation are not simply of relevance to continuing historiographical debate. In present-day commemorative contexts, they are also critical if historians are to challenge successfully the growing assertion of regionalist and essentialist definitions of social identities that threaten to undermine public understanding of the conflict. It is indeed striking to see how the centenary of the war and the flurry of activities, events and publications it generated, reactivated conventional as well as regional narratives of victimisation. These also built on and appropriated the kind of rhetoric deployed by those activists and intellectuals who have rightly been calling for France to reckon with the crimes and moral legacies of its imperialist ventures.[MASK] Like those who legitimately agitate for the integration of colonial soldiers into the national memory of the war, regionalist writers have evoked soldiers of Languedoc, Corsica, Brittany or the Basque country as sacrificial victims of the French centralising and nationalising project.[MASK] In this regard, France is just another example of a multicultural society grappling with the memory of wars fought in the name of the nation-state. Yet, historians of the Breton or southern experiences of the war also lend credence to such regionalist interpretations when they appear to endorse theas an ideal-type of national mobilisation.[MASK] This article draws on a rich scholarly field in which historians of the urban experience of the war have, over the last two decades, framed their contributions in both local and comparative terms.[CITATION-25]","R.

The national party would support the effort to build ‘a Liberal power base in the major cities of this country’ by taking ‘an aggressive political lead on issues of moral concern, injustice and oppression’, identifying the Liberals with ‘the underprivileged of this country and the world’ and using these campaigns ‘to publicise Liberal attitudes and policies’. In due course, this strategy would prepare the party to fight the next general election ‘on the broadest possible front’.[MASK] The community politics strategy which emerged during the early 1970s opened up common ground between New Left-influenced YLs and urban councillors, and helped shift the focus of the party’s activities from Parliament to local government and the regions. Lishman wrote a ‘community politics guide’ for circulation to local parties, and the party set out to target major gains in the 1973 local elections, when voters in England and Wales would elect members of the new county and district councils created by the 1972 Local Government Act.[MASK] Though Thorpe and other MPs treated the Eastbourne strategy with caution, Richard Wainwright—who had become chairman of the national executive after losing his Colne Valley seat—began to reshape the party’s policy and organisation to support extra-parliamentary campaigning. For instance, during the winter of 1971–2 Wainwright launched an ‘Action on Hardship’ campaign to highlight the party’s concern for low-paid workers, while the YLs ran a campaign on the ‘Urban Crisis’ which called for a new participatory approach to housing and planning.[MASK] Wainwright hoped to use these campaigns to build links with the ‘poverty lobby’ groups which had emerged in response to the ‘rediscovery of poverty’ during the 1960s, such as Shelter and the Child Poverty Action Group.[MASK] The initial response from the voluntary sector was ‘not … very favourable’, but the campaigns seem to have helped re-engage some wavering party members.[MASK] David Steel also persuaded Shelter’s founding director Des Wilson to join the party in order to stand as the Liberal candidate for Hove in a 1973 by-election.[MASK] High-intensity ‘pavement politics’ yielded its biggest dividends in Liverpool, where Cyril Carr and Trevor Jones usedleaflets and ‘grumble sheets’ to exploit voters’ frustration with poor housing conditions and other council services. Decades of often sectarian ‘boss politics’ provided an ideal foil for Liberal activism, and the Liberal group grew from four councillors in 1970 to forty-six in 1973, when the party supplanted Labour to form a minority administration.[CITATION-42]","M.

It does, however, aim to show how the experience of the meridional periphery may illuminate the larger process of national mobilisation when we combine different scales of analysis.[MASK] On 21 June 1907, soldiers of the 17th Infantry Regiment left their barracks in Agde and marched to Béziers in protest against the suppression of the local winegrowers’ revolt. Their mutiny was the climax of a crisis which had been convulsing the southern part of France since March of that year. The mutineers improvised a billet in the heart of the town, where they were photographed, holding the butts of their rifles aloft, surrounded by townsmen and women. This remains, to this day, one of the most enduring images conjured up by the name of Béziers. The mutiny of the soldiers of the 17th went on to gain iconic status in the French pacifist tradition, thanks to a song composed soon after the events by Montéhus.[MASK] These soldiers, recruited and stationed in the local area, had come to embody the unreliable nature of the southern regions, whose local identity was deemed to threaten the integrity of the French nation-state. The challenge they so dramatically issued to the military authorities underlines the problematic nature of the relationship between the expression of peripheral and national identities in France at the turn of the twentieth century. When the First World War broke out, however, Béziers and its surrounding district () responded unreservedly to the call to arms. In this particular context, the indisputable success of national mobilisation calls into question conventional interpretations of the processes of the creation of the nation. It also invites us to rethink our understanding of patriotism and to place wartime mobilisation in the broader context of social mobilisation and contention in the early twentieth century.Béziers, known as the ‘wine capital’, stood at the heart of a region entirely dedicated to wine-growing and was a major centre of the national and European wine markets.[MASK] A few indicators illustrate the extent to which the economic destiny of the town was inseparable from the success of the local intoxicant. In 1914, the department of the Hérault, where Béziers is located, accounted for more than a quarter of the national wine production (27.9 per cent). In theof Béziers, vines covered 77.7 per cent of the land and generated 90.4 per cent of local revenue. 67.5 per cent of the municipality’s area was devoted to wine-growing.[MASK] The town’s dependency on the wine market had first been dramatically demonstrated between 1873 and 1881 when phylloxera—a vine pest—destroyed a large part of the vineyards of southern France. Eventually restored thanks to the import of Californian grafts, the local winemaking industry then took a decidedly capitalist turn. Although the modernisation of the local economy ushered in a prosperous ‘Golden Age’ in the last ten years of the nineteenth century, it also entrenched for decades to come the town’s dependency on the wine market; a vulnerability which was to be illustrated by the 1907 uprising.[CITATION-32]","R.

As the discussions at the Paris Peace Conference demonstrate, many archaeologists had internalised the idea that indigenous populations were incapable of caring for the antiquities on their territories.The British Academy saw the Paris Peace Conference as an opportunity to lobby for the interests of its members and ensure that they retained access to antique sites in the future. In November 1918, the academy led a joint action by British learned societies, who collectively approved a resolution stating that the peace conference should end the ‘systematic neglect and destruction of antiquities, and the obstruction of scientific exploration and excavation’ which had prevailed under Ottoman rule.[MASK] Under the lead of the British Academy, a committee of experts called the Archaeological Joint Committee (AJC) was formed to develop a policy and lobby the Foreign Office. The academy’s president, Sir Frederic Kenyon, believed that Britain had ‘a national responsibility for the records and relics of ancient civilization in those countries’.[MASK] In a memorandum sent to the Foreign Office in January 1919, Kenyon argued for the necessity of international access to antiquities because collections in ‘England, France, or Italy, for example, can be easily visited by scholars of all countries, and there are large publics in each of these countries who can understand and profit by the exhibition of them’, unlike in the territories of the former Ottoman Empire.[MASK] Kenyon reiterated these thoughts in a private letter to Lord Curzon, leader of the House of Lords and future Foreign Secretary, a few weeks later, arguing that objects such as cuneiform tablets were ‘useless unless they can be brought to countries where they can be studied’.[MASK] Both Curzon and Balfour were fellows of the Academy, which undoubtedly helped its case.Similar ideas emerged in the United States. In December 1918, James H. Breasted, a key figure in the development of American Egyptology, presented a proposal to the American Historical Association to ‘safeguard the future of scientific research, exploration and excavation’ in the former Ottoman Empire. Breasted argued that the ‘Near East … bequeathed our own civilization to Europe’ but warned that the ‘processes of normal life’ under the successors to the Ottoman Empire would result in the ‘wide destruction of ancient monuments’.[MASK] Breasted had a racial worldview which informed his attitudes to both the war and archaeology.[MASK] The archaeologist Howard Crosby Butler wrote a report on the matter as part of his work with the American government’s expert group, The Inquiry. Butler argued that, were independence granted to ‘the peoples of Anatolia, Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and Arabia … they would probably interfere with, or hamper, scientific investigation on the part of the foreigners’.[MASK] Both American and British plans reflected a deep-rooted belief that the populations of the former Ottoman Empire could not care for the antiquities in their territories.

John Pardoe, for instance, warned in lurid terms that Britain was ‘approaching that situation of “explosive inflation” which has been experienced in so many South American countries’, which would be ‘a danger to our society, to our politics, to our Parliamentary Institutions, to our very democracy’. Though he rejected monetarism on the grounds that mass unemployment was unacceptable, he argued that ‘the menace of inflation must be met; met hard; and met now’, and accused the Labour Chancellor, Denis Healey, of attempting to evade the problem.[MASK] Faced with an interventionist Labour government and corporate alarm about a ‘profits squeeze’, some Liberal MPs also began to worry about the survival of the market economy. Pardoe declared that Labour’s attempt to hold down prices through controls and subsidies was ‘nuts’, while Wainwright warned that ‘Export-led growth cannot be achieved by State-shackled manufacturing industry’.[MASK] Even Thorpe claimed that Britain had become ‘a nation living beyond its means, with a standard of living which cannot be sustained by our current level of economic activity’. Sooner or later, the Liberal leader insisted, the government would have to be honest with the electorate about the need for sacrifice.[MASK] This gloomy analysis of Britain’s economic position meant that the Liberal message in the October 1974 campaign sat rather awkwardly with the glitzy style which Thorpe had chosen. The party had calculated that a vote share of 26–28 per cent would deliver a much larger block of MPs, and Thorpe hoped that his tour of target seats—first by hovercraft and then by helicopter—would help attract the media coverage required for a national breakthrough.[MASK] In addition to television news coverage, the Liberals gained sympathetic treatment from much of the press, which discussed the party’s manifesto ‘with unprecedented seriousness’ and covered Thorpe’s speeches at length.[MASK] Alastair Hetherington ofechoed the Liberal argument that ‘consensus’ could be ‘tough, progressive, and fair’, whileendorsed a GNU and,, and thesupported a Conservative–Liberal coalition with varying degrees of clarity.[MASK] By Liberal standards, the campaign was also well resourced, though the party was still poorer than its rivals.

For instance, during the winter of 1971–2 Wainwright launched an ‘Action on Hardship’ campaign to highlight the party’s concern for low-paid workers, while the YLs ran a campaign on the ‘Urban Crisis’ which called for a new participatory approach to housing and planning.[MASK] Wainwright hoped to use these campaigns to build links with the ‘poverty lobby’ groups which had emerged in response to the ‘rediscovery of poverty’ during the 1960s, such as Shelter and the Child Poverty Action Group.[MASK] The initial response from the voluntary sector was ‘not … very favourable’, but the campaigns seem to have helped re-engage some wavering party members.[MASK] David Steel also persuaded Shelter’s founding director Des Wilson to join the party in order to stand as the Liberal candidate for Hove in a 1973 by-election.[MASK] High-intensity ‘pavement politics’ yielded its biggest dividends in Liverpool, where Cyril Carr and Trevor Jones usedleaflets and ‘grumble sheets’ to exploit voters’ frustration with poor housing conditions and other council services. Decades of often sectarian ‘boss politics’ provided an ideal foil for Liberal activism, and the Liberal group grew from four councillors in 1970 to forty-six in 1973, when the party supplanted Labour to form a minority administration.[MASK] Greaves, a geography teacher at Colne Grammar School, put similar techniques into practice in his home borough of Pendle, where the Liberals also became the largest party.[MASK] Across the country as a whole, the 1973 elections saw more than 1,400 Liberal councillors elected, about 6 per cent of the total, as the party took control of Eastbourne and held the balance of power in several other boroughs, including Leeds and Bury.[MASK] By this point, the national political mood was also turning strongly in the Liberals’ favour.The Liberals’ experiments in community politics took place against the backdrop of the Heath government’s efforts to achieve a ‘quiet revolution’ in the British economy by cutting taxes, taming trade union power, and unleashing the dynamism of the private sector.[MASK] Heath’s concern about the political impact of rising unemployment in 1971–2 prompted his famous ‘u-turn’ towards reflation, with the ‘Barber boom’ accompanied by a statutory incomes policy and repeated efforts to reach a bargain with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Trades Union Congress (TUC). Keith Middlemas has characterised 1972–4 as the last and boldest attempt to reverse the UK’s relative economic decline through corporatist co-operation: ‘a strategic attempt to rethink the nature of … the postwar settlement’ which was undermined by bitter rows over the government’s Industrial Relations Act, housing finance reforms and regressive tax policies.[CITATION-46]","K.

As its name suggests, Carrara marble was sourced in and around the city of Carrara in north-western Italy. It was prized across the world for being of the highest quality, used even in the construction of the Taj Mahal.[MASK] This made it ideal for crafting statues for the French court, where mediocre marble from the Pyrenees was inadequate in expressing the glory and magnificence of the Sun King.[MASK] Nevertheless, the transport of marble from Carrara to France was a true logistical challenge, and the Royal Marble Company was supported in this undertaking by naval officials () and the consuls of the French nation in Genoa and Livorno.[MASK] With their support, theset sail from Genoa loaded with thirty-seven blocks () of marble, purchased for 8,755 livres.[MASK] If the voyage had gone to plan, thewould have arrived in Le Havre, at the mouth of the Seine, where the marble would have been loaded ontosmall vessels used to load and unload large ships—to be carried upstream to Rouen, and then loaded again onto river boats to be carried towards Paris. Following the terms of the contract, payment for this marble would have come only after its safe arrival, with three quarters paid when the marble arrived in Le Havre and the remaining quarter upon arrival in Paris.[MASK] But thenever reached Le Havre.

Harold Temperley, a historian and part of the British delegation, characterised Austrian protests as ‘a last plea for the Old Vienna as a centre of culture and a gracious citadel of art’.[MASK] Woodrow Wilson wrote privately of a ‘pathetic’ appeal that he had received from Vienna, noting his opposition to the ‘spoliation’ of collections for the damage that it would do to their ‘scientific value’.[MASK] Frederic Kenyon wrote to the British Foreign Office in late May 1919 to add his weight to the criticisms of Italian claims.[MASK] The art scholar Sidney Colvin wrote to the British Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, arguing that the Italian claims were ‘far beyond the limits of justice’.[MASK] The protests lodged against Italian claims in Austria all saw the nationalisation of cultural objects as problematic, because of both the difficulty of proving national ownership of cultural objects and the potential that, were this logic applied to all art collections, it could lead to museums across Europe and North America losing valuable objects in the future. Beyond these complex issues, British diplomats in Paris struggled to determine the truth of what was happening in Vienna. Harold Nicolson noted on 7 July that ‘we cannot be perfectly certain that the information which has reached us is accurate. We are certain, however, that the Italians have taken a large number of works of art away from Vienna.’[MASK] The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye contained six articles (191–6) relating to cultural issues, all of which appeared as ‘special provisions’ in the section dealing with reparations. Articles 191 and 192 required that Austria return ‘all records, documents, objects of antiquity and of art, and all scientific and bibliographical material’ which had been taken from both invaded territories and ceded territories since 1 June 1914. Article 193 required that Austria relinquish ‘all the records, documents and historical material possessed by public institutions which may have a direct bearing on the history of the ceded territories and which have been removed during the last ten years’ (extended to 1861 in the case of Italy). Article 195 stated that, within a year of the treaty coming into effect, the Reparation Commission would appoint a committee of three jurists to examine the manner in which the House of Habsburg came into possession of ‘objects or manuscripts in possession of Austria’ and arrange their restitution to Italy if required.The drafters of the Treaty of Saint-Germain decided that the best approach was not to require the return of named items in the treaty, but to defer decisions until after the signing of the treaty and to encourage bilateral agreements between states. Lord Cunliffe had suggested this as early as 21 February 1919.[MASK] In August 1919, Austria and Italy signed a series of agreements regarding reparation of cultural objects and archives: Austria committed to hand over to Italy unnamed works of art as a ‘just concession to public opinion’; Italy agreed that it would hand back three manuscripts ‘taken as security’ from the Hofbibliothek in Vienna.[CITATION-89]","TNA, FO 608/18, Agreements between Austria and Italy, 13 Aug. 1919.",1

Across the political spectrum, thoughts turned to post-war reconstruction. Social researchers were now in demand—and Charles Madge was a notable beneficiary. He had begun investigating the ‘social factors’ involved in economic decision-making in 1938, using the ethnographic field site that M-O had established in Bolton as his base.[MASK] Although he left M-O in 1940, he continued his project, working at what he called the ‘fruitful borderland between economics and social research’,[MASK] and his study fed into an investigation of regional spending patterns sponsored by J.M. Keynes and the National Council for Social and Economic Research (NCSER).[MASK] This resulted in a series of articles published in thefrom 1940 to 1941.[MASK] Keynes was eager to gain insights into working-class fiscal habits as he sketched out a new taxation policy, and Madge’s experience in this field now made him a sought-after figure.Madge’s study of distinct financial ‘cultures’ in Coventry, Bolton, Bristol, Glasgow, and Leeds demonstrated that individuals possessed their own rituals regarding money, which were strongly resistant to external change.[MASK] Nonetheless, they also possessed a strong ‘practical and empirical’ streak.[MASK] This had come to the fore in the war. Madge used oral testimony to illustrate how ordinary families had complied with household budget constraints, but had reframed them within existing patterns of working-class life. This problematised the vision of class struggle articulated by earlier left-wing figures.had framed itself as the intellectual vanguard needed to lead ordinary people in their inevitable struggle against the capitalist state. But Madge now believed working-class cultures were powerful and creative enough to organise themselves. He argued for a society structured so that the idiosyncratic patterns of social life which he had explored in the regions could be reproduced on a national basis.Michael Young was another left-wing sociologist who benefited from these new opportunities. Before the war Young had initially worked as a solicitor at McKenna and Company, before taking an Economics degree at the LSE, where he attended additional classes in political science, commercial law, and social and economic history.[MASK] At the same time, he also remained active in the world of London grass-roots socialism. There were strong links in the 1930s between the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA), the Labour Party, and local left-wing community projects, with which M-O itself had been involved.[MASK] Young was involved in these endeavours while at the LSE, through his activism with the Communist Party, and as a member of the WEA.[MASK] Young was particularly interested in exploring how the vibrancy of working-class culture might be encouraged. The war effort gave him an ideal opportunity to think this through, as community-based projects such as the WEA were co-opted into the expanded civil defence and military apparatus.[CITATION-53]","C.

The war effort gave him an ideal opportunity to think this through, as community-based projects such as the WEA were co-opted into the expanded civil defence and military apparatus.[MASK] He founded the state-funded Industrial Discussion Clubs Experiment in 1943, along witheditor Amabel Williams-Ellis and the Marxist art historian Alan Jarvis. These were essentially WEA discussion sessions replicated in a factory setting. As Jarvis later explained, their groups attempted to provide safe spaces where ‘the real contemporary problems of real people’ might come to the fore.[MASK] In 1939 Young secured a position as a researcher for Political and Economic Planning, the think-tank founded in 1931 by Max Nicholson. He began to study how the new institutions of the wartime state interacted with pre-existing patterns of working-class life, while ‘carrying out all sorts of welfare work’ in Blitz-era London.[MASK] His findings were presented in a PEP research pamphlet published in 1941 on the management of the wartime social services. Far from destroying them, Young found that the London County Council’s shelter policies had bolstered working-class initiatives. In Bermondsey, co-operation between ‘the local authority, the ARP organisations, voluntary bodies and representatives of the shelter population’ had produced a flourishing sense of community.[MASK] The council had distributed books and allocated more spaces for civic use. The community in turn used these to organise adult education classes, lead collective reading and wireless groups, and encourage workshops in painting and creative writing. State policy therefore did not ‘replace’ working-class culture, and could instead ‘provide new and richer opportunities’ for its development.[MASK] Moreover, it cut across the barriers imposed by socio-economic class. New community schemes helped to foster ‘unexpected sources of social leadership’, with working-class residents leading their middle-class neighbours in communal activities.[MASK] If properly planned, Young concluded, state policy could be used to allow every individual to have a fair stake in society.The wartime state provided socialist intellectuals with the opportunity to study everyday life at closer hand. Two different strands of thought arose from this. Madge believed that the ingenious working-class cultures he had valorised as acritic, and had carefully charted as an M-O and NCSER-sponsored sociologist, were entirely autonomous. They functioned at a family, and even an individual, level. The state therefore needed to use top-level planning to remove economic inequality, while allowing the free play of working-class individuality to proliferate from the bottom up. Young argued for close, micro-level linkages between local authorities and existing systems of working-class mutualism, in order to bolster an organic communal politics. As he later argued, it was in the kinship group of extended family, and ‘amongst friends at work, in the pub’ that ordinary people were most themselves; in short, were most individual.[CITATION-59]","CCA, YUNG 2/1/1, ‘Draft of Small Man, Big World’, 1948.",1

In October 1972, Cyril Smith gained Rochdale from Labour on the basis of a populist local campaign; in December, Graham Tope won the safe Conservative seat of Sutton and Cheam on a 33 per cent swing; and during 1973 the Liberals took the Isle of Ely, Ripon, and Berwick-upon-Tweed from the Tories. This gave them five by-election gains in just over a year, along with three very respectable second places.As Richard Jay has pointed out, the Liberals were ‘lucky in both the timing and the location of the by-elections’, which allowed them to harness the votes of disillusioned Conservatives just as they had done at Orpington in the early 1960s.[MASK] What was new, however, was the party’s ability to make progress in constituencies where it had no tradition of success and very little local organisation, such as the Labour-held seats of Chester-le-Street and Manchester Exchange, where it came a strong second. In some cases this reflected intensive campaign techniques (pioneered by the Liverpool councillor Trevor Jones and deployed to great effect at Sutton and Cheam) and the personal appeal of strong local candidates, but it also suggested a growing openness to the party’s national message, particularly as class-based loyalties started to wither. The political scientist Michael Steed, who stood as the Liberal candidate at Manchester Exchange, thought that ‘the key to the mood of the electorate was “the feeling of utter powerlessness”’.[MASK] Though many male manual workers in the constituency were still Labour partisans, their wives seemed more receptive to Steed’s campaign, not least because of dissatisfaction with the Labour-run city council over housing conditions.[MASK] Peter Hain also detected ‘a growing feeling of rootlessness’, which went hand in hand with ‘a deep antipathy towards modern, centralised Party machines’.[MASK] After jumping in the opinion polls during summer 1973 and peaking at 29 per cent with National Opinion Polls (NOP) on 13 October, Liberal support drifted downwards as the winter closed in and the miners’ dispute took hold.[MASK] Some Liberals feared that they would be squeezed out in a ‘crisis election’; instead, Heath’s decision to call an early poll on the question of ‘Who governs?’ played straight into the party’s hands.[MASK] The row between the Conservative government and the NUM and the resulting ‘three-day week’ powerfully dramatised the Liberal claim that adversarial politics had brought the country to a standstill, allowing Thorpe to pose as an honest broker who would ‘unite the centre’ and ‘isolate the extremists on the right and left in the national interest’.[MASK] ‘If we can offer to bring peace to Industry’, he told candidates at the beginning of the three-week campaign, ‘I believe that Liberals will gain massive support at the Polls’.[CITATION-85]","BLPES, Liberal Party papers, 9/16, fo. 13, Thorpe circular to all Liberal MPs, candidates, and national and regional party officers, n.d.

As Lessius noted, eating too much food resulted in ‘a certain kinde of dulnesse, heavinesse, and slothfull wearinesse’. The purpose of eating, so Lessius explained, was to ‘refresh the strength and powers of the bodie’, which would in turn make a person ‘more cheerfull’.[MASK] Constantly over-feeding the body corrupted digestion, which led to the creation of ill humours that stimulated negative passions. Because of the connections between the humours and passions, Lessius argued that once the humours had been contaminated by a glut of food it would be difficult to restore the body to good emotional health: ‘evil Humours do not onely excite and stirre up passions, and set them on work; but again by a certain sympathie that is between them, are themselves also set on fire, and strengthened by the passions’.[MASK] This back and forth between corrupted humours and negative passions could result in the strengthening of those passions, exacerbating the symptoms of disorders such as anger and melancholy. As Lessius explained it, an abundance of ‘cholerick humour … stirres up wrath’, then the ‘the commotion of Anger … sets on fire the spirits and the cholerick humour’, which in turn inflames choler and leads to the passion of anger being ‘increased and fortified’ to such a degree that it might turn ‘from Anger into Madnesse’.[MASK] Over-eating resulted in a vicious cycle of corrupted humours and negative passions working in tandem to disrupt body and mind. Having a more restricted diet had the opposite effect. A small amount of food produced good blood and good humours, which stimulated cheerfulness—itself crucial for good health and bodily balance.Calls for a restrictive diet were also framed by the Christian ideals of the period, ideas that were shared by Catholics like Lessius, and English Protestants. Gluttony, as one of the seven deadly sins, was believed to be detrimental not only to the health of the soul, but also the health of the body. Philip Stubbes, an English pamphleteer who was known for his puritanical attack on what he saw as the ungodly customs of the era, decried eating to excess, arguing that gluttony invariably led to idolatry. Not only that, Stubbes also claimed that eating a variety of foods in large quantities left bodies undernourished, with the food remaining undigested in the stomach like ‘dirte in a filthie sinck or pryuie’.[MASK] Christian beliefs surrounding the importance of fasting also intersected with medical ideas about the role of diet in the regulation of the passions. While gluttonous behaviour overwhelmed the stomach and the soul, fasting did the opposite. As Alec Ryrie has shown, English Protestants retained the practice of fasting in the wake of the Reformation, believing it to represent an outward sign of inner repentance. Fasting also had the power to provoke the passions. It could help stimulate appropriate levels of godly sorrow, helping an individual feel the sorrow of sin, but could also tame excessive passions that took hold in the heart.[CITATION-84]","A.

One clause of Marowe’s definition is of particular interest here:If several women or children below years of discretion assemble of themselves for their own cause, this is not a riot. But if any other person causes such persons to assemble to make such a riot, in this case it will be said to be a riot.[MASK] We might conclude that anyone in late medieval England seeking to make the case that an assembly of women was unlawful had to suggest male complicity or involvement as a matter of course—even if this did not necessarily reflect the realities of the case.[MASK] However, as we have seen, Bellamy finds no clear pronouncement to this effect before 1503.

43,1.0,Trachtenberg,Reparation in World Politics,0,"the post-war peace settlements.[MASK] The American museum curator Alfred Mansfield Brooks argued in 1918 that Germany ought to replace in kind what had been taken or destroyed from French and Belgian collections.[MASK] In 1919, Henry Guppy, the librarian of the John Rylands Library in Manchester, wrote that Germany should ‘be compelled to provide an equivalent, either in money or in kind, from their own well-stocked galleries, museums, and libraries’ for cultural objects and sites destroyed in the war.[MASK] The cultural destruction of the First World War was significant because of how it shocked and mobilised educated audiences across the world, meaning that the issue of cultural reparations—either as compensation for wartime damage or as a corollary to post-war territorial changes—became an issue with which the peace conference would have to deal.[MASK] Wartime damage accentuated a sense of grievance for states such as Belgium, France and Italy and consolidated a determination to claim reparation. The primacy of western cultural loss in wartime discourses also played a key role in shaping how treaty negotiations played out and who did—and did not—receive satisfaction for their claims.The Paris Peace Conference sat from January 1919. The question of cultural issues was not dealt with by a bespoke, expert committee but was discussed in many places, both formally and informally. The conference was a gathering of victor states, dominated by the Council of Four (the United States, Britain, France and Italy), who negotiated a settlement among themselves before presenting it to each of the vanquished states (Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary and the Ottoman Empire) to sign. In total, five treaties were signed: the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on 28 June 1919; the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye with Austria on 10 September 1919; the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine with Bulgaria on 27 November 1919; the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary on 4 June 1920; and the Treaty of Sèvres with the Ottoman Empire on 10 August 1920.Cultural objects and their restitution or replacement formed a frequent and contentious topic of discussion at the Paris Peace Conference, but the term ‘cultural property’ was not defined until the 1954 Hague Convention.[MASK] While the modern lexicon of cultural property was not available to the delegates in 1919, many of them shared a sense that cultural sites and objects ought to be categorised separately in claim-making, as well as feeling that damage to cultural sites during the war required compensation. This was heightened by the wide range of claims submitted to them by various national delegations and institutions. According to John Foster Dulles, a lawyer in the American delegation, ambiguous language was frequently used in order to enable compromise between ‘two conflicting interpretations’.[MASK] Discussions of cultural matters at the peace conference took place in commissions set up primarily to discuss other issues: namely, the Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties (CRAWEP), established to ascertain culpability for the war and breaches of law in it, and the Commission on the Reparation of Damage (CRD).[CITATION-43]","Trachtenberg, Reparation in World Politics, p. 53; Sharp, Versailles Settlement, pp. 85–6.",1

Madge’s initial artistic interest in the popular media thus fed into a wider turn towards the ‘everyday’ within inter-war sociology, subsequently forming the basis for M-O’s ‘bottom-up’ description of working-class culture. Non-voters, for example, were analysed as individuals with whole affective worlds rather than as socially aberrant. In fact, they ‘had as good a reason for not voting as the voter has for using the vote’.[MASK] Gambling, too, was praised as an important ‘outlet for personal frustration, ambition, and faith’, something which had been ‘often ignored by opponents’.[MASK] M-O’s findings were politically troubling. Although these activities were popular, they were also consumed on a more individualistic basis and undercut the traditional socialist concept of monolithic class solidarity. Madge, and Mass-Observation, perceived that ordinary life was ‘stratified into a large number of subtly graded class cultures’, formed around a complex web of associational, economic and individual relations.[MASK] To Madge, this appeared to offer a more accurate understanding of the social world. He argued that social analysis, and subsequent political action, could only ‘start from an acceptance of the real conditions of experience’.[MASK] Everyday life had to be studied from below, and without any preconceived assumptions about ‘correct’ class behaviour. This held the key to appreciating working-class experience and, ultimately, advancing social progress.M-O therefore emerged out of a wider debate within 1930s socialism. However, it made a crucial break with this milieu. It corrected the impressionistic valorisations of working-class culture which were otherwise commonplace in the Popular Front-era left. To do so, it left behind explicitly politicised writing, and instead called for a more detached form of social analysis. It argued that every aspect of ‘everyday life and everynight life’ needed to be examined in a critical, non-judgemental manner, even if this meant considering topics which might initially seem politically disconcerting to socialist intellectuals.[MASK] Mike Savage has claimed that many sociologists in this period remained guided by more patrician forms of social analysis.[MASK] Nonetheless, this left-wing, explicitly ‘modern’ social science actively sought to break down these older assumptions, and to achieve a more relativistic depiction of culture. Ultimately, however, its desire to create an ‘instrument’ which might bring about concrete social change was hampered by a lack of funding.[MASK] In fact, by the winter of 1938–39 M-O was ‘close to collapse’, with many of its researchers unpaid, hungry and profoundly disgruntled.[MASK] It was the new opportunities opened up by the extension of the wartime and post-war state that enabled a realisation of M-O’s initial aims.This moment came in the early to mid-1940s, as the course of the war turned in Britain’s favour. Across the political spectrum, thoughts turned to post-war reconstruction. Social researchers were now in demand—and Charles Madge was a notable beneficiary. He had begun investigating the ‘social factors’ involved in economic decision-making in 1938, using the ethnographic field site that M-O had established in Bolton as his base.[CITATION-44]","Ibid., pp. 113–27.",0

CRAWEP’s report concluded that among the crimes to be prosecuted was ‘wanton destruction of religious, charitable, educational, and historic buildings and monuments’.[MASK] It utilised the language of Article 27 of the 1907 Hague Convention and asserted that these breaches would be prosecuted as war crimes.[MASK] While political disagreements meant that the Leipzig trials, which sat from 1921, fell short of the aspirations of many nations, CRAWEP demonstrated that cultural damage in wartime was a significant concern of states exiting the conflict.The CRD had to determine categories of damage and estimate how losses should be compensated. The commission’s first sub-committee dealt with the issue of what war damage should be considered for reparations. In February 1919, national delegations submitted their claims. The French and British submissions both made reference to artworks in a general sense as a category of war damage. The Italian submission mentioned cultural damage in its first point and included ‘artistic patrimony’ as a category. The Serbian submission highlighted a separate section for ‘scientific and artistic education’ which specifically mentioned damage to libraries, museums, theatres and laboratories. The Czechoslovak document mentioned ‘intellectual and moral damage’, while the Belgian document had a separate category for ‘science and art’, which included universities, observatories, churches, monuments and artworks. The language of cultural damage and reparation reflected the manifold national experiences of the war and the relative value of cultural sites and practices within different nations.[MASK] In a plenary session of the reparations commission on 6 March 1919, Lord Cunliffe, a former governor of the Bank of England and one of the British representatives on the CRD, noted the difficulty of assigning value to destroyed works of art in order to arrange reparation, suggesting that they could be replaced by items of equivalent value taken from collections in the offending country—a proposal with which the French minister of finance and president of the commission, Louis-Lucien Klotz, agreed.[MASK] However, the second sub-committee decided at a meeting on 23 April that the general principle of restitution in kind would not be admitted, but the idea of repatriation of works of art would.[MASK] The CRD was generally seen as having expertise to deal with cultural issues, and specific matters were often referred to it from other parts of the conference.[MASK] The discussions at both CRAWEP and the CRD illustrated that issues of cultural reparation and repatriation would cut across all of the post-war treaties and that they were understood differently by the victims of cultural damage as well as by those adjudicating the respective claims.Cultural claims were complicated because delegations were frequently lobbied by experts or external actors with vested interests, such as learned societies or representative associations. At the beginning of March 1919, the French Académie des Beaux-Arts sent a petition to the French government which condemned the enemy’s ‘spirit of vandalism’ in wartime and suggested that French artworks held in public museums in Germany and Austria be valued and returned to France as compensation.[CITATION-55]","Journal des Débats, 2 Mar. 1919.",1

Although Louis XIV himself stepped in to defuse the dispute at its most contentious moment, the state proved unable to respond to the challenge posed to its sovereignty, with significant consequences for the French insurance industry and maritime commerce up to the end of the Old Regime.On 27 August 1688, at 16 rue Quincampoix in central Paris, a very ordinary transaction took place. Here in its offices, the Royal Insurance Company () signed a marine insurance policy with the Royal Marble Company (). Through this policy, the Royal Insurance Company agreed to reimburse the Royal Marble Company up to 16,000 livres tournois if the, or the Carrara marble with which it was loaded, was damaged or lost in the course of its voyage from Genoa to Le Havre in northern France.[MASK] When thewas seized in England at the outset of the so-called Glorious Revolution, this ordinary transaction became the subject of a most extraordinary conflict. This article analyses the conflict, piecing together evidence from the extant registers of the Royal Insurance Company, the records of Paris’s admiralty court and other archival sources in England and France.[MASK] In analysing the tentative resolution to this messy conflict, the article makes a key contribution to the study of early modern insurance. While the field has witnessed a recent renaissance, France has not yet reaped the benefits.[MASK] The article thus offers the first close study of the Royal Insurance Company in over seventy-five years, and for the first time sketches the conflict resolution system for insurance disputes in Paris after the promulgation of theof 1681.[MASK] In so doing, the article draws on, and offers empirical support for, recent analytical works on mercantile conflict resolution and management in pre-modern Europe.[MASK] This is especially valuable in the light of the paucity of sources at the historian’s disposal for studying the multi-institutional nature of early modern insurance conflicts.Nevertheless, while the article revolves around an insurance conflict, its central focus is on what this conflict reveals about royal companies in France and their function in serving state interests. The nature of the state’s intervention into the dispute sheds light on the limited life cycle of the companies, which were conceived of and treated as tools of risk management for the state in spaces where it was weak, thereby existing and functioning ‘in the absence rather than the dominance of the state’.[MASK] Here, I quote Philip Stern, who used this phrase in reference to the English East India Company, whose privileges were justified by the fact that they operated in distant lands where the state itself could not maintain a presence. Yet interests in distant lands depended upon control and mastery of the ‘wild, unruly, and untameable’ sea, which became a focal point for debates on state sovereignty throughout the early modern period.[CITATION-7]","P.

It first reveals the extent to which the French structure of authority, based on the concept of popular sovereignty, had been internalised since the formation of the Third Republic. It also confirms that mayors, elected to represent both the urban community and the state, were peripheral but none the less essential linchpins of the Republic.[MASK] Moreover, this seamstresses’ strike is all the more revealing in that their gender excluded them from formal participation in the electoral process and from the mainstream of political life. Although limited in scale and confined within the town’s boundaries, this social movement challenged their gendered exclusion and forced local elites to recognise their claims and to engage with them as political actors.As Charles Tilly demonstrated, the evolution of warfare and its growing demands for material resources and organisational reforms accounted for the formation and development of state structures in Europe. While ‘the organization of coercion and preparation for war’ constituted the state’s main objectives and functions, the raising of mass armies and the advent of industrial warfare contributed to the extension and gradual empowerment of the citizenry.[MASK] Thus, Tilly set out to explain ‘how war made states and vice versa’. He also suggested how the preparation for war and war-making affected the polity as a whole, including urban civil society within which the respective demands of the state and the citizenry were mediated. The First World War dramatically reinforced the terms of the social contract to which ‘citizenship’ refers; it also underlined the central place of negotiation, bargaining and conflict in the organisation of solidarity and in the operations of the state’s coercive apparatus.The history of the wartime state has largely and rightly focused on national administrative structures and governmental agencies.[MASK] The urban history of mobilisation supplements this perspective with an investigation into the adaptation of public services in the exceptional circumstances of the conflict. Civil society provided many of the material and human resources needed so badly by the state. From strict control to flexible partnership, circumstances dictated the attitude of the state towards civil society organisations. Circumstances, if not universal goodwill, imposed co-operation—even in France, where the prefects, the local representatives of the national government, were traditionally reluctant to cede or share any of their prerogatives with civil society. Due to the limitations of administrative bodies disorganised by military mobilisation, assistance to soldiers’ dependents and war victims was ensured by civil society organisations active in each locality.[MASK] In 1916, the French government strengthened the framework in which voluntary organisations had been operating, passing a law on 30 May 1916 to regulate the activities of ‘charities calling upon public generosity’.[MASK] Most interestingly perhaps, the necessities of war and the structure of military recruitment forced a temporary redefinition of the contours of the local state.The indisputable expansion of state agency entailed by the nature of an industrial conflict waged on a global scale is well known.[CITATION-103]","P.

Others complained that ‘the image of frivolity surrounding the Leader … contrasted with the serious nature of the campaign’, and that the party had ‘failed to promote’ the ‘grass roots campaigning image’ implied by the community politics strategy.[MASK] R.W. Johnson has characterised the period between 1974 and 1976 as the era of the UK’s ‘Great Fear’, in which ‘parts of the establishment began seriously to consider alternatives to our present form of parliamentary democracy’.[MASK] Rapid inflation—peaking around 25 per cent in 1975—and the perceived humiliation of the 1976 IMF crisis led to widespread talk of national decline and social breakdown, reinforced by a wider cultural mood which made the 1970s ‘the golden age of paranoia’.[MASK] At the most extreme end of the spectrum, figures such as the retired general Sir Walter Walker and the Cold War strategist Brian Crozier were rumoured to be flirting with the possibility of a military coup, and New Left commentators such as Stuart Hall warned that middle-class complaints about inflation, taxation and crime would provide fertile territory for ‘authoritarian populism’.[MASK] Yet talk of realignment and constitutional change also drew on more liberal and progressive sources, including the ‘Yes’ campaign in the June 1975 referendum, which brought Heath, Jenkins and Thorpe together to argue in favour of continued EEC membership. As Robert Saunders has pointed out, ‘the spirit of cross-party solidarity embodied by Britain in Europe was widely applauded’ in the press, and the referendum result was seen as a decisive victory for ‘moderates’ over the Labour left and the Powellite right.[MASK] , for instance, followed up the referendum by calling for a centrist coalition which could give effect to the shared goals of the ‘middle majority’.[MASK] The shift from election season to the normal routines of parliamentary life made it hard for the Liberals to maintain the high public profile they had gained in 1974. Although the Labour government’s slim majority of three seats gave smaller parties some leverage, the Liberals found themselves jostling with the eleven Scottish National Party MPs, three Plaid Cymru MPs, and assorted Northern Irish politicians for influence and media coverage.[MASK] Margaret Thatcher’s election as Conservative leader helped to restore Tory morale, and Thorpe’s position was under fire even before Norman Scott’s allegations broke into the public domain in January 1976.[MASK] By the time Thorpe resigned as leader in May 1976, the Liberals had fallen back to 10 per cent in the polls and were starting to experience heavy losses in local elections.Despite these setbacks, some of the themes which the Liberals had launched into public debate in 1973–4 continued to resonate. In particular, the case for electoral reform had begun to take on a life of its own before the October 1974 election, when the Oxford political scientist S.E. Finer used an article into articulate a ‘defence of deadlock’.[CITATION-135]","For a valuable overview of electoral reform debates in this period, see P.

She described how ‘so many grievous passages’ had happened to her since she was last happy, with her only comfort now being the love and joy of her family, friends and children. Dormer recognised that her natural temperament inclined towards ‘dejection’ and that this had an impact on her physical health, causing her ‘greate want of sleepe’ and ‘vapours’ around the spleen. Dormer, however, did not reconcile herself to this state of misery and ill health. In her letter, she outlined strategies she used to combat her sadness. As well as diverting her attention to the care of her ‘sweet children’, she altered her diet in a bid to raise her spirits. She told her sister how she found ‘a dish of chocolate’ to be the ‘greatest cordiall ... in the world’ for her condition.[MASK] This article explores the early modern connections between emotional health and eating to which Dormer’s consumption of chocolate alludes—connections that have thus far received scant historical analysis. Rather than just being a particular food preference, chocolate was known as a foodstuff that could stimulate feelings of joy and happiness while suppressing those of grief and sadness. Henry Stubbes, an English physician who extolled the virtues of chocolate in print, claimed that nothing freed the body of superfluous humours better. Chocolate, so Stubbes argued, ‘chears the Spirits, begets good Blood, and opens all the Emunctories of the body’.[MASK] Anne Dormer took chocolate to safeguard her emotional health, believing that it would provide her with comfort and help stir more positive passions, such as cheerfulness, while banishing her unhappiness.Dormer’s conceptualisation of chocolate as comforting is just one example of many that demonstrate that ‘comfort eating’ was a prominent feature of early modern preventative healthcare. This article examines the notion of comforting foods and practices of comfort eating in early modern England and engages with and builds on histories of the body, emotions, food and medicine. It argues for a culturally and historically specific concept of comfort eating, which differs substantially from modern definitions. While the primary function of eating was to allay hunger, comfort eating was practised to alleviate anxiety and promote happiness. Foods that were deemed comforting—that is, foods that had the ability to ease discomfort, which was characterised by feelings of sorrow, as well as, at times, by physical distress—were often distinguished by certain properties that engendered particular bodily sensations, such as satisfaction and pleasure, and helped balance other substances in the body, including the four humours.[MASK] Because of the early modern body’s material fluidity, the passions were constantly in danger of disruption, meaning people had to invest daily labour, such as practices of comfort eating, in their management.[MASK] Unlike modern definitions of comfort eating, which emphasise sentimentality and nostalgia in comfort-food selection, comfort eating in the early modern period, as this article argues, aimed to instigate a set of exchanges between the body and its material components and the passions, which were themselves experienced as highly embodied.[CITATION-5]","J.L.

Collini,"Public Moralists: Political Thought and Intellectual Life in Britain, 1850–1930",0,"look like; but it developed alongside these more familiar traditions, contributing to the diverse ideas that shaped British socialism in this period.By tracing the sociological work of unaligned left intellectuals from the 1930s to the 1950s, this article further emphasises the rich plurality of influences at play within British progressive thought in the mid-twentieth century—influences which spanned the various worlds of far-left activism, literature, art, the social sciences, town planning and parliamentary politics. Importantly, I concentrate on the work of thinkers who remained specifically unaffiliated to any political party. Their chosen role allowed them to produce analyses of ordinary culture that were strikingly flexible in their methodological approach. This therefore also helps us to reassess the genesis of the first ‘New Left’ of the late 1950s, and the birth of cultural studies in the early 1960s. In 1956 a number of Communist Party-affiliated thinkers left the CPGB, breaking with what they saw as the damaging anti-intellectualism of party orthodoxy. They instead embraced a number of interdisciplinary techniques in order to assess contemporary culture, in the hope of founding a politics more closely attuned to the experience of working-class people. Their work is often hailed as the moment when British socialism first started to examine everyday life in its full diversity, freed from the demands of political dogmatism.[MASK] In fact, left intellectuals had been engaging with the politics of everyday life in this way for at least two decades previously. Indeed, as will be shown, the nostalgic accent which New Left writers such as Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams placed on the traditional working-class community was not the sole building block of left thought across this period. It was but one facet of a more heterogeneous political tradition, of which another major animating concern was to think beyond class altogether, and to examine how culture operated at the level of the individual.From the mid-1930s onwards, a number of British left-wing intellectuals began to seek a closer appreciation of the ‘everyday’ experiences of working people. The(), a Communist Party-affiliated theoretical journal launched in 1934 and edited by Tom Wintringham, Montagu Slater, Amabel Williams-Ellis, Edgell Rickword, Randall Swingler and Alick West, became the ‘nerve centre’ of this endeavour.[MASK] Along with John Lehmann and Ralph Fox, the editors of the journalthese figures believed that a critical engagement with everyday life, through literature, social observation and art, would act as the democratic ‘bridge between Communists and fellow travellers and between social classes’ that was required to topple capitalism.[MASK] This was part of a Popular Front-inspired attempt to yoke together a broad coalition of ‘progressive’ social groupings against both the iniquities of industrial structures and, more pressingly, the threat of fascism.However, a set of much older influences was also marshalled for this urgent task. A literary language of artisanal ‘craft’—one which drew on the writings of Matthew Arnold and William Morris, and which John Burrow, Stefan Collini and Donald Winch have described as characteristic of British liberalism—was applied to the specific problems generated by modern society.[CITATION-21]","J.W.

Numerous works have demonstrated the role played by food and drink in early modern conceptions of health and disease, but surprisingly little has been said about the role of diet in the regulation of the passions and the illnesses that they were believed to generate.[MASK] This article argues that dietary management (by which I mean the intake of food and drink, rather than the more expansive early modern meaning that referred to the regulation of all the non-naturals) was critical to the health of the passions. Not only could food intake drastically alter the humoral balance of the body, and by extension the passions that an individual experienced, but foods that were considered comforting could spark the production of beneficial passions within the body, while suppressing those that were considered harmful. While Steven Shapin and Michael Schoenfeldt have made it clear in their work that a person’s emotional make-up was in part determined by their diet, they do not discuss how this impacted people’s daily experiences of food consumption.[MASK] Likewise, although scholars have increasingly analysed the centrality of diet in shaping early modern notions of identity and subjectivity, notions which were themselves highly embodied and emotionally charged, the connections between eating and the health of the passions remain poorly understood.[MASK] Some historians have begun to explore this relationship, including Erin Sullivan, who touches on the dietary causes and cures of melancholy in Renaissance England, and Ken Albala, who has considered the relationship between emotions, unbalanced humours and early modern diets, but this scholarship limits the discussion of diet and its role in governing the passions to how food impacted the four humours. Through an analysis of early modern approaches to comfort eating, this article argues that the connections between eating and the passions went far beyond a consideration of how certain foods impacted levels of the humours. How much food a person ate, and in what social contexts, was also crucial for maintaining the health of the passions.[MASK] The article places people and their everyday healthcare practices under the microscope to show the variety of dietary strategies employed by early modern individuals to regulate their passions. As a number of historians have demonstrated, early modern men and women took an active interest in their health in times of sickness and wellness.[MASK] They devised methods to prevent the onset of illness, they engaged with medical texts and other printed materials to dispense healthcare in the home, and they documented their efforts in letters and diaries.[CITATION-18]","On healthcare in the early modern home, see E.

This threatened to undermine state sovereignty in metropolitan France itself and contributed to a broader destabilisation of the conceptual divide between war and peace in pre-modern political thought and legal practice.Seen in this context, the conflict was the product of the state’s ability to manage risks through establishing business relations with close allies. Nevertheless, it emerged from, and drew unwanted attention to, both state weaknesses in the maritime sphere and the space within French commerce for a plurality of understandings of war and peace. The ambiguous resolution to the dispute had implications that fomented further conflict across France up to the end of the Old Regime.By the seventeenth century, marine insurance had already become firmly entrenched in commercial centres across Europe. The oldest known policy was issued in Genoa on 20 February 1343, transferring risks at sea to the underwriter in exchange for an agreed sum (i.e. the premium).[MASK] From the Italian states, insurance migrated across the Mediterranean and later northwards.[MASK] By the time the policy on thewas signed, Amsterdam was firmly established as Europe’s leading insurance market.

Appearing in the recipe book of Sir Thomas Osborne, the first duke of Leeds, this remedy for melancholy included an ounce of cinnamon, two nutmegs and a ‘penyworth’ of saffron.[MASK] Each of these ingredients was known to be useful in the treatment of cold diseases and, thanks to the heat that they produced, could help ‘make … a man merry’.[MASK] In other recipes, this same process of heating could be achieved by sourcing ingredients from closer to home. These ingredients may have been particularly beneficial for those who could not afford the expense of buying a variety of spices from the apothecary, or for those who lived in more rural areas where regularly sourcing foreign ingredients would have been more difficult.[MASK] While more elite households may have grown their own herbs in kitchen gardens, those from more modest families may have purchased herbs with specific medical properties from herb women.[MASK] Borage, balm and bugloss all feature prominently in recipes to tackle melancholy and were ingredients that could be bought from travelling herb women or grown at home.[MASK] Like spices from the East, these plants were characterised by herbalists as having heating properties that were particularly beneficial for the treatment of melancholy.[MASK] Most of these herbs and spices were classified as being hot in the second or third degree, meaning they could heat the body sufficiently but not excessively.[MASK] In contrast, plants that were characterised as the very hottest, in the fourth degree, had to be approached with caution. Gerard, in his description of garlic, which he classified as hot in the fourth degree, recommended boiling it first to eradicate its ‘evill juyce’. Gerard also advised that when using herbs and spices in the third or fourth degree, it was prudent to combine them with other ingredients to temper their heat. In an entry for rocket, for example, he cautioned that due to its heat it is ‘not fit nor accustomed to be eaten alone’.[MASK] For those compiling recipes for disorders such as melancholy, therefore, extensive knowledge of both domestic and foreign plants was required, as was access to these ingredients.Heat was not, however, the only quality that needed to be achieved in a successful remedy for melancholy. As we have already seen, the disease was characterised by dryness, so restoring moisture to the body was key. Generating moisture within these recipes would also be required to counteract the heating qualities of the herbs and spices described above. As noted earlier, both heat and moisture were vital to life, so ensuring that moisture was not lost through extreme heating was crucial. One of the ways that moisture could be obtained in these remedies was with the inclusion of wine or other beverages. The two most popular drinks in these recipes were sack and white wine, but medicines for melancholy also contained posset, ale and other nourishing liquids.[CITATION-125]","For recipes containing sack or white wine, see WT, MS.3009, book of Elizabeth Jacob, p. 100; MS.3724, book of Sir Thomas Osborne, p. 61; MS.3771, book of William Parnell, p. 143; and Folger, MS Add. 247, ‘A Book of Receipts’, fos. 11, 33.

Following a meeting regarding a potential loan between the Austrian finance minister, Viktor Kienböck, and the House of Morgan, the American financiers expressed their fears that the arrangement could be viewed as ‘pawn broking’.[MASK] In February 1921, Thornely Gibson of the British delegation to the Austrian Section of the Reparation Commission stated his fear that the Austrian proposals could flood an already depressed art market with tapestries. Gibson also feared that the legal ownership of the various collections was ‘a problem of extreme intricacy’.[MASK] The pledging of artworks needed to be undertaken in a manner consistent with the Treaty of Saint-Germain, but its language proved ambiguous. The interpretation of Lord Sumner’s Article 196 hinged on its definition of ‘collections’: some departments of the Austrian government took ‘collections’ to include only items that had been publicly displayed, while others took it to mean all state possessions, irrespective of whether they had been publicly displayed.[MASK] The legal service was later called upon to decide whether the Reparation Commission was entitled to arrange for art to be pledged as part of the ‘special arrangements’ that would permit collections to be dispersed within the twenty-year period stipulated by Article 196. It was determined that the commission could not do this, but that it could facilitate bilateral agreements between Austria and other states.[MASK] The prospect of tapestries being pledged against a loan elicited much negative feeling in Austria, demonstrating their perceived national importance. In December 1921, a number of learned societies in Vienna protested against the pledging of the Gobelins. They met with the Federal Chancellor, Johannes Schober, who decided that the tapestries would not leave Vienna either by sale or as security for a loan.[MASK] In February 1922, a representative of Lord Curzon wrote to the Austrian Minister in London, G. Franckenstein, committing the British government to provide a loan of £2,250,000, with certain Gobelin tapestries being pledged as security, in accordance with Article 197 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain.[CITATION-163]","LNA, C.203.1922.II, S.P.

Shapin,Was Luigi Cornaro a Dietary Expert?,0,"and herbalists recommended avoiding to keep choler, and the associated passion of anger, at bay included salt, leeks, mint, thick wine and heating spices.[MASK] As with the dietary advice on melancholy, foods with the opposite humoral characteristics were recommended for those who were vulnerable to elevated levels of choler. Ingredients that were considered temperamentally moist, such asand violets, and those that had cooling properties, such as barberries and cherries, helped keep choler at safe levels and the passion of anger unstirred.[MASK] Elyot recommended that those who ‘abounded’ in choler should follow a strict dietary programme of cooling and moistening the body by eating ‘meates, whiche be cold in a moderate quantite’, diluting ‘their wyne more or lasse with water’ and ‘eschewynge hotte spices, hotte wines, and excessiue labour’.[MASK] The role played by diet in regulating emotional health, however, went beyond a consideration of how certain foods might elevate levels of particular humours. To keep the passions well governed, a long-term dietary strategy was required. Comfort eating was not a temporary practice, only employed at moments of emotional weakness to restore humoral balance, but rather was part and parcel of everyday approaches to food intake. In a compiled and translated text from 1634 entitled, avoiding unwanted passions, such as anger, was linked to broader lifestyle decisions in which a person’s daily diet was critically important. Each of the authors included within the compendium advocated a sparse or ‘sober’ diet to their readers, arguing that sobriety in eating ‘is the soveraigne means and instrument for preservation of bodily health and vigoar of minde in and unto long old age’.[MASK] Temperance in eating would inevitably lead to temperance in the body. A temperate body, free from corrupted or excessive humours, was the key, so these authors argued, to a vigorous mind and well-ordered passions. As Leonardus Lessius, the principal author of the, succinctly put it, ‘the conditions of the Minde follow the temper of the Bodie’.[MASK] Lessius argued that over-eating caused ‘superfluous excrements’ and evil vapours that were transmitted from the stomach to the head. These corrupted vapours, as we have seen, could infect the entire bodily system, agitating the various spirits that coursed through the body and provoking unwanted and troublesome passions around the heart. Lessius explained to his readers that ‘benigne juice’ ‘causeth benigne affections’, while ‘malignant juices’ ‘causeth fierceness and wildnesse in the affections’.[MASK] By overwhelming the stomach with too much food (Lessius advised only eating 12–14 ounces of food a day), regardless of the individual elemental make-up of specific foodstuffs, early modern people ran the risk of ruining the process of concoction, and this in turn could result in the creation of corrupted humours, spirits and undesirable passions.Lessius’s publication did not only mete out advice. Within the text, a case-study was provided that demonstrated the value of a sober diet and the extraordinary health results it could produce. One tract included in the publication was, written by Luigi Cornaro, a Venetian landowner who was well known for his longevity.[CITATION-72]","A.

Although Josselin was not convinced that diligently measuring the amount of food eaten on a daily basis was necessary, he nonetheless concurred with Lessius and Cornaro that a ‘full diet is not best’ as ‘plus necat gula quam gladius’ (‘gluttony kills more than the sword’). Moreover, Josselin considered a ‘slender and a hard diett’ to be particularly conducive to his own health and he resolved to be ‘more moderate’ in his diet in the future.[MASK] Josselin does not give us an indication of whether he managed to incorporate Lessius’s advice successfully into his own diet, but his diary, along with other letters and journals from the seventeenth century, suggests that restricting food intake was not the only way to spark cheerfulness through dietary choices. Cornaro noted that the general belief was that ‘that which savours, is good and nourisheth’.[MASK] In other words, to stay healthy in body and mind, a person should eat foods that they enjoyed as they were likely to provide more nourishment. Lessius himself confessed that his ideas were not shared by all. As he begrudgingly admitted, it was generally accepted that it was ‘a great part of unhappinesse to be limited in a mans diet’.[MASK] Not only did many people consider a full and tasty diet to be good for health, they also believed that restricting your diet and not eating the foods you enjoyed could actually lead to the production of negative passions such as unhappiness. The senses, including that of taste, were indelibly linked to the creation of the passions. Wright noted that the senses were ‘joint friends’ with the passions and ‘whatsoever delighted sense, pleased the passions’.[MASK] An object, such as a particular food, would transfer its qualities to the senses (in this case, the taste buds) which would then transport this data via the spirits to the brain. This sensory information was then calibrated by the imagination, which would create an impression of the external object, in this case a specific food, to which the sensitive soul would respond with the creation of passions.[MASK] If, for example, a particular food tasted pleasurable, this sensory experience would stimulate positive passions, while if a food elicited disgust from the taste buds, a negative impression and negative passions would be created. How a food tasted thus helped individuals assess the potential impact it might have on the passions.While some, such as Josselin, could see the benefits of a spare diet, others sought comfort and pleasure through food, eating and recommending that others eat foods that brought them joy and cheerfulness.[MASK] In particular, the gifting of food and acts of commensality were considered excellent ways of promoting the health of the passions. Eating together and exchanging gifts of food not only established and strengthened social bonds and promoted ideals of Christian community and altruism, but were also practices that had significant medical implications.[CITATION-93]","For the social and religious dimensions of gifting foods and commensality, see n. 20 above.",1

Keith Middlemas has characterised 1972–4 as the last and boldest attempt to reverse the UK’s relative economic decline through corporatist co-operation: ‘a strategic attempt to rethink the nature of … the postwar settlement’ which was undermined by bitter rows over the government’s Industrial Relations Act, housing finance reforms and regressive tax policies.[MASK] The OPEC oil embargo and Heath’s confrontation with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) brought matters to a head in the winter of 1973–4; indeed, the economist Michael Stewart thought this period ‘saw the opening up of class divides and the emergence of social antagonisms on a scale probably not witnessed since the General Strike half a century before’.[MASK] Heath’s unpopularity and perceived divisiveness created new opportunities for the Liberals. If the role of the state in a modern economy was to hold the ring between capital and labour, as Heath’s rhetoric increasingly suggested, then the Liberals could reasonably question whether either Labour or the Conservatives were sufficiently independent to define and represent the national interest.[MASK] At the same time, the party’s efforts to reassert its relevance were also aided by the divisions which had opened up in the Labour Party in 1971–2, when Roy Jenkins and sixty-eight other MPs defied a three-line whip to vote in favour of entry to the European Economic Community (EEC). Thorpe contrasted the Liberals’ consistent support for Europe with Harold Wilson’s equivocations on the issue, and floated the prospect of drawing Jenkinsites and moderate Tories into a ‘coalition of the centre’.[MASK] thought that the idea of the Liberals as ‘the nucleus of a powerful, moderate party’ was a chimera, but William Rees-Mogg ofwas more receptive to the idea, and commissioned a poll in September 1972 which suggested that 35 per cent of voters would support an alliance between the Liberals and Labour moderates.[MASK] (Perhaps more strikingly, 53 per cent agreed that ‘The present party political system no longer works properly’, and 40 per cent supported the proposition that ‘If there was a chance of the Liberal Party getting into power, I would vote for them’.) Though Jenkins and his supporters rebuffed the idea, discussions of realignment were kept alive by Dick Taverne’s resignation as a Labour MP after a row with left-wing activists in Lincoln, and his triumphant victory as a ‘Democratic Labour’ candidate in the resulting March 1973 by-election.[CITATION-51]","J.

The restoration of the manuscript collections of Louvain addressed the most infamous instance of cultural destruction in the war and was uncontroversial, but its example was not widely replicated elsewhere; the issues provoked by the settlement in Central and Eastern Europe proved much more complex and rested, in many cases, upon competing visions of national identity and their compatibility with the logic of reparations.While the question of dealing with Germany exercised the Allied delegates most at the peace conference, the treaty with Austria had the most complicated and controversial cultural issues to resolve. The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy opened up questions of the ownership of cultural items which had either originated in the Habsburg Empire or had been acquired by the Habsburgs from the late eighteenth century onwards. Many of these items were on display in museums, meaning that the issues at stake centred on the question of states displaying cultural objects that had originated elsewhere. The possession of cultural objects and their display in national museums was a means through which states could articulate both their national identity and their civilisational progress. Early twentieth-century Vienna was seen as one of Europe’s great cities where, in the words of the contemporary satirist Karl Kraus, the streets were ‘paved with culture’.[MASK] The issues raised at the peace conference had the potential to form a precedent for the restitution of objects to their country of origin. In this way, they anticipated twenty-first-century debates about cultural restitution between metropoles and former extra-European colonies, but with the distinction that these debates were an intra-European affair.At a meeting of the second sub-commission of the CRD on 21 February 1919, the Italian representative Mariano d’Amelio stated that the Italian government had compiled a list of artworks for which it would seek restitution from Austria. These included both works taken in the recently ended war and those which had not been restored since the Italian reclamation of Lombardy from the Habsburg Empire in 1859 and the Veneto in 1866. A number of Italian claims focused on items which had been removed from Venice to Vienna while under Habsburg rule.[CITATION-76]","New York Times Magazine, 13 Apr. 1919.",1

Recognising that this was a contentious issue, Villain and Hazon exercised their right to appoint a third arbiter to help them to judge the case. They chose Pierre Chabert, the consul to the French nation in Amsterdam, who had been forced to return to Paris after the outbreak of war. The three arbiters convened the parties at Chabert’s house on the afternoon of Thursday 6 October 1689 to hear the arguments and deliver their judgment.The record of this extraordinary dispute is kept in the Royal Insurance Company’s arbitration register. This register does not spell out the arguments presented by each party; instead, it lists the documents that were submitted to the arbiters for consideration: in keeping a record of these, the arbiters made sure that nothing was lost, ensuring that paperwork could be returned to the parties for later legal actions. Fortunately, we can sketch out the outlines of some of the arguments that were made by piecing this evidence together. As part of their supporting evidence, the Royal Insurance Company’s directors submitted to the arbiters ‘articles 28, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42’ of the sectionand ‘articles 24 and 26’ of the sectionof the.[MASK] With these articles as their legal foundations, the directors argued that the Royal Insurance Company was not liable for the loss of theon two grounds.Firstly, the directors submitted that the Royal Marble Company ‘paid the [augmented] premium in case of war only after it had known of the loss of their ship and cargo’, absolving the Royal Insurance Company of all responsibility for payment.[MASK] This was built on articles 38 to 41 of. Article 38 declared ‘null’ all insurance ‘made after the loss or arrival of the insured effects, if the insured knew or could have known of the loss, or the insurer of the arrival, before the signing of the policy’.[MASK] The potential to hold this knowledge was determined through the presumptions of articles 39 and 40: ‘the insured will be presumed to have known of the loss, and the insurer the arrival of the insured effects, if it is found that, from the place of loss or the approach of the vessel, the news had been able to be carried [i.e. transmitted] before the signing of the policy to the place where it was concluded, in counting one and a half [nautical] leagues per hour, without prejudice to other proofs’.[CITATION-66]","Ibid., p. 94.

The very same day, the partners petitioned Paris’s admiralty court to judge the dispute. It agreed to do so, with proceedings noted on 27 May and 6 June that produced no clear result. On 20 June, the Royal Insurance Company submitted its choice of Claude Villain as arbiter to the court and asked that, in express conformity with theand the Royal Insurance Company’s letters patent, the Royal Marble Company be compelled to follow suit and settle the dispute through arbitration instead of through the court.[MASK] Apparently, the court did not agree to this. Instead, it passed judgment on the case before it between 20 and 26 June.[MASK] Not simply finding in favour of the Royal Marble Company, the court submitted the directors of the Royal Insurance Company tothat is, they were sentenced to be imprisoned until the debt was paid in full. This was the ultimate violation of the Royal Insurance Company’s letters patent, which held that the directors would never be held personally liable for the Royal Insurance Company’s debts. The company was an explicitly unlimited liability institution, meaning that all its shareholders were liable for any losses (in proportion to their investment) once its funds were depleted, but directors were expressly accorded no further responsibility for any debts in their capacity as directors.[MASK] Ron Harris has recently argued that shareholder liability was not expressly delineated by corporations before the period 1780–1830 because the circumstances did not exist for this to be necessary.[MASK] Yet shareholder liability was at the heart of the Royal Insurance Company’s creation and its functioning: for Seignelay, a clear demarcation of shareholder liability was essential in ensuring the creditworthiness of the institution. Through such a demarcation, policyholders-as-creditors were assured indemnification even if the company itself became insolvent.[MASK] This affront to the directors’ rights was especially egregious, as, following the most literal interpretation of the phrase ‘personally liable’, it was not their effects that were being seized here, but their own bodies.

Indeed, he closely resembles some of Jack Hilton’s protean heroes. Naughton’s protagonist is a lorry boy, whose roving lifestyle closely models the ‘outlaw’ existences described by Hilton. His travels around the country, chatting, drinking, and womanising, exude a heroic masculinity. He ‘seldom applies himself to the job’, preferring to ‘behave crude and tough with girls’, usually with a ‘successful’ outcome. He appears ‘mentally quicker than most young men’, using this dexterity to elude recriminations from reproachful bosses and vengeful, cuckolded husbands.[MASK] Naughton used first-hand testimony, rendered in a scattergun South London argot, to highlight his character’s incessant energy.Naughton and Madge might have seemed to be valuing a type of working-class ingenuity that did not differ greatly from that of Hilton’s early 1930s writings. However, this working-class ebullience was now expressed through novel means. Whereas Hilton’s heroes had been drenched in the sweat of working-class toil, Naughton’s spiv was far more likely to be doused in a liberal sprinkling of the latest French cologne.[MASK] He was a ‘big city product’, far slicker and more savvy than the grimy figures from the industrial North who had filled the output of the worker-writers of the 1930s. The spiv’s individuality was expressed through the creative way by which he consumed commercial products. He out-dazzled his dowdy-looking colleagues by ‘never owning fewer than four good quality suits’. He confounded the uptight middle-class clients he encountered on his travels by ‘always’ turning up to work in one, combined with suede shoes, a gleaming white collar, and the obligatory ‘flashy jewellery’. He wore these nominally middle-class products in a defiantly working-class way, carrying them off with a ‘whole little cocky attitude’.[MASK] In Naughton’s account, it is the spiv himself who provides the most accurate summary of his cultural make-up. He forcefully states that ‘there’s nothing worse than a bloke who tries wearing a fancy cut of clothes but hasn’t got the touch off’.[MASK] Buying and possessing clothes and jewellery had become a means of expressing one’s personality. Ordinary people now had an even more democratic tool to stage their identities, through mass capitalism. Madge believed that working people should be given adequate material opportunities to bolster these inventive cultures. The state needed to use top-level planning to remove economic and social barriers to consumption. This would fully allow people to meet and interact together within society, finding democratic ‘common ground’—just as Madge and the workers had while ‘Drinking in Bolton’ almost a decade earlier.[CITATION-108]","Madge, ‘Drinking in Bolton’, p. 108.",1

Madge used oral testimony to illustrate how ordinary families had complied with household budget constraints, but had reframed them within existing patterns of working-class life. This problematised the vision of class struggle articulated by earlier left-wing figures.had framed itself as the intellectual vanguard needed to lead ordinary people in their inevitable struggle against the capitalist state. But Madge now believed working-class cultures were powerful and creative enough to organise themselves. He argued for a society structured so that the idiosyncratic patterns of social life which he had explored in the regions could be reproduced on a national basis.Michael Young was another left-wing sociologist who benefited from these new opportunities. Before the war Young had initially worked as a solicitor at McKenna and Company, before taking an Economics degree at the LSE, where he attended additional classes in political science, commercial law, and social and economic history.[MASK] At the same time, he also remained active in the world of London grass-roots socialism. There were strong links in the 1930s between the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA), the Labour Party, and local left-wing community projects, with which M-O itself had been involved.[MASK] Young was involved in these endeavours while at the LSE, through his activism with the Communist Party, and as a member of the WEA.[MASK] Young was particularly interested in exploring how the vibrancy of working-class culture might be encouraged. The war effort gave him an ideal opportunity to think this through, as community-based projects such as the WEA were co-opted into the expanded civil defence and military apparatus.[MASK] He founded the state-funded Industrial Discussion Clubs Experiment in 1943, along witheditor Amabel Williams-Ellis and the Marxist art historian Alan Jarvis. These were essentially WEA discussion sessions replicated in a factory setting. As Jarvis later explained, their groups attempted to provide safe spaces where ‘the real contemporary problems of real people’ might come to the fore.[MASK] In 1939 Young secured a position as a researcher for Political and Economic Planning, the think-tank founded in 1931 by Max Nicholson. He began to study how the new institutions of the wartime state interacted with pre-existing patterns of working-class life, while ‘carrying out all sorts of welfare work’ in Blitz-era London.[MASK] His findings were presented in a PEP research pamphlet published in 1941 on the management of the wartime social services. Far from destroying them, Young found that the London County Council’s shelter policies had bolstered working-class initiatives. In Bermondsey, co-operation between ‘the local authority, the ARP organisations, voluntary bodies and representatives of the shelter population’ had produced a flourishing sense of community.[CITATION-56]","CCA, YUNG 2/2/1, ‘Social Services in the Blitz’, 1941.",1

In the Belgian case this related to the destruction of the library at Louvain in 1914, whereas for France restitution went back to the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. The cultural articles of the Treaty of Versailles demonstrated the primacy to be accorded to the specific cultural claims of the main Allied nations in Western Europe; the same standard was not equally applied in the treaties of Saint-Germain, Trianon or Neuilly. Versailles also underscored the central position that Germany occupied among vanquished states.Three articles dealing with cultural reparations were inserted into the Treaty of Versailles; 245, 246 and 247.[MASK] Article 247 specifically called for reparation for the destruction of the university library of Louvain, a key point in international cultural mobilisation at the beginning of the war. Despite the centrality of Louvain to debates about cultural destruction, it was a late addition to the treaty and did not emanate from the CRD. The Belgian government tabled the proposal at the end of April 1919 directly to Clemenceau, with the drafting committee adding it to the treaty at the start of May 1919.[MASK] In his letter to Clemenceau, the Belgian foreign minister Paul Hymans cited the Hague conventions and claimed that although the damage done to Louvain could not be compensated for in monetary terms, Germany ought to make an ‘equitable compensation’.[MASK] Article 247 committed Germany to furnish ‘the University of Louvain [with] manuscripts, incunabula, printed books, maps and objects of collection corresponding in number and value to those destroyed in the burning by Germany of the Library of Louvain’. It also named two works of art to be returned to Belgium. These were the triptych of the Mystic Lamb by the Van Eyck brothers and the triptych of the Last Supper by Dieric Bouts, both of which had been acquired legitimately by German museums.[MASK] This provision constituted a form of restitution in kind for damage to Belgian property in the war and in so doing went against the resolutions of the Reparation Commission against restitution in kind of only a few weeks prior.[MASK] Lord Sumner, a judge and British representative on the CRD, wrote with some frustration that ‘the Reparation Commission had nothing to do with the clauses in the German Treaty’, by which he meant articles 246 and 247.[MASK] While the CRD sought to apply some consistency of approach, decisions regarding specific articles were sometimes taken by the Council of Four for political reasons.The example of Article 247 was not widely repeated in the other treaties and this reflects the elevated status that Belgium held at the peace conference as the ‘first victim’ of Germany in 1914. Belgium had been singled out in Wilson’s Fourteen Points as deserving full ‘restoration’ and, at the peace conference, the Belgian delegation pressured the peacemakers to ensure that they received special treatment.[CITATION-64]","Burnett, Reparation at the Paris Peace Conference, I, pp. 126–7.",1

In practice, self-determination remained a vague idea which was applied in a limited and inconsistent manner and only in Europe.[MASK] The vagueness of self-determination meant that arguments for and decisions regarding the precise borders of new or expanded states were made for a wide variety of (sometimes contradictory) reasons, including geographical characteristics, linguistic make-up, economics, and ethnicity, as well as political expediency.[MASK] Leonard V. Smith has shown how petitioners to the peace conference frequently emphasised history as ‘the decisive discourse’, with former imperial rulers taking on the role of oppressors in these narratives.[MASK] Calls for the restitution of cultural objects—which far outnumbered those which actually appeared in the final treaties—were based on tangible evidence of historic cultural development and membership of the ‘civilised world’, and became part of the diplomatic vocabulary utilised by states to underpin their claims to statehood or its expansion. As will be shown, claims to cultural objects in the name of nation states presented most problems where they affected so-called ‘centres of civilisation’ in deposed empires whose museums and galleries contained collections drawn from around Europe and the wider world. British and American diplomats often empathised with the plight of these museums and their collections.Secondly, calls for the restitution of cultural objects contribute to our understanding of reparations at the Paris Peace Conference. Reparations have attracted much scholarly attention, but most works on the topic focus on economics, such as the amount of reparation payments charged to Germany and its ability to meet these requirements in the 1920s.[MASK] It was at the Commission on the Reparation of Damage that restitution of cultural objects was discussed, and it was through the institution of the post-war Inter-Allied Reparation Commission that the return of items was effected. Cultural objects took on a special value, providing moral compensation for what were perceived to be some of the worst excesses of total warfare, namely, the destruction of cultural sites such as Louvain University library in Belgium.[CITATION-14]","J.

The broad geographical spread of Liberal support, however, meant that the party won only fourteen seats: holding three of the five by-election gains, retaking Colne Valley and Bodmin (which had been lost in 1970), and adding the Isle of Wight, Hazel Grove, and Cardigan. Data from the British Election Study (BES) suggests that almost half of the new Liberal voters had not voted in 1970, and that the rest were drawn fairly evenly from Labour and the Conservatives; however, some of the Labour-to-Liberal switchers may have been tactically motivated, since most of the Liberals’ strongest performances (including more than four-fifths of their 146 second places) came in Tory constituencies.[MASK] In particular, the Liberals established themselves as the main challengers to the Conservatives across a broad swathe of southern England, coming second in sixty-eight out of 105 Tory-held seats south of the Thames, and made particularly big strides in London suburbs and commuter seats such as Richmond, Twickenham, and Guildford.[MASK] By contrast, the Liberal results bore little relationship to local government activity, perhaps because the dark February nights were not well suited to pavement politics. Indeed, Liverpool Wavertree—where the incoming council leader Cyril Carr was the Liberal candidate—was one of only two English seats where the Liberal vote share went down.[MASK] Who were the six million Liberal voters? Analysis of the BES and other opinion surveys suggests four main patterns. Firstly, Liberal voters were disproportionately young: for instance, the BES found that 27 per cent of under-25s and 23 per cent of 25- to 34- year-olds supported the Liberals, falling to 10 per cent among those aged 75 and over.[MASK] The Conservative Party’s private polling of 16–28 year olds also highlighted ‘[t]he disruptive effect of the Liberals on the political loyalties of the young’, and suggested that young women and those with ‘more and higher educational qualifications than the age group as a whole’ were particularly likely to switch to Thorpe’s party.[MASK] Secondly, as in the 1960s, the Liberals did better among the ‘salariat’ and other white-collar groups than among manual workers.[CITATION-97]","For instance, the BES found that the Liberals won 23 per cent support among the ‘professional and managerial classes’ and ‘intermediate and routine non-manual workers’, but only 15 per cent among the ‘manual working class’: ibid., p. 19.",1
9,1.0,S. Rees-Jones,Public and Private Space and Gender in Medieval Europe,0,"presence away or relegate their complaints to ‘women’s issues’. By contrast, when men are involved, modern commentators decide that they speak for a ‘common good’, and devote considerable interpretative energies to deciphering what has spurred them into action, seeing—for instance—a wealth of meaning in protests about poverty, inequality or evil counsel. The operative logic is that women can speak only for themselves, men for others. Here we consider the documentary evidence for women’s participation in protest, and show that women were not necessarily driven by gendered motives. Defining their part is as challenging as defining that of male rebels.The King was on his way to hold his hunt in the Northern countries … He changed his mind, turned around, and came back … Some say that it is because for three or four days after he started on the journey, he was urged insistently by the people on the road to recall the Queen, and the women cried strangely after the Lady, calling out a thousand insults and rebukes ().[MASK] It is July 1532. ‘The Lady’ here, Anne Boleyn, was not yet Henry VIII’s wife; he was still married to Catherine of Aragon. The couple’s progress northwards was hampered by the disapproval of ‘the people’. In this letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, the ambassador Eustace Chapuys remarked particularly upon the vocal role of women in stopping the royal party in its tracks. Modern scholars, in so far as they have noticed this episode, have interpreted it as demonstrating womanly interest in the ‘matrimonial affairs of the royal family’.[MASK] No one has thought to include the 1532 halting of the royal hunt in histories of political protest in Tudor England. The omission epitomises the systemic oversight of female dissent in late medieval and early Tudor England. Accounting for this omission, and starting to re-imagine what a properly constituted history of protest would look like, are the primary goals of this essay.[MASK] Popular politics in the fifteenth century, particularly the latter half, is in general an understudied area.[MASK] Yet one of the distinctive features of the later fourteenth to mid-sixteenth centuries is the recurrence of mass popular insurrections expressing collective grievance. On two occasions, 1450 and 1497, rebels (or petitioners) marched on London.[MASK] Women were demonstrably among them. Even so, most scholarly accounts up to the 1980s, and often beyond, portray revolt as a wholly male enterprise. If and when the subject of female participation is broached, it is concluded that women were little involved in public acts of dissent in England.[MASK] For example, Samuel Cohn found that ‘women, far from being the principal participants in later medieval protest, were remarkable for their absence’.[MASK] Where historians do find women at the centre of civil unrest, they explain their presence away.[MASK] The protestors, so the thinking goes, must have been interested in ‘women’s issues’: they were angry on behalf of deserted wives, such as Catherine. Their quarrel with the royal household pertained to the ‘private sphere’, without wider political significance.[CITATION-9]","S.

111,1.0,Jackson,Equality and the British Left,0,"individuality was expressed through the creative way by which he consumed commercial products. He out-dazzled his dowdy-looking colleagues by ‘never owning fewer than four good quality suits’. He confounded the uptight middle-class clients he encountered on his travels by ‘always’ turning up to work in one, combined with suede shoes, a gleaming white collar, and the obligatory ‘flashy jewellery’. He wore these nominally middle-class products in a defiantly working-class way, carrying them off with a ‘whole little cocky attitude’.[MASK] In Naughton’s account, it is the spiv himself who provides the most accurate summary of his cultural make-up. He forcefully states that ‘there’s nothing worse than a bloke who tries wearing a fancy cut of clothes but hasn’t got the touch off’.[MASK] Buying and possessing clothes and jewellery had become a means of expressing one’s personality. Ordinary people now had an even more democratic tool to stage their identities, through mass capitalism. Madge believed that working people should be given adequate material opportunities to bolster these inventive cultures. The state needed to use top-level planning to remove economic and social barriers to consumption. This would fully allow people to meet and interact together within society, finding democratic ‘common ground’—just as Madge and the workers had while ‘Drinking in Bolton’ almost a decade earlier.[MASK] Many contemporary left-wing analysts, however, viewed affluence with trepidation. Lawrence Black and Stuart Middleton have charted the ambivalence with which both leading Labour Party figures and the rank-and-file viewed working-class consumption.[MASK] Similarly, Richard Hornsey has argued that the ‘bourgeois morality’ of post-war planners was troubled by the ‘ineffable fluidity’ of figures with liminal class or sexual identities. In this way, Naughton’s character of the spiv, and his ‘exaltation’ of ‘frivolity and fashion’, clashed with social democracy’s faith in planned ‘progress and stability’.[MASK] But Madge, and the writers he cultivated at, attempted to reconcile irreverence and acquisitiveness with egalitarianism. In so doing, Madge was prefiguring the work of the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, and the rich portrayals of working-class cultural life that it produced from the 1960s onwards. As Madge showed, ordinary people enjoyed indulging in a wide variety of leisure activities, many of which were based around the material culture of capitalist society. This did not mean they were suffering from false consciousness; instead, rising incomes served to reinforce the ingenuity of working-class expression.These different sociological responses to post-war reconstruction chimed with a number of strands of Labour Party thought. Ben Jackson has argued that we should move away from characterising the Labour Party in the 1940s and 1950s as divided by what he believes to be the ‘overrated’ economic argument between left-wing ‘Bevanites’ (the proponents of wholesale nationalisation) and right-wing ‘Gaitskellite’ revisionists (the advocates of Keynesian demand management). Instead, he has suggested that the most significant division in this period was between those thinkers who conceived of socialism solely as the ‘egalitarian distribution of material goods’, and those who believed it should also comprise the ‘older ambition’ of encouraging more ‘co-operative and fraternal social attitudes’.[CITATION-111]","Jackson, Equality and the British Left , pp. 140, 162.

In fact, they ‘had as good a reason for not voting as the voter has for using the vote’.[MASK] Gambling, too, was praised as an important ‘outlet for personal frustration, ambition, and faith’, something which had been ‘often ignored by opponents’.[MASK] M-O’s findings were politically troubling. Although these activities were popular, they were also consumed on a more individualistic basis and undercut the traditional socialist concept of monolithic class solidarity. Madge, and Mass-Observation, perceived that ordinary life was ‘stratified into a large number of subtly graded class cultures’, formed around a complex web of associational, economic and individual relations.[MASK] To Madge, this appeared to offer a more accurate understanding of the social world. He argued that social analysis, and subsequent political action, could only ‘start from an acceptance of the real conditions of experience’.[MASK] Everyday life had to be studied from below, and without any preconceived assumptions about ‘correct’ class behaviour. This held the key to appreciating working-class experience and, ultimately, advancing social progress.M-O therefore emerged out of a wider debate within 1930s socialism. However, it made a crucial break with this milieu. It corrected the impressionistic valorisations of working-class culture which were otherwise commonplace in the Popular Front-era left. To do so, it left behind explicitly politicised writing, and instead called for a more detached form of social analysis. It argued that every aspect of ‘everyday life and everynight life’ needed to be examined in a critical, non-judgemental manner, even if this meant considering topics which might initially seem politically disconcerting to socialist intellectuals.[MASK] Mike Savage has claimed that many sociologists in this period remained guided by more patrician forms of social analysis.[MASK] Nonetheless, this left-wing, explicitly ‘modern’ social science actively sought to break down these older assumptions, and to achieve a more relativistic depiction of culture. Ultimately, however, its desire to create an ‘instrument’ which might bring about concrete social change was hampered by a lack of funding.[MASK] In fact, by the winter of 1938–39 M-O was ‘close to collapse’, with many of its researchers unpaid, hungry and profoundly disgruntled.[MASK] It was the new opportunities opened up by the extension of the wartime and post-war state that enabled a realisation of M-O’s initial aims.This moment came in the early to mid-1940s, as the course of the war turned in Britain’s favour. Across the political spectrum, thoughts turned to post-war reconstruction. Social researchers were now in demand—and Charles Madge was a notable beneficiary. He had begun investigating the ‘social factors’ involved in economic decision-making in 1938, using the ethnographic field site that M-O had established in Bolton as his base.[MASK] Although he left M-O in 1940, he continued his project, working at what he called the ‘fruitful borderland between economics and social research’,[MASK] and his study fed into an investigation of regional spending patterns sponsored by J.M. Keynes and the National Council for Social and Economic Research (NCSER).[MASK] This resulted in a series of articles published in thefrom 1940 to 1941.[CITATION-47]","C.

Both humours were characterised by dryness, so maintaining moisture within the body was essential for ensuring that melancholy could not take hold. According to Elyot the most ‘convenient’ foods to eat to avoid melancholy were those that ‘be temperate in heate, but specially they that be moyst’.[MASK] The crusts of bread, which were deemed ‘verie drie’, could engender melancholy, as could other overly dry foods such as coleworts and cabbages—these had ‘a drying and binding facultie’ that engendered a ‘grosse and Melancholicke blood’.[MASK] As well as avoiding dry foods, readers of health regimens were also advised to incorporate certain foods into their diets to prevent the onset of melancholy. Cogan recommended that those who were predisposed to melancholy, such as the elderly, who had naturally drier and colder bodies, should drink wine moderately as it ‘maketh them merry and represseth melancholinesse’.[MASK] Melancholy was not the only illness of the passions that could be avoided through careful management of diet. The passion of anger, if excessive, was believed to be particularly harmful.[MASK] According to the puritan theologian John Downame, anger was the result of ‘heating of the bloud about the hart’ and should be avoided at all costs.[MASK] Anger could be precipitated by a number of things, including jealousy, pride and inordinate desire, and could lead to trembling limbs, reddening of the face and gnashing of teeth.[MASK] Anger, if not moderated and properly controlled, was also thought to lead to a loss of reason which in turn could result in a descent into madness.[MASK] Given its alarming consequences, advice about how to avoid anger was widespread in moralistic and medical texts. Downame noted in his discussion of anger that ‘wise Physitions thinke it the better & safer course to preserve health and prevent sicknesse, then to remove the disease after it hath taken possession of the body’.[MASK] As with most medical advice in the early modern period, then, prevention was believed to be better than a cure.As with melancholy, there were a variety of means by which anger could be avoided but diet was once again a key consideration. Those of a choleric constitution were more prone to bouts of anger, as their bodies were already overly hot and dry.[MASK] Anything that increased body heat beyond normal levels could result in the production of heat around the heart and the passion of anger. Similarly, for those unaccustomed to hot, dry foods, eating an abundance of foods that could increase levels of choler in the body could also leave them vulnerable to the disease of anger. Foods that had the potential to increase choler included onions, garlic, honey, pepper and mustard.[MASK] These foods were believed to be particularly heating and drying and thus matched the elemental qualities of the hot, dry humour choler. Describing garlic, the herbalist John Gerard noted that it is ‘very sharpe, hot, and dry’, warning that those ‘of a hot complexion must especially abstaine from it’.[CITATION-65]","Gerard, Herball, pp. 177–8.",1
85,1.0,ADH,3 R 28,0,"Here again, the cultural dynamic of mobilisation stemmed from the transformations of warfare, for the totalising logic of the conflict also led to the emergence of specific sets of norms associated with wartime social life. In this context, the mobilisation of the urban home front prompted the emergence of new divisions and new categories within the citizenry of belligerent societies whose respective positions were evoked in terms of duty and defined by the wartime ‘social relations of sacrifice’.[MASK] Accordingly, the front-line soldier stood out as the main character and role model in a wartime narrative which defined ideal civilian comportment in terms of duty, sacrifice and solidarity. The demands of industrial warfare were such that the material comforts of the home front populations were expected to become a casualty of the war. Material deprivations indeed soon added to military losses to foster a growing sense of victimisation on the home front. The dialectical articulation of victimisation and participation thus structured the perception and behaviour patterns which ultimately determined the levels and forms of social mobilisation. There are few better ways to approach the tensions inherent in patriotic mobilisation than to consider how southern communities responded to the influx of refugees from the north and eastern regions of the country.[MASK] The experience of those who had fled the combat zones to seek refuge in Béziers sheds light on the moral underpinnings of wartime patriotism.Up to the beginning of 1915, refugees symbolised a wider war culture and their fate represented the barbarism of German warfare.[MASK] They were at this time considered as heroic victims of German militarism and were treated as such; supporting refugees was therefore elevated to a prime patriotic duty by national authorities and civil society alike.[MASK] Yet, from 1915 onwards, tensions surfaced and incidents broke out between Belgian refugees and their hosts across the country. ‘Boches du Nord’, ‘Dirty Belgians’, ‘German’ and other terms of abuse were hurled at the exiles who unsurprisingly resented them and urged their representatives to demand that they be treated more respectfully.[MASK] Likewise, refugees from Alsace-Lorraine and the northern regions of France suffered defamation from their southern fellow citizens, who mistook them for German-speakers and hurled at them the infamous abuse: ‘Boche’. Evidence garnered from postal censorship bore out the recurrence of such incidents, asserting that the ‘gap between the North and the South () seemed to grow wider’.[MASK] Reinforced by deep and reciprocal ignorance as well as linguistic or legal marks of otherness, the refugees were no longer granted much sympathy or any special status among war victims. When every family was now facing grief and mourning, refugees found themselves accused of enjoying safety, of idleness, and of grim opportunism. Local populations no longer ascribed to them any dignifying quality. As far from the front as the people of Béziers and the south might have been, they, too, saw themselves as victims of the war. Increasingly insensitive to the particular plight of refugees, they demanded from them total participation in the war effort.[CITATION-85]","ADH, 3 R 28.",1

This ‘small restless group’—as one of their own number later called them—used their talk about elections to assert a profoundly tutelary understanding of politics.[MASK] This valorised their shared claim to authority—as they talked and wrote, they cast the people of Uganda as holders of sovereign authority, yet also as subjects in need of education. Voters, they argued, did not fully understand the consequences of their choices. Vulnerable to political opportunists, the electorate required instruction.At the same time, the media reportage revealed both self-fashioning and a project of mutual discipline by that group of literate English-speakers. Uganda had a considerable press in other languages—notably Luganda, spoken in Uganda’s economic and governmental centre, the former southern kingdom of Buganda, where there had been a lively and enthusiastically political press since the early colonial period.[MASK] By the mid-1960s newspapers and radio were, as one observer noted, ‘a necessity for the educated elite and influentials’, and English-language media carried a particular weight—despite their modest circulation.[MASK] The colonial language was in effect the national language and was entangled with ‘nation-building’: prosperity was the promised reward for overcoming ethnic division, and English was seen as the tool for that overcoming.[MASK] Luganda, meanwhile, was inevitably associated with the persistent force of Buganda political exceptionalism (on which, more below).[MASK] Law gave legal force to the linkage of national politics and English: candidates for parliament had to prove their proficiency in English.[MASK] The colonial language conjured an audience that was international, as well as national: writing in English, Uganda’s intellectuals could see themselves as part of debates that were continental and global in scale.English was a language of estrangement as well as power. Public political events routinely involved performances of a linguistic hierarchy of difference: national politicians addressed local crowds in English, pausing for translators to render their message into vernacular languages. The Ugandan poet Okot p’Bitek (writing in English) described post-independence African politics as ‘government by the educated, for the educated. You cannot become a member of their parliament unless you speak English or French’.[MASK] Vernacular press journalists complained that Uganda’s elite were only interested in the English-language media.[MASK] Those who used the colonial language were constantly aware that their very claims to status might rob them of legitimacy: they feared to be seen as members of a lucky elite who—as another poet, Taban lo Liyong, bitingly put it—had ‘fallen into things’ and lost touch with the people.[CITATION-23]","Taban lo Liyong, The Song of Lawino (1966; Oxford, 1984), p. 110.",1

Robert,"Capital Cities at War: Paris, London, Berlin, 1914–1919",0,"first, that they were the ultimate and exclusive arbiters of patriotism; secondly, that patriotism and nationalism were synonymous; and thirdly, that patriotism was first demonstrated in wartime by the unquestioning acceptance of the authority of the state apparatus and of the armed forces in particular.By contrast, this article rejects the misleading confusions between nationalism and patriotism and between theand patriotic mobilisation. It sets out to study popular patriotism in its own terms and contends that urban history offers a productive way to situate patriotic mobilisation in the local and national contexts in which it took place. Indeed, this article argues that wartime patriotism ought to be considered as part of a larger reflection on the political and cultural geography of France in the era of the Great War. Historians of the First World War long assumed that the process of nationalisation of the French polity had reached its apex in August 1914. In recent years, however, a string of works on France and Germany have demonstrated that nation-making and processes of centralisation had not entailed the withering of local identities.[MASK] The urban history of wartime mobilisation offers a fruitful way to study the articulation of national and infra-national identities and to rescue patriotism from the idealistic and exclusionary definition that nationalists sought to impose upon their contemporaries and historians alike. Moreover, this article suggests that a decentred approach to national mobilisation, focusing on peripheral and, in this case, southern regions of France, may shed critical light on the nature and process of national mobilisation.The distinctions between nationalism and patriotism, between theand patriotic mobilisation are not simply of relevance to continuing historiographical debate. In present-day commemorative contexts, they are also critical if historians are to challenge successfully the growing assertion of regionalist and essentialist definitions of social identities that threaten to undermine public understanding of the conflict. It is indeed striking to see how the centenary of the war and the flurry of activities, events and publications it generated, reactivated conventional as well as regional narratives of victimisation. These also built on and appropriated the kind of rhetoric deployed by those activists and intellectuals who have rightly been calling for France to reckon with the crimes and moral legacies of its imperialist ventures.[MASK] Like those who legitimately agitate for the integration of colonial soldiers into the national memory of the war, regionalist writers have evoked soldiers of Languedoc, Corsica, Brittany or the Basque country as sacrificial victims of the French centralising and nationalising project.[MASK] In this regard, France is just another example of a multicultural society grappling with the memory of wars fought in the name of the nation-state. Yet, historians of the Breton or southern experiences of the war also lend credence to such regionalist interpretations when they appear to endorse theas an ideal-type of national mobilisation.[MASK] This article draws on a rich scholarly field in which historians of the urban experience of the war have, over the last two decades, framed their contributions in both local and comparative terms.[CITATION-25]","R.

In August 1686, he broke this contract to sign another with a new royal company that was based on rue Thévenot in Paris.[MASK] The partners were Jean Haudicquer de Blancourt, who was involved in the general farm in the posts of Guyenne and Toulouse; Claude Accault, a royal counsellor () and also a tax farmer; Claude Delaistre, a royal counsellor and secretary; Simon de Montgrand, a royal counsellor; and Dominique de Montgrand, sieur de Mazade, a nobleman based in Marseille.[MASK] While Montgrand de Mazade did not sign the original contract, he was soon granted power of attorney by the Royal Marble Company to co-ordinate its activities in Italy and was later acknowledged as a partner.[MASK] Therefore, just like Seignelay, Louvois opted to give the contract to a group ofand Crown allies upon whom he could depend to fulfil state needs while also serving their own interests through currying royal favour.[MASK] This company, like its predecessor, was tasked with providing Carrara marble to the court. As its name suggests, Carrara marble was sourced in and around the city of Carrara in north-western Italy. It was prized across the world for being of the highest quality, used even in the construction of the Taj Mahal.[MASK] This made it ideal for crafting statues for the French court, where mediocre marble from the Pyrenees was inadequate in expressing the glory and magnificence of the Sun King.[MASK] Nevertheless, the transport of marble from Carrara to France was a true logistical challenge, and the Royal Marble Company was supported in this undertaking by naval officials () and the consuls of the French nation in Genoa and Livorno.[MASK] With their support, theset sail from Genoa loaded with thirty-seven blocks () of marble, purchased for 8,755 livres.[MASK] If the voyage had gone to plan, thewould have arrived in Le Havre, at the mouth of the Seine, where the marble would have been loaded ontosmall vessels used to load and unload large ships—to be carried upstream to Rouen, and then loaded again onto river boats to be carried towards Paris. Following the terms of the contract, payment for this marble would have come only after its safe arrival, with three quarters paid when the marble arrived in Le Havre and the remaining quarter upon arrival in Paris.[CITATION-35]","Bresc-Bautier, ‘L’importation du marbre de Carrare’.",0

Firstly, a succession of Conservative MPs—mostly moderates such as Maurice Macmillan and Ian Gilmour—publicly expressed an interest in a coalition, whereas Labour ministers vigorously rejected it.[MASK] The Liberals pointed out that Heath’s confrontational record in office meant that he could hardly pose as a unifying figure, but that implied that they might be willing to serve under a different Tory leader.[MASK] Secondly, as Jo Grimond pointed out, any coalition would need a clear ‘goal’, since the country would ‘not be pulled out of its decline simply by cobbling together a Cabinet of different parties’.[MASK] The obvious rationale for co-operation was to deal with the economic crisis created by the oil shock, which by mid-1974 had produced rapid inflation and a large balance-of-payments deficit.[MASK] Thorpe thus used a speech at Loughborough in July to set out a ‘minimum programme required to save this country from economic disaster’, involving prices and incomes controls, electoral reform, industrial co-partnership, and cuts in ‘prestige projects’ in order to redirect resources to social security.[MASK] Yet thoughwas impressed by the ‘Left-wing flavour’ of his speech, many of the Liberals’ most attractive social policies had already been pre-empted by the minority Labour government.[MASK] To many on the left, a GNU seemed to be little more than a vehicle to manoeuvre Labour out of office, re-impose wage restraint, and smuggle in proportional representation by the back door.Suspicions that the Liberals were tacking to the centre right were reinforced by a hardening of the party’s economic stance after the February election. John Pardoe, for instance, warned in lurid terms that Britain was ‘approaching that situation of “explosive inflation” which has been experienced in so many South American countries’, which would be ‘a danger to our society, to our politics, to our Parliamentary Institutions, to our very democracy’. Though he rejected monetarism on the grounds that mass unemployment was unacceptable, he argued that ‘the menace of inflation must be met; met hard; and met now’, and accused the Labour Chancellor, Denis Healey, of attempting to evade the problem.[MASK] Faced with an interventionist Labour government and corporate alarm about a ‘profits squeeze’, some Liberal MPs also began to worry about the survival of the market economy. Pardoe declared that Labour’s attempt to hold down prices through controls and subsidies was ‘nuts’, while Wainwright warned that ‘Export-led growth cannot be achieved by State-shackled manufacturing industry’.[MASK] Even Thorpe claimed that Britain had become ‘a nation living beyond its means, with a standard of living which cannot be sustained by our current level of economic activity’. Sooner or later, the Liberal leader insisted, the government would have to be honest with the electorate about the need for sacrifice.[CITATION-115]","BLPES, Liberal Party papers, 9/14, fos 141–3, speech by Thorpe at Loughborough, 5 July 1974, at fo. 141.

It also highlights the ethical dimensions of the process of patriotic mobilisation and finally underlines the specificities of urban wartime politics.The intensity of the historiographical dispute over the French war effort in 1914–18 has obscured the fact that protagonists on both sides of the argument paradoxically share what one may call—for lack of a better term—a ‘consensualist’ view of wartime mobilisation. Indeed, the idea that wartime mobilisation stemmed from theand from a rather improbable national consensus remains surprisingly prevalent across the divide drawn by the controversy. For Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker and many others, national mobilisation was the effect and product of a patriotic consensus crystallised by war violence into a specific ‘war culture’.[MASK] For Rémy Cazals, Frédéric Rousseau, Nicolas Offenstadt and André Loez, strikes and mutinies demonstrate that national mobilisation was only made possible and maintained by the exercise of state coercion and propaganda.[MASK] Though they draw opposite conclusions from the French war experience, both interpretations therefore seem to share the same premise; namely that only national consensus could underpin wartime national mobilisation. Both sides in this debate also inadvertently conspire to neglect patriotism as a category of political analysis. On the one hand, proponents of the ‘war culture’ paradigm rightly stress the symbolic and emotional dimensions of ‘national sentiment’.[MASK] Yet, in doing so, they tend to detach nationhood from the social and political contexts in which it was tested. Drawing on anthropology, literary scholarship and art history, they also rarely mobilise the categories of political history, which were key to the works of an earlier generation represented by Jean-Jacques Becker and Antoine Prost.[MASK] Meanwhile, the protagonists on the other side of the argument have long seemed reluctant to evoke patriotism, for fear perhaps of finding evidence of it.[MASK] In any case, they appear unwilling or unable to reconcile the existence of social or regional tensions with the possibility of commitment to national defence.[MASK] Surprisingly in this context, French historians of the First World War have rarely engaged with historical and social scientific approaches to nationalism and nationhood in a sustained and critical fashion.[MASK] They have indeed often conflated nationalism, nationhood and patriotism. Nicolas Mariot’s recent study of the frontline encounter between intellectuals and working-class soldiers illustrates the perils of such confusion. Mariot sets out to challenge the idea that the experience of combat had welded estranged social groups into a frontline community. To do so, he relies on the testimonies of combatant intellectuals to argue that the resilience of working-class and rural soldiers cannot be taken as evidence of patriotism. Mariot underlines the incapacity of rank-and-file participants to express their commitment to national defence in the idealistic terms favoured by intellectuals and nationalists. This, in his view, demonstrates the irrelevance of patriotism as an interpretative factor.[MASK] Frédéric Rousseau also addresses this question. As in Mariot’s study, the conviction that state coercion accounted for the tenacity of French soldiers underpins his central argument.[CITATION-17]","Mariot, Tous unis dans la tranchée?, pp. 11, 24, 272, 291, 366; F.

Three days earlier, Thorpe’s attempt to appeal to late-summer holidaymakers had descended into farce when his hovercraft ran aground on Sidmouth beach, but at Brighton he offered a sober warning about Britain’s mounting economic difficulties.[MASK] His flamboyant style, he explained to ainterviewer, was designed to draw attention to a ‘deadly serious’ message: ‘we are living beyond our means, the Government is borrowing more than it could ever hope to repay, our debts are accumulating to the tune of £4,500 million annually and there is no single panacea which can rescue us’.[MASK] If the coming October election produced another hung Parliament, the Liberals would seek to form a Government of National Unity in order to ‘save the country from the perils of bankruptcy, poverty and unemployment’. Unless the UK’s democratic leaders took ‘a grip on its affairs’, Thorpe warned, then ‘less discerning individuals’ would ‘have no scruples about using more painful instruments of repression’ to tackle the nation’s problems.[MASK] The 1970s is widely remembered as a turning point in post-war British history: a period when inflation and trade union militancy led to a crisis of confidence in the post-war settlement and helped open the door for Margaret Thatcher’s election victory in 1979. Political narratives of the decade have tended to be structured around a series of failures of governance—the 1973–4 energy crisis, the 1976 International Monetary Fund (IMF) application, and the 1978–9 ‘Winter of Discontent’—from which the Thatcher government’s monetarist experiment offered a divisive but politically successful way out.[MASK] As historians such as Lawrence Black and Hugh Pemberton have pointed out, however, the prevailing view of the 1970s as a ‘benighted decade’ is itself a politically constructed one, which risks obscuring more complex patterns of social and cultural change and foreclosing the possibility of different outcomes.[MASK] On the one hand, electoral dealignment and fears of ‘the break-up of Britain’ can be seen as symptoms of a larger cultural shift in which class-based identities and established social institutions were disrupted by the decline of ‘deference’ and the rise of ‘popular individualism’.[MASK] On the other hand, we also need to pay close attention to the complex temporalities of the decade and the political contingencies involved in the coming of Thatcherism.Recent accounts of the construction of ‘crisis’ in 1970s Britain have largely focused on Conservative politicians and their supporters in the press—as, for instance, in Camilla Schofield’s study of Enoch Powell, Robert Saunders’s work on Margaret Thatcher, and Colin Hay’s influential analysis of the ‘Winter of Discontent’.[MASK] As Jim Tomlinson has noted, however, ‘declinism’ was by no means confined to the political right, but ‘became the common currency of British politics in the 1970s’.[MASK] As Conservative and Labour governments struggled to respond to the UK’s economic challenges, Liberals, Marxist radicals, and Scottish and Welsh nationalists all gained political traction and played an important role in fostering a sense of political dislocation.[CITATION-9]","On the revival of Scottish nationalism in the 1970s, see especially B.

36,1.0,,,0,"these women could not have gathered without ‘the mayntenaunce, supportacione, and abeytyng of their husbandes and other misruled persons’.[MASK] However, that is not what we see at Cumberland in 1470: women are shown to have been married, but their husbands did not also feel the need to seek a pardon for participation or complicity. Further, the appearance of women separately from their male kin may reflect how they applied for a pardon: perhaps these women sought amnesty independently. Evidently, they did not consider their role to be inherently linked to that of men.The large-scale nature of Jack Cade’s rebellion in 1450, as well as the large volume of pardons, makes this set of records particularly useful. In his treatment of Cade’s Rebellion, Bertram Wolffe provided a detailed analysis of the social composition of the individuals named on the pardon rolls, but through a lens of maleness and occupation. Having counted 3,327 names, he noted with surprise the presence of eighteen esquires, as well as a single knight and seventy-six gentlemen. The ninety-five named women, whom Wolffe did not acknowledge or analyse, presumably for him could be categorised under the ‘many without designation’, along with the ungendered ‘others’ of townships—though surely the presence of an abbess is at least as notable as that of his ‘impeccably respectable’ mayors and former sheriffs.[MASK] The abbess in question was Katherine of St Mary’s, Barking, sister of William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk. Suffolk was widely reviled for his role in the loss of French territories, and had been executed after a mock trial earlier in 1450. The recipients of general pardons were of course ‘no mere list of rebels’.[MASK] Such pardons provided a comprehensive amnesty, free of charge, and would have been widely regarded as useful even if an individual had nothing to do with the rebellion.[MASK] Receipt of a pardon may also have been a protective measure against false or malicious accusation.[MASK] Isobel Harvey sees this as the impetus behind Katherine de la Pole’s pardon of 1450.[MASK] She asserts that Katherine was likely to have been on the roll as a means of defence against potential ‘anti-Suffolk backlash’ in the wake of the rebellion. The same reasoning is applied by Harvey to Katherine’s (male) tenants who appear on the roll, four from Barking and at least another four from unspecified locations within the Becontree hundred.[MASK] These men may indeed have feared repercussions from their association with the de la Pole name. A macaronic satirical dirge on the death of the duke, reported to have been written by the commons of Kent and appearing in several manuscripts, depicts Katherine as performing the Office of the Dead at his funeral alongside unpopular councillors, churchmen, and the recently murdered bishop of Chichester, Adam Moleyns: ‘The Abbes of Seynt Alborghe [shall say],’.[MASK] This phrase comes from the opening of Psalm 7, which continues ‘save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces’.[CITATION-36]","Psalm 7:2, The Authorized King James Version.",1

Schumacher. Since the world’s resources were ‘limited’ and the UK would need to transition to ‘an age of stability’ with ‘controlled economic growth’, it was all the more important to limit ‘private consumption by the few in favour of better public services for the majority of our citizens’.[MASK] Secondly, the Liberals promised to transform the relationship between workers and employers by making radical changes to corporate structure. Under the label of ‘co-partnership’, the party proposed to create Works Councils in firms with more than twenty employees, to require firms with more than fifty employees to introduce profit-sharing schemes, and to give employees half the votes (alongside shareholders) in the election of ‘supervisory boards’. These proposals drew on a longer history of Liberal thinking about partnership which dated back at least as far as David Lloyd George’s ‘Yellow Book’ on(1928) and had been fleshed out in the 1960s by Peter McGregor, a manager at the engineering firm Ferranti. During 1973, Liberal MPs introduced private members’ bills on the subject in an attempt to capture public attention, and Thorpe claimed that co-partnership would create ‘a totally new climate in industry’, which would help to solve the UK’s economic problems.[MASK] As Stuart White has pointed out, the Liberals’ plans implied a sharp break with the traditional conception of the capitalist firm, placing significant constraints on managerial autonomy and the pursuit of shareholder value. At the same time, they also attempted to empower workers as individuals, in contrast to the Labour left’s trade union-orientated vision of industrial democracy.[MASK] Thirdly, the Liberals reframed their long-standing commitment to constitutional reform as a response to the new political moment. Proportional representation (PR) remained the party’s main demand, but Thorpe and his colleagues now justified it not only on grounds of fairness but also as a way of restoring the effectiveness and legitimacy of the UK political system. Electoral reform would end the abrupt swings of the pendulum which had destabilised British economic policy since 1964 and encourage a more consensual and ‘European’ style of government. In line with the principles of community politics, the Liberals also called for a radical devolution of power from Westminster and Whitehall: first to elected parliaments or assemblies in Scotland, Wales, and the English regions, then to local authorities, and finally to neighbourhood councils, which—unlike the districts created by the 1972 Local Government Act—would be small enough to allow for meaningful participation.[CITATION-69]","BLPES, Liberal Party papers, 9/16, fos 43–4, general election bulletin no. 15, 26 Feb. 1974; Liberal Party, Power to the People (London, 1974).",0

The mutineers improvised a billet in the heart of the town, where they were photographed, holding the butts of their rifles aloft, surrounded by townsmen and women. This remains, to this day, one of the most enduring images conjured up by the name of Béziers. The mutiny of the soldiers of the 17th went on to gain iconic status in the French pacifist tradition, thanks to a song composed soon after the events by Montéhus.[MASK] These soldiers, recruited and stationed in the local area, had come to embody the unreliable nature of the southern regions, whose local identity was deemed to threaten the integrity of the French nation-state. The challenge they so dramatically issued to the military authorities underlines the problematic nature of the relationship between the expression of peripheral and national identities in France at the turn of the twentieth century. When the First World War broke out, however, Béziers and its surrounding district () responded unreservedly to the call to arms. In this particular context, the indisputable success of national mobilisation calls into question conventional interpretations of the processes of the creation of the nation. It also invites us to rethink our understanding of patriotism and to place wartime mobilisation in the broader context of social mobilisation and contention in the early twentieth century.Béziers, known as the ‘wine capital’, stood at the heart of a region entirely dedicated to wine-growing and was a major centre of the national and European wine markets.[MASK] A few indicators illustrate the extent to which the economic destiny of the town was inseparable from the success of the local intoxicant. In 1914, the department of the Hérault, where Béziers is located, accounted for more than a quarter of the national wine production (27.9 per cent). In theof Béziers, vines covered 77.7 per cent of the land and generated 90.4 per cent of local revenue. 67.5 per cent of the municipality’s area was devoted to wine-growing.[CITATION-31]","J.

Yet this is not what we see: wives with and without their husbands make up a far greater proportion of the women who appear in pardon rolls. The most interesting thing is that they are there at all, given that we are mostly led by standard accounts of revolts to believe that they should not be.Even where there is evidence for women as active figures and ringleaders motivated by ideas of the common good, they go unrecognised by otherwise comprehensive modern historical accounts. This may in part be due to the often ungendered groups that appear in more accessible records, such as letters of commission in the printed patent rolls. Occasionally, chronicle narratives provide evidence of women’s involvement where it is lacking in commission letters. On 7 January 1401, a commission of oyer and terminer was sent to Bristol ‘to enquire about all treasons, insurrections, rebellions, conventicles and unlawful congregations’ relating to a refusal by the city to pay tax still owing from Richard II’s reign.[MASK] As with so many commissions, there is no indicator of the demography of the crowd. Yet Adam Usk, writing contemporaneously, records:On 1 May, in the middle of the market place at Norton St Philip, the drapers killed some of the King’s servants who had arrived bearing royal letters and demanding from them a tax … At Bristol, the wives undertook this task on behalf of their husbands, exchanging blows with another group of tax-collectors during a similar skirmish.[MASK] This is no exaggeration on the part of the chronicler: the indictments also indicate a majority female crowd comprised of the wives of drapers and merchants.[MASK] In his discussion of this case, the Victorian scholar James Wylie described the collectors as being ‘driven off, the women taking part in the fighting’.[MASK] The passive ‘driven off’ here implies the presence of another, male, group. The crowd thus becomes male by default, rendering the women a mildly diverting side-detail. This is replicated in Chris Given-Wilson’s relation of the same episode, where the riot is called the act of ‘citizens of Bristol’, and their gender relegated to a footnote.[MASK] A lack of gender indication should not be read as meaning ‘men’: we cannot simply assume either that a crowd was normally male, or that female crowds were considered exceptional.[MASK] We simply do not know how often neutral abstractions mask female, or indeed male, participation.An example from Henbury, Gloucestershire, is revealing. A predominantly female crowd of around 120 people besieged Robert Pers in 1525 when he attempted to enter two messuages and a half yardland he had bought for an exceptionally low fine of 300. Fourteen women were indicted for riot and other misdemeanours before the Gloucestershire justices of the peace. Of these, five were subsequently mentioned by Pers in his bill of complaint to Star Chamber, two alongside their husbands.[CITATION-44]","TNA, STAC 2/21/136, 2/26/138.",1

Yet the French historiography of the Great War has for the best part of four decades ascribed them a prominent role in the discussion of front-line experience. This is, in no small part, due to the impact of the memoirs of Louis Barthas, a barrel maker and socialist activist from the Aude, whose remarkable testimony was published in 1978 on the initiative of the historian Rémy Cazals.[MASK] The first in a long and still growing series of diaries and memoirs written by ‘ordinary’ soldiers, Barthas’s recollections captured the imagination of a large readership. In vivid and often cynical prose, Barthas tells a war story that resonated with many veterans and their descendants. Recalling the misery and horrors of industrial warfare, Barthas recounted trench life from the point of view of the common soldiers and NCOs. Castigating French commanders for their murderous incompetence, Barthas denounced the war as well as the empty rhetoric of nationalism. A fascinating and gripping text, his memoirs rejected any notion of patriotic mobilisation and exemplify a Socialist and pacifist vision of the war. Born in a village some forty kilometres west of Béziers, Barthas served in the 296th Infantry Regiment, the reserve of the town’s 96th. It is therefore useful to place his testimony alongside that of other local soldiers, such as that of Georges Crassous.A wine-grower from theof Béziers, Crassous had, like Barthas, benefited from little formal education beyond primary school. An anti-clerical and Socialist activist, Crassous had been involved in a series of wine-growers’ strikes in the years leading up to his military service in 1913. Crassous first saw combat on the Western Front in the 61st Infantry Regiment, part of the much-maligned 15th Army Corps. After fighting at Verdun and the Somme, he was transferred to the Armée d’Orient in January 1917 and contributed to military operations in Greece and Serbia. He returned to France in July 1918 and served there until his demobilisation in the summer of 1919.Crassous’s unpublished diaries never shy away from the horrors of war and recount, at times in graphic detail, his encounter with industrial warfare. As critical of his commanders as most other, he resented any infringement of the equality among combatants. In September 1917, he wrote to the Socialistof Béziers to protest the implementation of furlough policies, underlining the paradoxical persistence, in a war for ‘Right and Justice’, of inequalities in the treatment of soldiers.[MASK] In his first wartime letter, written to his parents on 1 August 1914—‘a fateful time, an anxious time, a criminal moment’—Crassous harboured no illusion about a war which would bring about ‘the most awful atrocities, the cruellest sufferings’. Yet he went on to express his hope that it might ‘bring about eternal Peace and the welfare of humankind’. Crassous here echoed the majority of French Socialists who had resigned themselves to war, in the hope that the defeat of German militarism would consolidate and spread social democracy across Europe.[CITATION-66]","Ibid., letter, 1 Aug. 1914; S.

This debate regarding the future direction of social democracy had longer, more substantive roots than is generally appreciated, which stretched back to the intellectual developments of the 1930s and 1940s.Nonetheless, many of the former M-O researchers were frustrated by the limited scope for reconstruction which Labour politics afforded, and by their experience of formal political office more generally. Madge was appointed Social Development Officer of Stevenage New Town in 1947. He later recalled the ‘frustration’ he felt when he was told there was only sufficient money for 75 staff members, rather than the 5,000 he claimed that he had been promised.[MASK] Madge felt that he had acquired a sophisticated understanding of ‘what pre-war legislators used to call the “working classes”’, and how they lived and interacted together.[MASK] But his experiences in Stevenage highlighted the large gap between his dreams and Treasury reality; a disjuncture which Madge could not help but ‘find more sad than funny’.[MASK] Moreover, there remained the possibility that working-class people simply did not want to be planned for. The last page of Madge’s(1943) had summed up these tensions.[MASK] The text is one of a number of ‘plans’ Madge published in the mid-1940s. He struggled to sketch out a post-war framework which could match strong economic growth with cultural diversity. The book is filled with prescriptions for reorganising industry along fairer and more efficient lines, and yet the very viability of these plans is knowingly questioned by Madge’s choice of the cover inset photograph. A workman peacefully snoozes on his building site. He seems unmoved by the busy schemes for reconstruction which fill the pages of the book. Emphasising this point, a copy of J.C. Smuts’ssits apparently unread on his chest.[MASK] The message is clear: the diverse and determinedly independent hopes and dreams of ordinary people, which formed the focus of Madge’s sociological analysis, had to be accounted for in public policy-making. But this same independence forcefully contested the idea that the working classes either wanted or needed their habits to be ‘planned’ into existence.By the later 1940s, however, fears of the suffocating impact of planning seemed to be becoming a reality. In 1947, Michael Young warily noted the ‘disillusionment of many formerly enthusiastic supporters of the Labour Party’. He was worried that ‘right-wing authoritarian elements’ would marshal the middle class behind some kind of extra-parliamentary, quasi-Fascist movement.[MASK] Leo Kuper’s 1953 study of ninety households in Coventry, to which Madge provided the foreword, found that many inhabitants hated the ‘blueprint for living together’ which post-war planners had attempted to impose on them.[MASK] These findings highlighted the unparalleled political and social polarisation which marked the period.[MASK] The Conservatives launched a strongly partisan campaign against the Labour Party’s ‘post-war settlement’, attacking its supposed profligacy, bureaucracy, and authoritarianism. Large elements of the middle class turned against the government, rejecting its redistributive policies as favouring the ‘special interests’ of its working-class constituents.[CITATION-126]","H.

3,1.0,,,0,"Women appear in our sources as active participants in outbreaks of revolt across the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. This should not be surprising, yet historians’ general silence on the subject makes it so. Most scholarly accounts up to the 1980s, and often beyond, portray revolt as a wholly male enterprise. If and when the subject of female participation is broached, it is concluded that women were little involved in public acts of dissent in England. Where historians do find women at the centre of civil unrest, they explain their presence away or relegate their complaints to ‘women’s issues’. By contrast, when men are involved, modern commentators decide that they speak for a ‘common good’, and devote considerable interpretative energies to deciphering what has spurred them into action, seeing—for instance—a wealth of meaning in protests about poverty, inequality or evil counsel. The operative logic is that women can speak only for themselves, men for others. Here we consider the documentary evidence for women’s participation in protest, and show that women were not necessarily driven by gendered motives. Defining their part is as challenging as defining that of male rebels.The King was on his way to hold his hunt in the Northern countries … He changed his mind, turned around, and came back … Some say that it is because for three or four days after he started on the journey, he was urged insistently by the people on the road to recall the Queen, and the women cried strangely after the Lady, calling out a thousand insults and rebukes ().[MASK] It is July 1532. ‘The Lady’ here, Anne Boleyn, was not yet Henry VIII’s wife; he was still married to Catherine of Aragon. The couple’s progress northwards was hampered by the disapproval of ‘the people’. In this letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, the ambassador Eustace Chapuys remarked particularly upon the vocal role of women in stopping the royal party in its tracks. Modern scholars, in so far as they have noticed this episode, have interpreted it as demonstrating womanly interest in the ‘matrimonial affairs of the royal family’.[MASK] No one has thought to include the 1532 halting of the royal hunt in histories of political protest in Tudor England. The omission epitomises the systemic oversight of female dissent in late medieval and early Tudor England. Accounting for this omission, and starting to re-imagine what a properly constituted history of protest would look like, are the primary goals of this essay.[CITATION-3]","My source selection holds few surprises: King’s Bench indictments, pardon rolls, and manor court records constitute the main documentary record of popular insurrection; alongside these, there are contemporary and near-contemporary narratives in chronicles and letters. I have used these selectively, with the aim of raising questions and problems of interpretation, rather than presenting a complete survey.",0

He began to study how the new institutions of the wartime state interacted with pre-existing patterns of working-class life, while ‘carrying out all sorts of welfare work’ in Blitz-era London.[MASK] His findings were presented in a PEP research pamphlet published in 1941 on the management of the wartime social services. Far from destroying them, Young found that the London County Council’s shelter policies had bolstered working-class initiatives. In Bermondsey, co-operation between ‘the local authority, the ARP organisations, voluntary bodies and representatives of the shelter population’ had produced a flourishing sense of community.[MASK] The council had distributed books and allocated more spaces for civic use. The community in turn used these to organise adult education classes, lead collective reading and wireless groups, and encourage workshops in painting and creative writing. State policy therefore did not ‘replace’ working-class culture, and could instead ‘provide new and richer opportunities’ for its development.[MASK] Moreover, it cut across the barriers imposed by socio-economic class. New community schemes helped to foster ‘unexpected sources of social leadership’, with working-class residents leading their middle-class neighbours in communal activities.[MASK] If properly planned, Young concluded, state policy could be used to allow every individual to have a fair stake in society.The wartime state provided socialist intellectuals with the opportunity to study everyday life at closer hand. Two different strands of thought arose from this. Madge believed that the ingenious working-class cultures he had valorised as acritic, and had carefully charted as an M-O and NCSER-sponsored sociologist, were entirely autonomous. They functioned at a family, and even an individual, level. The state therefore needed to use top-level planning to remove economic inequality, while allowing the free play of working-class individuality to proliferate from the bottom up. Young argued for close, micro-level linkages between local authorities and existing systems of working-class mutualism, in order to bolster an organic communal politics. As he later argued, it was in the kinship group of extended family, and ‘amongst friends at work, in the pub’ that ordinary people were most themselves; in short, were most individual.[MASK] The state should nurture these resistant spaces within everyday life, using them as the foundation stones on which to construct a true democracy. Madge thus believed that ‘civic experience’ was constructed out of private habits and customs, expressed at an individual level.[MASK] In contrast, Young argued that people were only most free to express these private desires when in a group, encouraged by the presence of like-minded ‘fellows’.[MASK] Nonetheless, both agreed that the overriding aim of socialism was to free individuals to behave in diverse ways, even if this contravened certain normative assumptions held by socialist leaders. This had been the driving dynamic of their political careers, ever since the earliest debates at the. A number of historians have suggested that the wartime projects of social reconstruction mobilised the intelligentsia in some way.[CITATION-62]","Although they differ on how well received these ideas were, these accounts all assume an intellectual ‘turning-point’ in the late 1930s or early 1940s: P.

In both cases, Trullet was named as the shipmaster.[MASK] From this, they argued that the company itself had endorsed Trullet as a competent shipmaster through their own underwriting.[MASK] In any case, it was easy to argue that Trullet had acted appropriately, docking in Dartmouth only out of necessity and in total ignorance of what had transpired in Devon only days earlier. Given that the last major land invasion of England from the Continent had taken place 622 years earlier, Trullet could scarcely have been expected to foresee William of Orange’s landing. Moreover, he could not have been expected to know about Louis XIV’s declaration of war against the Dutch, since this came on the same day as the’s arrival into Dartmouth. Even if the weather had allowed theto leave Dartmouth on 27 November, Trullet’s capture by Dutch soldiers the same day had prevented this from happening. Put simply, the argument about Trullet’s negligence had no legs.After reflecting on the arguments of both parties, the arbiters delivered their judgment. The Royal Insurance Company was ordered to make payment of 16,000 livres (the full amount insured) as well as interest on this starting from 14 April 1689 and expenses of 24 livres.[MASK] In return, the Royal Insurance Company was granted full rights to the vessel and merchandise abandoned to them. Sadly, the reasons for the arbiters’ decision are not given: it can only be presumed that they deemed the activation of the war clause not to be analogous to a new policy and considered the argument for Trullet’s negligence unconvincing.With the conclusion of the case, Accault asked Jagault to transcribe the Royal Insurance Company’s record of the case in full so that it could be submitted to the admiralty court. Jagault duly obliged, and on 13 October—a week after the case had concluded—Accault, Delaistre, Montgrand and Montgrand de Mazade submitted the transcription to the court for the judgment to be ratified.[MASK] But the Royal Insurance Company was not finished: while the court ratified the judgment on 17 October, on 15 October they had received the company’s directors, who signalled their intention to appeal the decision through the company’s privileged appeals process, in which royal councillors and Paris’s leading municipal figures would serve as the judges rather than theof Paris (see).[MASK] The Royal Insurance Company’s procedure for resolving insurance conflicts, following its letters patent of 1686.In the end, this appeal never took place.

August 1982,0,"though the prospect of a renewed consensus was an attractive one, the Liberals’ strategy for shoring up Keynesian welfare capitalism was not without its limitations. In particular, Pardoe’s economic policy relied heavily on the belief that a package of redistribution, workers’ participation, and constitutional reform could make statutory wage controls effective and politically sustainable.[MASK] This was always an optimistic notion, and became more so over time as the mid-1970s recession and the IMF loan reduced the scope for ‘flanking’ wage restraint with progressive social policies. Nor was the party well prepared to confront the hard choices which coalition would require. For instance, most Liberal voters in 1974 saw the party as closer to the Conservatives than to Labour, whereas Liberal activists leaned to the left and (as the row over Heath’s coalition offer showed) were generally hostile to working with the Tories.[MASK] The broad but shallow nature of the Liberal breakthrough can also be seen as a reflection of Thorpe’s leadership style. As Peter Bessell noted, the February 1974 campaign was ‘a personal triumph for Jeremy’:In an age dominated by TV personalities, he succeeded in conveying to the viewers the policies of his party in simple terms while projecting a personal image of statesmanship fortified by idealism.[MASK] Heath’s lack of charisma and charm created a political opening which Thorpe energetically filled. At his best, he helped the Liberals tap into an iconoclastic mood while remaining a ‘safe’ option for erstwhile Tory voters. Yet Thorpe’s focus on publicity rather than ideas also came at a political cost, and by the time of the October election there were signs that his appeal was already waning.[MASK] His reputation as ‘a preening dandy who adored the limelight’ tended to undermine the credibility of Liberal policies and to obscure the more creative currents of activism at the Liberal grass roots.[MASK] This made it easy for critics to portray the party as a narrowly electoral machine, characterised by ‘rootless opportunism and occasional poujaedism’ (as the Labour MP Phillip Whitehead put it in 1981), rather than a principled political movement.[MASK] Even so, the legacies of 1974 lived on, most obviously in the SDP/Liberal Alliance. Roy Jenkins’s landmark 1979 Dimbleby Lecture drew heavily on the critique of ‘adversary politics’ that had emerged earlier in the decade; if the voice was unmistakeably Jenkins’s own, most of the words could have been written by John Pardoe or S.E. Finer. The Gang of Four gave the Alliance the gravitas which Thorpe had lacked, though Jenkins’s lacklustre performance in the 1983 campaign suggested that this was a dubious asset. Thatcher’s confident leadership and renewed popularity after the Falklands War also made it hard to present constitutional reform as an urgent response to a looming crisis. The SDP’s focus groups in the run-up to the 1983 election found that the language of stability and national unity still resonated, but this was ‘not interpreted as meaning a need for centrist policies’ so much as allowing Thatcher to ‘finish the job’ she had embarked on.[CITATION-173]","Colchester, University of Essex Special Collections, Social Democratic Party papers, Box 32F, Specialist Research Unit, ‘SDP Research: Final Report.

To purchase a pardon bought into the notion of reconciliation with the Crown. Given the apparent damage done to her reputation and even that of her tenants by association with ‘false traitors’ to the king, the abbess may have regarded the pardon as having a symbolic value within the local community which outweighed the potential tarnish of the rebel status that accompanied it.[MASK] The reasons for obtaining a pardon were complex, but for women the analysis has skewed heavily towards explaining why female pardons are not reflective of actual activity. Much has been made of the concept of diminished responsibility, which would lead us to expect greater proportions of singlewomen and widows in the pardon rolls, as they would need individual protection rather than being able to appeal to a male relative. Yet this is not what we see: wives with and without their husbands make up a far greater proportion of the women who appear in pardon rolls.

The destruction of Louvain library in August 1914 and the shelling of Reims Cathedral by the German army in late September became points of reference for German ‘barbarism’.[MASK] The violence on the Western Front in 1914 provoked an international outcry and initiated a discourse that viewed cultural destruction against the standard of international law as embodied in the Hague Convention.[MASK] These events were unique in their function as mobilising myths at the beginning of the conflict, but cultural destruction itself was not confined to Western Europe.The Austrian bombardment of Belgrade at the start of the conflict caused significant damage to the University of Belgrade and the Serbian national museum.[MASK] During its occupation of Serbia, which began in 1915, the Bulgarian army pursued a policy of ‘denationalisation’ in eastern Serbia, which sought to eradicate Serbian cultural influence through the destruction of books, manuscripts and archives.[MASK] This cultural violence mirrored that which had been seen during the Balkan Wars of 1912–13.[MASK] In the east, the occupying German army claimed that the retreating Russian forces were responsible for the destruction and looting of cultural objects such as statues, church bells and archives.[MASK] On the Italian front, the Austrian and German forces conducted bombing raids between 1915 and 1918 which caused significant damage to churches, museums, libraries and archives in towns and cities in northern Italy.[MASK] Following the bombing of Venice in 1918, one French newspaper remarked that ‘nothing is sacred to the Germans’, likening this bombardment to that of Reims Cathedral in 1914.[MASK] In 1918, the German guns shelled Paris, leading to the destruction of the nave of the thirteenth-century church of St Gervais.[MASK] Both the British Museum in London and the Bodleian Library in Oxford began making preparations for an aerial bombardment in 1915.[MASK] After the international outcry that followed the burning of Louvain and the bombardment of Reims, the German army took special care to protect cultural sites in occupied Belgium and later in the territories under its occupation in the east.[CITATION-32]","Sandholtz, Prohibiting Plunder, pp. 106–7; Liulevičius, War Land on the Eastern Front, p. 130.",0

In some cases this reflected intensive campaign techniques (pioneered by the Liverpool councillor Trevor Jones and deployed to great effect at Sutton and Cheam) and the personal appeal of strong local candidates, but it also suggested a growing openness to the party’s national message, particularly as class-based loyalties started to wither. The political scientist Michael Steed, who stood as the Liberal candidate at Manchester Exchange, thought that ‘the key to the mood of the electorate was “the feeling of utter powerlessness”’.[MASK] Though many male manual workers in the constituency were still Labour partisans, their wives seemed more receptive to Steed’s campaign, not least because of dissatisfaction with the Labour-run city council over housing conditions.[MASK] Peter Hain also detected ‘a growing feeling of rootlessness’, which went hand in hand with ‘a deep antipathy towards modern, centralised Party machines’.[MASK] After jumping in the opinion polls during summer 1973 and peaking at 29 per cent with National Opinion Polls (NOP) on 13 October, Liberal support drifted downwards as the winter closed in and the miners’ dispute took hold.[MASK] Some Liberals feared that they would be squeezed out in a ‘crisis election’; instead, Heath’s decision to call an early poll on the question of ‘Who governs?’ played straight into the party’s hands.[MASK] The row between the Conservative government and the NUM and the resulting ‘three-day week’ powerfully dramatised the Liberal claim that adversarial politics had brought the country to a standstill, allowing Thorpe to pose as an honest broker who would ‘unite the centre’ and ‘isolate the extremists on the right and left in the national interest’.[MASK] ‘If we can offer to bring peace to Industry’, he told candidates at the beginning of the three-week campaign, ‘I believe that Liberals will gain massive support at the Polls’.[MASK] The Liberal campaign for the February election was ‘patched together very hurriedly in January’, but the momentum which the party had gained over the previous year meant that it fielded more than 500 candidates for the first time since the Second World War, allowing Thorpe to declare that ‘If you want a Liberal Government you can have one’.[MASK] Thorpe himself spent most of the election in Barnstaple and appeared at press conferences via a specially installed video link, which helped to accentuate his detachment from the verbal dogfight between Heath and Wilson.[MASK] The Liberals also benefited from a relatively generous allocation of party political broadcasts (divided between the parties in a ratio of 5:5:3) and increased television news coverage once the short campaign began: the party ‘almost doubled its share of news coverage’ compared with 1970, and Thorpe ‘made skilled use of the nightly opportunity to present a fresh and constructive image’.[MASK] Finally, the party spent over £25,000 on a series of press advertisements and ‘Take Power’ posters, orchestrated by the advertising executive and Liberal candidate Adrian Slade.[CITATION-89]","J.

Elena Carrera, for example, has situated the passions within broader medieval and early modern understandings of health and disease, demonstrating that health was characterised in this period by both a ‘lively body and cheerful mind’ and that psychological disturbances, caused by disordered passions, could result in bodily diseases.[MASK] Similarly, Hannah Newton and Olivia Weisser have explored how the passions intersected with early modern experiences of physical illness. While positively construed passions, such as mirth, could signal that a person had been restored to bodily health, watching the agony of loved ones could cause an emotional response in the friends and family of patients which might lead them to fall ill in sympathy.[MASK] Moving beyond this scholarship, this article locates the health of the passions in a broader framework of early modern preventative healthcare and analyses how early modern people attempted to control their passions through everyday comfort eating. Tessa Storey and Sandra Cavallo have demonstrated the importance of prevention for governing the passions and ensuring a healthy body. This could be achieved in a variety of ways: for example, theologians and physicians encouraged people to detach themselves through prayer and spiritual exercises from the worldly cares that could trigger the production of unwanted passions.[MASK] Storey and Cavallo’s intervention, although welcome, has served to separate the passions from other aspects of life that could impact emotional health. This is partly a result of Storey and Cavallo structuring their book around the six non-natural things—the six spheres of life—including air, food and drink, rest and exercise, sleep and waking, excretions and retentions, and the passions of the mind, that could impact the proper functioning of the body, but is also the result of a wider trend to examine these six non-naturals separately.[MASK] Illnesses caused by disturbed passions could be managed through the careful regulation of all the six non-natural things. The ‘passions’ were both one of the six non-naturalsan internal bodily reaction. Unsurprisingly, the sixth non-natural known as the ‘passions of the mind’ was most closely connected to the production of bodily passions and the diseases associated with them. The ‘passions of the mind’, can, in their simplest form, be defined as the external social triggers and experiences that could lead to the creation of unwanted passions within the body and it is on this aspect of emotional health that scholars such as Storey and Cavallo have focused their attention.[MASK] By examining practices of comfort eating, this article reveals the extent to which the health of the passions was also reliant on wider lifestyle decisions, including what a person ate on a daily basis.Of all the six non-naturals, diet has been the subject of the most detailed historical analysis. Numerous works have demonstrated the role played by food and drink in early modern conceptions of health and disease, but surprisingly little has been said about the role of diet in the regulation of the passions and the illnesses that they were believed to generate.[CITATION-13]","Recent scholarship on diet and good health includes D.

Firstly, the Young Liberal Movement (YLs) had boomed as a result of an influx of left-leaning students who were attracted by Thorpe’s attacks on apartheid and angered by the Wilson government’s equivocations over the Vietnam War.[MASK] Attempts to commit the party to an anti-NATO stance at its 1966 Assembly led the media to label YL activists as ‘Red Guards’, and the leading role which Hain and other YLs played in the Stop the Seventy Tour campaign against the white South African cricket team kept the movement in the limelight in the run-up to the 1970 election. Some older Liberals, such as Arthur Slack of the National Union of Liberal Clubs, blamed the YLs for the party’s losses in 1970, and matters came to a head later in the year when the former YL chairman Louis Eaks was widely accused of stoking antisemitism.[MASK] Thorpe responded by commissioning Stephen Terrell QC to lead a controversial and largely fruitless inquiry into the YLs and their relationship with the wider party.[MASK] A second area of Liberal growth lay in the party’s efforts to expand its local government presence from small towns and seaside resorts to inner-city areas, especially those where Labour’s political organisation had decayed through neglect, industrial decline, or unpopular rehousing schemes.[MASK] The most striking example of this progress came in Birmingham, where Wallace Lawler won Newtown ward in 1962, turned it into a political base, and then gained Birmingham Ladywood from Labour in a 1969 parliamentary by-election.[MASK] Lawler, a plastics manufacturer, described himself as ‘an unofficial Ombudsman for the whole of the city’ and built up his profile through populist campaigns—for instance, by taking a thousand Birmingham pensioners to Downing Street to protest against rising electricity charges.[MASK] Yet this ‘rebirth of working-class Liberalism’—as Brian Priestley of theput it—came with a sting in the tail, as Lawler broke from the party’s liberal line on immigration to complain about ‘ugly problems’ of overcrowding and venereal disease among immigrant groups, and called for labour permits in Birmingham to be restricted until these problems were solved.[MASK] Lawler’s flirtation with nativism was by no means typical of Liberal councillors, but a 1971 row over a traveller site in Barnsley suggested that it was not an isolated case.[CITATION-33]","According to the minutes of the party’s national executive, ‘the gypsies in question were scrap metal dealers who had taken over the green play area of a housing estate’, and ‘Cllr.

It sets out to study popular patriotism in its own terms and contends that urban history offers a productive way to situate patriotic mobilisation in the local and national contexts in which it took place. Indeed, this article argues that wartime patriotism ought to be considered as part of a larger reflection on the political and cultural geography of France in the era of the Great War. Historians of the First World War long assumed that the process of nationalisation of the French polity had reached its apex in August 1914. In recent years, however, a string of works on France and Germany have demonstrated that nation-making and processes of centralisation had not entailed the withering of local identities.[MASK] The urban history of wartime mobilisation offers a fruitful way to study the articulation of national and infra-national identities and to rescue patriotism from the idealistic and exclusionary definition that nationalists sought to impose upon their contemporaries and historians alike. Moreover, this article suggests that a decentred approach to national mobilisation, focusing on peripheral and, in this case, southern regions of France, may shed critical light on the nature and process of national mobilisation.The distinctions between nationalism and patriotism, between theand patriotic mobilisation are not simply of relevance to continuing historiographical debate. In present-day commemorative contexts, they are also critical if historians are to challenge successfully the growing assertion of regionalist and essentialist definitions of social identities that threaten to undermine public understanding of the conflict. It is indeed striking to see how the centenary of the war and the flurry of activities, events and publications it generated, reactivated conventional as well as regional narratives of victimisation.

Yet, historians of the Breton or southern experiences of the war also lend credence to such regionalist interpretations when they appear to endorse theas an ideal-type of national mobilisation.[MASK] This article draws on a rich scholarly field in which historians of the urban experience of the war have, over the last two decades, framed their contributions in both local and comparative terms.[CITATION-25]","R.

For local social movements and conflicts did not merely demonstrate the frailty of the consensus stipulated by the prescriptions of nationalism. Instead, urban contention constituted a critical mediation of the war experience, whereby national and infra-national identities were asserted, mobilised and played out on the urban stage. Urban civil societies thus ensured, to a large extent, the success of national mobilisation in France. It is also at the urban level that the contingent, ongoing and contested nature of these mobilisations appears most clearly. To look at the urban therefore sheds critical light on both the nature and mobilisation of patriotic cultures in First World War France.By adopting this local focus—on Béziers—we can document the significance of infra-national identities and repertoires of contention in enough detail to scrutinise the articulation of urban, regional and national processes of mobilisation. This question of differing scales of analysis is relevant to the study of all belligerent societies. It is, however, of particular importance for historians of the French Third Republic (1871–1940), whose source base reflects, and is determined by, the political structures of this monist and universalist political regime. As a result, histories of France have often echoed and reinforced the political hierarchy and cultural distinctions that the centralised Republic conventionally made between the nation, theand the localities and municipalities. For all their richness, departmental studies rely on sources produced by and for the prefectoral administration which held authority over all civilian functionaries in the area.[CITATION-27]","An excellent example, focusing on the Isère département, is P.J.

But while the French historiography of the Great War remains dynamic, a long-standing scholarly controversy over the nature of a specific ‘war culture’ has led to wartime mobilisation being analysed in misleadingly dichotomous terms as a process shaped either by consent or by coercion.[MASK] Typified by two schools of interpretation that respectively stress either popular consent to the war or the coercive power of the state apparatus, this debate continues to be framed in terms of opposition between cultural and social historians.[MASK] As a result, French patriotic mobilisation remains poorly understood.This article aims to move past the artificial impasse created by the existing historiographical controversy and to suggest instead that urban history can provide key insights into the dynamics of mobilisation. The argument is centred on a case-study, that of Béziers in southern France. It offers a definition of patriotism that accounts for the expression of distinct territorial identities. To do this, it builds on pragmatic approaches to social history and social identities and stresses in particular the conflictual nature of patriotic mobilisation.[MASK] The article argues indeed that it was the very contested and pluralist nature of wartime mobilisation that was the key to the success of the French war effort.At the heart of what used to be known as the—the Red South—Béziers encapsulated the political culture of a region where a strong local identity had traditionally been seen as a challenge to processes of centralisation and to the national state. It is therefore an appropriate test-case for the decentred approach to national mobilisation that this article propounds. The fact that the town had witnessed a dramatic stand-off between the state and the army at a somewhat earlier date, in 1907, makes it important to examine the articulation of patriotism and local repertoires of contention before 1914. By virtue of its position at the heart of winemaking industry, Béziers also allows us to consider the interaction of town and country: the expression of urban and rural responses to the war. The article scrutinises the wartime mobilisation of southern identities and approaches the military experience of the locality. It also highlights the ethical dimensions of the process of patriotic mobilisation and finally underlines the specificities of urban wartime politics.The intensity of the historiographical dispute over the French war effort in 1914–18 has obscured the fact that protagonists on both sides of the argument paradoxically share what one may call—for lack of a better term—a ‘consensualist’ view of wartime mobilisation. Indeed, the idea that wartime mobilisation stemmed from theand from a rather improbable national consensus remains surprisingly prevalent across the divide drawn by the controversy. For Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker and many others, national mobilisation was the effect and product of a patriotic consensus crystallised by war violence into a specific ‘war culture’.[MASK] For Rémy Cazals, Frédéric Rousseau, Nicolas Offenstadt and André Loez, strikes and mutinies demonstrate that national mobilisation was only made possible and maintained by the exercise of state coercion and propaganda.[CITATION-10]","R.

John Pardoe, for instance, warned in lurid terms that Britain was ‘approaching that situation of “explosive inflation” which has been experienced in so many South American countries’, which would be ‘a danger to our society, to our politics, to our Parliamentary Institutions, to our very democracy’. Though he rejected monetarism on the grounds that mass unemployment was unacceptable, he argued that ‘the menace of inflation must be met; met hard; and met now’, and accused the Labour Chancellor, Denis Healey, of attempting to evade the problem.[MASK] Faced with an interventionist Labour government and corporate alarm about a ‘profits squeeze’, some Liberal MPs also began to worry about the survival of the market economy. Pardoe declared that Labour’s attempt to hold down prices through controls and subsidies was ‘nuts’, while Wainwright warned that ‘Export-led growth cannot be achieved by State-shackled manufacturing industry’.[MASK] Even Thorpe claimed that Britain had become ‘a nation living beyond its means, with a standard of living which cannot be sustained by our current level of economic activity’. Sooner or later, the Liberal leader insisted, the government would have to be honest with the electorate about the need for sacrifice.[MASK] This gloomy analysis of Britain’s economic position meant that the Liberal message in the October 1974 campaign sat rather awkwardly with the glitzy style which Thorpe had chosen. The party had calculated that a vote share of 26–28 per cent would deliver a much larger block of MPs, and Thorpe hoped that his tour of target seats—first by hovercraft and then by helicopter—would help attract the media coverage required for a national breakthrough.[MASK] In addition to television news coverage, the Liberals gained sympathetic treatment from much of the press, which discussed the party’s manifesto ‘with unprecedented seriousness’ and covered Thorpe’s speeches at length.[MASK] Alastair Hetherington ofechoed the Liberal argument that ‘consensus’ could be ‘tough, progressive, and fair’, whileendorsed a GNU and,, and thesupported a Conservative–Liberal coalition with varying degrees of clarity.[MASK] By Liberal standards, the campaign was also well resourced, though the party was still poorer than its rivals. Across the two elections of 1974, Conservative Central Office spent over £1.6 million and Transport House just under £1 million, while even the inclusion of Thorpe’s direct aid accounts only took central Liberal spending to about £300,000.[MASK] At constituency level, the gap was smaller: Liberal candidates’ election expenses averaged £725 in October, compared with £1,275 for Conservatives and £1,163 for Labour candidates.[MASK] Alongside the national campaign, the Liberals concentrated their efforts on about forty ‘critical marginals’, drawing on the work of the Winnable Seats Committee, which Thorpe had established in the 1960s, and the experience which agents such as John Spiller had gained in the 1972–3 by-elections.[CITATION-121]","Bloch, Jeremy Thorpe, p. 408; Financial Times, 30 Sept. 1974, p. 25.

Taking such asymmetries to their extreme, policyholders could even over-insure a vessel with multiple unwitting underwriters and then deliberately sink it, walking away with a handsome profit.[MASK] Moral hazard—that is, the capacity for parties to enter an insurance policy in bad faith—thus underpinned the instrument’s capacity to engender chaos in commercial life.[MASK] As a tool for managing risk, insurance was itself risky.The two companies in thedispute operated within this environment of suspicion towards insurance. Although surprisingly little has been written about it, the Royal Insurance Company was entirely typical of the privileged corporate model exploited by the French state in the 1680s.[MASK] It was the pet project of Jean-Baptiste Antoine Colbert, marquis de Seignelay, who succeeded his famous father as secretary of state for maritime affairs () in 1683.[MASK] Following in his father’s footsteps—Colbert had created an ill-fated insurance chamber in Paris in 1668—Seignelay established the Royal Insurance Company in 1686 with the intention of challenging the dominance of Amsterdam’s and London’s markets, at the same time as reducing the outflow of specie from France in premiums in a period where coinage was in short supply.[MASK] He also hoped the Royal Insurance Company’s conduct would serve as a model for underwriters across France, thereby addressing prevailing fears of moral hazard in the insurance industry.[MASK] Seignelay had restructured the French East India Company () and created the Guinea Company () in 1685 to encourage small groups of wealthyto invest in the state’s commercial projects. A‘was any person who handled the king’s money’, but many were close allies of the Crown who were essential in supporting the public debt, especially in times of war, through their services as tax farmers.[MASK] Following the model of these companies, Seignelay encouraged thirty, royal allies and notable merchants to invest a total of 300,000 livres in the Royal Insurance Company. Five of these shareholders were selected to serve as directors at any one time, being replaced in a fixed pattern every six months. These directors handled the company’s activities, agreeing and signing insurance policies on behalf of all the shareholders, who shared any profits or losses with the directors equally.[MASK] Among the shareholders was Jean-Baptiste de Lagny, who had been appointed by Seignelay as director general of commerce () in 1686. Lagny had extensive ties to royal finance, and served as a general farmer for the state from 1680 onwards.[MASK] Profit was not the central motivation for those who joined. As part of the institution’s letters patent, Seignelay presented shareholders with a suite of privileges: most significantly, they were given priority in filling vacancies in the directorship of the French East India Company, and a company shareholder was chosen every two years to serve as a judge on Paris’s prestigious merchant court.[MASK] The social, commercial and legal privileges of membership meant, to quote David Bien, that ‘the return was a different kind, one measured not in money but in the psychic satisfaction found in enhanced social standing’ and access to networks of royal patronage.[CITATION-24]","D.

Being unwilling to participate in the widespread practice of sharing food could indicate that the passions were in disarray. These negative passions, as we see in the case of Lowe, could also be transferred to those whose invitation to partake in commensality had been snubbed.Food was also gifted or shared at emotionally sensitive times, again suggesting that there was a link between specific foodstuffs and the regulation of the passions, and that this connection shaped people’s everyday social engagement with food. For example, Isaac Archer described in his diary the death of his mother and two siblings when he was eight years old. He explained that his schoolmistress, who had been with his mother when she had died, had brought him cake and that because he was ‘but a child’ he was ‘more pleased with the cakes … then grieved for so unspeakable a loss’.[MASK] The fact that his schoolmistress provided the young Isaac with cake at this moment of extreme emotional trauma again points to the role of food, particularly pleasurable foods, in attempts to stave off negative passions. Similar examples can be found in the correspondence of Lord Fitzwilliam and in Josselin’s diary. Fitzwilliam noted in his letters that his wife had been gifted chine and black pudding by a Mrs Bull on several occasions. One such gift came soon after the death of their son William, which had left Lady Fitzwilliam ‘so afflicted’, presumably with grief, that her husband worried it would ‘put her into a fitt of sickness’.[MASK] Ken Albala has suggested that the gifting of black pudding had strong affective resonances, as this was a foodstuff that was believed to be especially beneficial for replenishing blood and thus keeping the body in good working order. By sending Lady Fitzwilliam black pudding, Mrs Bull sent not only a ‘symbol of heart-felt affection’ but also a healthy food that would help Lady Fitzwilliam recover from her grief.[MASK] Josselin also wrote in his diary about receiving gifts of food in the aftermath of a child’s death. His son Ralph had died when he was just a baby and he had been buried with ‘the teares and sorrow not onely of the parents and Mrs Mary Church, but with the teares and sorrowe of many of my [Josselin’s] neighbours’.[MASK] In the days that followed baby Ralph’s funeral, Josselin described suffering terribly. He also remarked, however, that his and his family’s suffering had been eased by the kindness of Mary Church. In an entry from just two weeks after Ralph’s burial, Josselin wrote that he and his wife were now feeling ‘indifferently well and cheerly’. He also noted that Mary Church had procured for his dinner some calf’s head, which he ‘much desired’ and that she had been ‘as kind to, and tender of’ he and his wife ‘as if shee were our sister’.[CITATION-113]","Ibid., pp. 114–18.",1

The BES survey found an enormous ‘churn’ in Liberal support, as the party lost almost half its February voters but gained about two million others.[MASK] The party’s post-election inquests revealed a range of views. David Steel argued that the Liberal message had been ‘too intellectual and too complicated’ and that the party needed to strengthen its appeal to ‘erstwhile Labour voters’, but some activists felt that Thorpe and Steel’s musings about coalition had alienated precisely this group.[MASK] Some members of the national executive thought the emphasis on ‘the gravity of the country’s economic situation’ had been overdone, to the detriment of ‘other matters of equally vital concern to the people’. Others complained that ‘the image of frivolity surrounding the Leader … contrasted with the serious nature of the campaign’, and that the party had ‘failed to promote’ the ‘grass roots campaigning image’ implied by the community politics strategy.[MASK] R.W. Johnson has characterised the period between 1974 and 1976 as the era of the UK’s ‘Great Fear’, in which ‘parts of the establishment began seriously to consider alternatives to our present form of parliamentary democracy’.[MASK] Rapid inflation—peaking around 25 per cent in 1975—and the perceived humiliation of the 1976 IMF crisis led to widespread talk of national decline and social breakdown, reinforced by a wider cultural mood which made the 1970s ‘the golden age of paranoia’.[MASK] At the most extreme end of the spectrum, figures such as the retired general Sir Walter Walker and the Cold War strategist Brian Crozier were rumoured to be flirting with the possibility of a military coup, and New Left commentators such as Stuart Hall warned that middle-class complaints about inflation, taxation and crime would provide fertile territory for ‘authoritarian populism’.[MASK] Yet talk of realignment and constitutional change also drew on more liberal and progressive sources, including the ‘Yes’ campaign in the June 1975 referendum, which brought Heath, Jenkins and Thorpe together to argue in favour of continued EEC membership. As Robert Saunders has pointed out, ‘the spirit of cross-party solidarity embodied by Britain in Europe was widely applauded’ in the press, and the referendum result was seen as a decisive victory for ‘moderates’ over the Labour left and the Powellite right.[MASK] , for instance, followed up the referendum by calling for a centrist coalition which could give effect to the shared goals of the ‘middle majority’.[MASK] The shift from election season to the normal routines of parliamentary life made it hard for the Liberals to maintain the high public profile they had gained in 1974. Although the Labour government’s slim majority of three seats gave smaller parties some leverage, the Liberals found themselves jostling with the eleven Scottish National Party MPs, three Plaid Cymru MPs, and assorted Northern Irish politicians for influence and media coverage.[CITATION-133]","See, for instance, Steel’s comments in BLPES, Liberal Party papers, 1/8, fos 121–30, NEC minutes, 26 Apr. 1975, at fo. 127.",1
18,1.0,Pollard,Lord Fitzhugh’s Rising’,0,"in histories of political protest in Tudor England. The omission epitomises the systemic oversight of female dissent in late medieval and early Tudor England. Accounting for this omission, and starting to re-imagine what a properly constituted history of protest would look like, are the primary goals of this essay.[MASK] Popular politics in the fifteenth century, particularly the latter half, is in general an understudied area.[MASK] Yet one of the distinctive features of the later fourteenth to mid-sixteenth centuries is the recurrence of mass popular insurrections expressing collective grievance. On two occasions, 1450 and 1497, rebels (or petitioners) marched on London.[MASK] Women were demonstrably among them. Even so, most scholarly accounts up to the 1980s, and often beyond, portray revolt as a wholly male enterprise. If and when the subject of female participation is broached, it is concluded that women were little involved in public acts of dissent in England.[MASK] For example, Samuel Cohn found that ‘women, far from being the principal participants in later medieval protest, were remarkable for their absence’.[MASK] Where historians do find women at the centre of civil unrest, they explain their presence away.[MASK] The protestors, so the thinking goes, must have been interested in ‘women’s issues’: they were angry on behalf of deserted wives, such as Catherine. Their quarrel with the royal household pertained to the ‘private sphere’, without wider political significance.[MASK] By contrast, when late medieval or early modern men were involved, modern commentators decide that they spoke for a ‘common good’, and devote considerable interpretative energies to deciphering what spurred them into action, seeing—for instance—a wealth of meaning in protests about poverty, inequality or evil counsel.[MASK] The operative logic is that women can speak only for themselves, men for others. There is truly a monstrous regiment of assumptions about gender here.In her study of the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, Sylvia Federico issues a call to consider the ‘horizons of plausibility’ for women in revolt.[MASK] Pardon rolls, if not necessarily reflective of actual acts, do demonstrate the offences it was credible to suggest women could commit, and the accusations from which they felt the need to protect themselves.[MASK] Where women appear in court rolls as having committed a felony, they are often named alongside male relatives.[MASK] Several examples of such family units can be found in the pardons for the Cumberland Rebellion of 1470:The like to William Musgrave late of Edynhall, co. Cumberland, esquire, Joan Musgrave of the same, widow, Nicholas Musgrave of the same, ‘jentilman’ … Joan Robynson … Henry Fitzhugh of Fitzhugh, knight, and Alice his wife, Francis Lovell … and Anne Lovell his wife[MASK] … Richard Fitzhugh, son of the said Henry Fitzhugh, George Fitzhugh, Edward Fitzhugh, Thomas Fitzhugh and John Fitzhugh, sons of the same Henry, Elizabeth Fitzhugh, daughter of the same Henry, Joan Lovell and Frideswide, sisters of the same Francis Lovell, Katherine Clerionet wife of William Clerionet, ‘jentilman’,[MASK] Grace Pudsay late of Ravenswath,[MASK] co.

In the Belgian case this related to the destruction of the library at Louvain in 1914, whereas for France restitution went back to the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. The cultural articles of the Treaty of Versailles demonstrated the primacy to be accorded to the specific cultural claims of the main Allied nations in Western Europe; the same standard was not equally applied in the treaties of Saint-Germain, Trianon or Neuilly. Versailles also underscored the central position that Germany occupied among vanquished states.Three articles dealing with cultural reparations were inserted into the Treaty of Versailles; 245, 246 and 247.[MASK] Article 247 specifically called for reparation for the destruction of the university library of Louvain, a key point in international cultural mobilisation at the beginning of the war. Despite the centrality of Louvain to debates about cultural destruction, it was a late addition to the treaty and did not emanate from the CRD. The Belgian government tabled the proposal at the end of April 1919 directly to Clemenceau, with the drafting committee adding it to the treaty at the start of May 1919.[MASK] In his letter to Clemenceau, the Belgian foreign minister Paul Hymans cited the Hague conventions and claimed that although the damage done to Louvain could not be compensated for in monetary terms, Germany ought to make an ‘equitable compensation’.[MASK] Article 247 committed Germany to furnish ‘the University of Louvain [with] manuscripts, incunabula, printed books, maps and objects of collection corresponding in number and value to those destroyed in the burning by Germany of the Library of Louvain’. It also named two works of art to be returned to Belgium. These were the triptych of the Mystic Lamb by the Van Eyck brothers and the triptych of the Last Supper by Dieric Bouts, both of which had been acquired legitimately by German museums.[MASK] This provision constituted a form of restitution in kind for damage to Belgian property in the war and in so doing went against the resolutions of the Reparation Commission against restitution in kind of only a few weeks prior.[MASK] Lord Sumner, a judge and British representative on the CRD, wrote with some frustration that ‘the Reparation Commission had nothing to do with the clauses in the German Treaty’, by which he meant articles 246 and 247.[MASK] While the CRD sought to apply some consistency of approach, decisions regarding specific articles were sometimes taken by the Council of Four for political reasons.The example of Article 247 was not widely repeated in the other treaties and this reflects the elevated status that Belgium held at the peace conference as the ‘first victim’ of Germany in 1914. Belgium had been singled out in Wilson’s Fourteen Points as deserving full ‘restoration’ and, at the peace conference, the Belgian delegation pressured the peacemakers to ensure that they received special treatment.[MASK] The Serbian leader Nikola Pašić highlighted this inequality of treatment in a letter to Clemenceau.[CITATION-65]","Burnett, Reparation at the Paris Peace Conference, I, Document 314, p. 1076 (Pašić to Clemenceau, 29 Apr. 1919).",1

Macfarlane,The Diary of Ralph Josselin,0,"food gifts to help nurture and manage the passions of their friends, neighbours and loved ones.Some letter writers even used the memory of eating particular foods to help forge more positive passions in their correspondents. Lady Joan Barrington, a prominent Essex woman known for her godliness and patronage, had suffered from melancholy since the death of her husband, Sir Francis Barrington, in July 1628. While the puritan minister Ezekiel Rogers wrote to Barrington expressing his hope that her ‘olde disease of melancholy’ had been ‘banished away by faith’, her son Thomas and her steward Tobias continued to express concern over her persistent ‘sadness’.[MASK] Tobias, in a bid to cheer up Barrington, sent her some capons in December 1629 in the hope that they would help her ‘health and stomach’ and be eaten ‘with as much joy and mirth as ever capons weare’.[MASK] In reminding Barrington of the joy that could be sparked through eating, Tobias no doubt hoped his mistress’s long battle with melancholy would end. Like sugar, capons were also considered to be particularly healthy. As Cogan noted, capons were the most ‘agreeable’ type of flesh, ‘as well in sicknesse as in health’, as they were light of digestion.[MASK] Barrington seemingly recognised this, as she too was accustomed to gift capons to her loved ones. Johanna St John, Barrington’s granddaughter, was delighted to receive several such birds from her grandmother, declaring that there is ‘no greater dantis [dainty] then a country capon’.[MASK] Eating together could also have similarly desirable outcomes for the passions. Medical authorities recommended that a state of cheerfulness could be achieved through pleasant diversions, mild intellectual stimulation and the invigoration of the senses.[MASK] In the, the English translation of the Dutch physician Levinus Lemnius’s, moderate banqueting is endorsed as one such cheerful activity. For melancholic people, who were known to be especially sullen, it was advised they ‘use banquetting and good cheere amonge honest and mery company’ to improve the health of their passions.[MASK] This advice seems to have been enthusiastically followed by those who could afford such diversions. George Davenport, an Anglican clergyman living in the north of England, recorded in his many letters to his former tutor at Cambridge, William Sancroft, the pleasure he derived from eating with company.[MASK] Having eaten with his friends a pottage made from pork, cabbage and leeks in Paris, he described himself and his companions as ‘very merry’. Similarly, he noted that one year he kept a ‘jolly Christmas’, having dined some days with up to 200 people.[MASK] Ralph Josselin also interpreted communal eating as a means to inculcate good cheer and feelings of affection. On the baptism of his child, for example, he arranged a banquet for his neighbours at great personal expense, during which they showed him ‘much love’. He also spent many evenings eating with his friends. In one entry, he explained how he was ‘lovingly invited’ to his ‘neighbour Matthewes to dinner and at supper to Mrs Churches’ where he experienced ‘loving and plentifull entertainment’.[CITATION-107]","Diary of Ralph Josselin, ed.

This problematised the vision of class struggle articulated by earlier left-wing figures.had framed itself as the intellectual vanguard needed to lead ordinary people in their inevitable struggle against the capitalist state. But Madge now believed working-class cultures were powerful and creative enough to organise themselves. He argued for a society structured so that the idiosyncratic patterns of social life which he had explored in the regions could be reproduced on a national basis.Michael Young was another left-wing sociologist who benefited from these new opportunities. Before the war Young had initially worked as a solicitor at McKenna and Company, before taking an Economics degree at the LSE, where he attended additional classes in political science, commercial law, and social and economic history.[MASK] At the same time, he also remained active in the world of London grass-roots socialism. There were strong links in the 1930s between the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA), the Labour Party, and local left-wing community projects, with which M-O itself had been involved.[MASK] Young was involved in these endeavours while at the LSE, through his activism with the Communist Party, and as a member of the WEA.[MASK] Young was particularly interested in exploring how the vibrancy of working-class culture might be encouraged. The war effort gave him an ideal opportunity to think this through, as community-based projects such as the WEA were co-opted into the expanded civil defence and military apparatus.[MASK] He founded the state-funded Industrial Discussion Clubs Experiment in 1943, along witheditor Amabel Williams-Ellis and the Marxist art historian Alan Jarvis. These were essentially WEA discussion sessions replicated in a factory setting. As Jarvis later explained, their groups attempted to provide safe spaces where ‘the real contemporary problems of real people’ might come to the fore.[MASK] In 1939 Young secured a position as a researcher for Political and Economic Planning, the think-tank founded in 1931 by Max Nicholson. He began to study how the new institutions of the wartime state interacted with pre-existing patterns of working-class life, while ‘carrying out all sorts of welfare work’ in Blitz-era London.[MASK] His findings were presented in a PEP research pamphlet published in 1941 on the management of the wartime social services. Far from destroying them, Young found that the London County Council’s shelter policies had bolstered working-class initiatives. In Bermondsey, co-operation between ‘the local authority, the ARP organisations, voluntary bodies and representatives of the shelter population’ had produced a flourishing sense of community.[MASK] The council had distributed books and allocated more spaces for civic use. The community in turn used these to organise adult education classes, lead collective reading and wireless groups, and encourage workshops in painting and creative writing. State policy therefore did not ‘replace’ working-class culture, and could instead ‘provide new and richer opportunities’ for its development.[MASK] Moreover, it cut across the barriers imposed by socio-economic class. New community schemes helped to foster ‘unexpected sources of social leadership’, with working-class residents leading their middle-class neighbours in communal activities.[CITATION-58]","CCA, YUNG 2/2/1, ‘Social Services’.",1

The broad geographical spread of Liberal support, however, meant that the party won only fourteen seats: holding three of the five by-election gains, retaking Colne Valley and Bodmin (which had been lost in 1970), and adding the Isle of Wight, Hazel Grove, and Cardigan. Data from the British Election Study (BES) suggests that almost half of the new Liberal voters had not voted in 1970, and that the rest were drawn fairly evenly from Labour and the Conservatives; however, some of the Labour-to-Liberal switchers may have been tactically motivated, since most of the Liberals’ strongest performances (including more than four-fifths of their 146 second places) came in Tory constituencies.[MASK] In particular, the Liberals established themselves as the main challengers to the Conservatives across a broad swathe of southern England, coming second in sixty-eight out of 105 Tory-held seats south of the Thames, and made particularly big strides in London suburbs and commuter seats such as Richmond, Twickenham, and Guildford.[MASK] By contrast, the Liberal results bore little relationship to local government activity, perhaps because the dark February nights were not well suited to pavement politics. Indeed, Liverpool Wavertree—where the incoming council leader Cyril Carr was the Liberal candidate—was one of only two English seats where the Liberal vote share went down.[MASK] Who were the six million Liberal voters? Analysis of the BES and other opinion surveys suggests four main patterns. Firstly, Liberal voters were disproportionately young: for instance, the BES found that 27 per cent of under-25s and 23 per cent of 25- to 34- year-olds supported the Liberals, falling to 10 per cent among those aged 75 and over.[MASK] The Conservative Party’s private polling of 16–28 year olds also highlighted ‘[t]he disruptive effect of the Liberals on the political loyalties of the young’, and suggested that young women and those with ‘more and higher educational qualifications than the age group as a whole’ were particularly likely to switch to Thorpe’s party.[MASK] Secondly, as in the 1960s, the Liberals did better among the ‘salariat’ and other white-collar groups than among manual workers.[MASK] Thirdly, Liberal voters gave Thorpe high leadership ratings, particularly compared to Heath, whose battle with the NUM had made him seem both combative and ineffectual. Unlike Heath and Wilson, Thorpe’s ratings ran well ahead of his party’s, supporting the widespread view that his television appearances had been an important asset.[MASK] Fourthly, Liberal voters tended to be less satisfied with the British political system than Labour or Conservative supporters.[MASK] It is difficult to draw broader conclusions about political attitudes, since the February BES survey was relatively short (and therefore light on policy questions), but the October survey suggested that Liberal voters were disproportionately likely to believe that both ‘big business’ and trade unions had too much power, and held broadly but not overwhelmingly liberal views on issues such as race and women’s equality.[CITATION-100]","Ibid., pp. 352–4.",1

In Zambia—whose president, Kenneth Kaunda, was, with Obote and Nyerere, a member of the informal ‘Mulungushi club’ of self-styled radical national leaders—the ruling party had won elections overwhelmingly in 1968.[MASK] Kenya held national elections in December 1969. The spectacular politics of stateness in the region meant that, at summits and at annual commemorations of independence, Obote was increasingly on show alongside presidents whose legitimacy was newly burnished by electoral success. On the other side of the continent—but looming large for Uganda’s intellectuals—Ghana held elections in 1969, after a prolonged transition following the overthrow of Kwame Nkrumah in 1966. Nkrumah, arguably Africa’s most prominent politician of the independence era, had treated Obote and the UPC rather as protégés.[MASK] The coup that toppled him was denounced (not without cause) as the result of neo-colonialist conspiracy; when the coup leader passed through Uganda’s airportto a meeting in Ethiopia, Obote seized the opportunity to confront him publicly.[MASK] But an alternative narrative presented Nkrumah’s fall as the result of having lost touch with the people—most starkly evidenced in Ghana’s ‘elections’ of 1965, in which no ballots were cast and every ruling party candidate (including Nkrumah) was returned unopposed. Mazrui had used a book review into state that argument publicly.[MASK] Angry readers denounced Mazrui, but the argument struck home: the British High Commissioner reported privately that Obote had concluded that Nkrumah had failed to ‘keep in touch with reality’.[MASK] Circumstances within Uganda also encouraged discussion of elections and raised the possibility that, rather than being a threat, the ballot might itself be the means to educate the public. Despite Obote’s boast that the ‘revolution’ had vanquished feudalism, he and others were acutely aware of the persistent support for the monarchy in Buganda after 1966. Leaflets written in the name of a ‘Secret Council’ circulated widely, threatening violence against the state, and there were sporadic actual attacks, including one on Obote’s motorcade in 1968.[MASK] The government’s response was partly blunt repression—the arrest and detention without trial of a significant number of real or imagined opponents, including the main leaders of the DP. The characterisation of this period as a ‘consolidation of dictatorship’ in which space for debate was closed down is partly accurate.[MASK] But Obote and his allies also saw the challenge as an educational one, and imagined the ballot as a solution to this—and as a way to turn the ruling party into a more effective tool of control.The UPC had always been a problem for Obote. In his rhetoric, the party was a vanguard of transformation. In practice, it was a consortium of locally influential ‘big men’. After independence the party had been riven by a struggle between a minority of young radicals and this established hierarchy. In that struggle Obote had leaned first towards the big men and then—once the radicals were excluded from key offices—increasingly against them. Among academics, the weakness of the UPC, and its dominance by regional big men, was accepted fact.[CITATION-65]","C. Gertzel, ‘Report from Kampala’, Africa Report, ix, no. 9 (1964), pp. 3–7; C.
