    "article": "This article provides an in-depth cultural study of England\u2019s urban middling sort\u2014those in-between wage labourers and the gentry\u2014at the beginning of the seventeenth century, concentrating on one community in a major street in Bristol. This demographic has long been of interest to historians seeking to understand the major social changes of the early modern period, but little is known about the total urban experience of such individuals prior to the Restoration. Wine Street was home to goldsmiths\u2019 standings and shops, instrument-makers, inn-holding widows, aldermen, mayors, and one of the longest-running playhouses in early modern England outside of London\u2014a venue run by Nicholas and Margaret Woolfe. This study seeks to understand more about the everyday lives of this crucial demographic through a holistic micro-history of one particular community\u2014grounding them in a specific place and time and providing an earlier case-study than is generally available in existing literature. Doing so demonstrates how middling status was complicated and defined by neighbourhood, marriage, widowhood, and inheritance. More widely, this group of Wine Street tradespeople, artisans and proprietors lived in a location that was in large part distinguished by forms of \u2018play\u2019, the elastic early modern term used here to refer to various forms of commercial recreation, from drama to inn-going to luxury shopping. I establish how, in such urban environments, middling status can be distinctly recognised in the imbrication of play with cultural and commercial identity.Margaret Thomas, widow and inn manager, married the cutler Nicholas Woolfe in Bristol in 1605. For the next decade, the Woolfes oversaw the earliest years of the longest-running theatre in early modern England outside of London\u2014the Wine Street tenement \u2018comonlie called the playehouse\u2019.[CITATION-1] The immediate neighbourhood included an array of tradesmen with links to the city\u2019s Common Council; the shops of the prominent local goldsmiths Humphrey Clovell and Richard Harsell; recently built standings for goldsmiths from all over the country; a bookseller and instrument-maker; and two inns that acted as hubs both for wider civic entertainment and official parish recreation. This micro-historical study takes the Woolfes and their neighbours as representatives of a particular urban \u2018middling sort\u2019: the large and diverse group of people who sat, financially and socially, between wage labourers and the gentry or landed elite; those citizens who worked for their living but who held economic, political and cultural capital within their community. The burgeoning of this social group from the 1550s onwards increased social mobility, helped create a boom in consumer goods, generated new artistic forms and produced some of the most famous names of the English Renaissance, from William Shakespeare to Nicholas Hilliard. Yet we have limited knowledge of the way in which the varied cultural experiences of middling individuals united the different aspects of their lives, from profession or trade to public office.[CITATION-2] This article seeks to understand more about the everyday lives of this crucial demographic through a holistic micro-history of one particular community, grounding its members in a specific place and time and providing an earlier case-study than is generally available in the existing literature. It demonstrates how middling status was complicated and defined by neighbourhood, marriage, widowhood and inheritance. More widely, the group of Wine Street tradespeople, artisans and proprietors examined in this article lived in a location that was in large part distinguished by forms of \u2018play\u2019\u2014the elastic early modern term used here to refer to various forms of commercial recreation, from drama to inn-going to luxury shopping. I establish here how, in such urban environments, middling status can be distinctly recognised in the imbrication of play with cultural and commercial identity.I begin by surveying Bristol\u2019s Wine Street and its inhabitants and contexts. This section provides a historiographical review of the category \u2018middling\u2019 and articulates its usefulness in describing prominent residents on such a culturally vibrant urban street. I also set out here how \u2018play\u2019 is a useful methodological lens when approaching non-elite urban activity, drawing on primary sources from Bristol and building on other case-studies of early modern performance, creativity and social status. The notion of commercial middling play leads into the article\u2019s second section, which centres on the Wine Street playhouse. I revise our understanding of the venue and its proprietors, offer new evidence for its physical structure, and characterise playhouse-management as a paradigm of urban middling activity. In doing so, I look beyond what has to date been a sole focus on the playhouse\u2019s male proprietor, Nicholas Woolfe, in order to approach the venue with his wife and co-proprietor, Margaret, and his son, Miles, in mind. When read together, the Woolfe family\u2019s probate material, attendant court cases, and the playhouse\u2019s Wine Street contexts present a picture of commercial play that is more complex than mere business opportunity. This section accordingly argues for a distinctly middling appetite for combining commercial and political interests with ostensibly \u2018elite\u2019 musical knowledge, family legacy, civic and community benefaction, and a vaguer but crucial \u2018artistic\u2019 conviction. I also show how women were key actors and leaders in such middling cultural activity, while recognising the gender dynamics\u2014exemplified by the Woolfe marriage\u2014that made their social status and autonomy precarious.In the article\u2019s third section, I extend this notion of middling play to the playhouse\u2019s neighbourhood, focusing on inns and goldsmiths\u2019 shops. Both these locations, as the case-studies here reveal, linked leisure and cultural activity with social and political advancement. This section presents a snapshot of an urban middling network that was to an extent dependent on local leisure sites, and shows how the composition of a particular street could support middling individuals in negotiating parish and civic hierarchies. What emerges from this micro-study of Wine Street is a discrete urban locale, related to but distinct from the parish, that was especially well placed to facilitate social and economic opportunities and creative development. The fourth and final section reflects on these findings and considers the broader lessons that can be learned from this case-study, underscoring the value of play to social status and identity across the early modern period.In many ways, the social opportunities available to the residents of Wine Street were thanks to its location at the heart of Bristol, a rapidly expanding port settlement that was to replace Norwich as England\u2019s second city in around 1700.[CITATION-3] In 1600, the population is estimated to have been around 12,000.[CITATION-4] This was considerably less than London\u2019s 200,000 inhabitants but equal to York\u2019s and only 3,000 shy of Norwich. Bristol is therefore a key site for exploring urban development (and playhouses) outside of the capital. The city was also characterised by a substantial number of freemen, which Jonathan Barry estimates at about 20 per cent of the population, or half of Bristol\u2019s adult men.[CITATION-5] Indeed, while Bristol was ruled by an oligarchical elite of, for the most part, merchants, Barry emphasises the \u2018large middle ground of masters, apprentices, and journeymen\u2019 who, despite occupying lower offices, formed a substantial and politically important demographic.[CITATION-6] Although the city was largely defined by the authority of what David Harris Sacks terms its \u2018merchant capital\u2019, which developed rapidly during the early modern period and was central to the specific developments of its \u2018social and political order\u2019, the burgeoning of other forms of commerce and wealth creation also gave power to those who sat beneath them in the social and financial hierarchy.[CITATION-7] Moreover, Bristol\u2019s enactment of Poor Laws and their consequences resulted in clear divisions of social status related to taxation; an order from June 1605 used subsidy records to make the less well-off\u2014those who fell below subsidy assessment\u2014undertake manual labour within their parishes to mend the highways (and so actively and visibly \u2018perform\u2019 their lower status).[CITATION-8] This encoding of status emphasised the distance of those with middling means from those who were obliged to perform this duty.Barry\u2019s extensive work on Bristol has shown how these non-merchant-elite middling individuals were sustained and commissioned by the city\u2019s wealthy patrons: \u2018the merchant elite of 1600 were investing heavily in rich furnishings and plate, and they were more likely than others to possess pictures and musical instruments\u2019. Moreover, \u2018many of these cultural items were produced by local craftsmen, and reflected local tastes and methods\u2019.[CITATION-9] The residents of Wine Street were therefore involved in two senses in the aesthetic developments of Bristol\u2019s material culture: they were the local craftsmen identified here by Barry\u2014cutlers, instrument-makers and goldsmiths\u2014but, as this article demonstrates, these non-elite figures also owned and engaged with pictures and musical instruments. Reading Wine Street as a coherent middling community can, in line with Barry\u2019s approach, undermine assumptions about exclusively \u2018elite\u2019 engagement with such cultural items.The city\u2019s architecture, like its social fabric, was also shifting. Its centre was increasingly subdivided into small tenancies (with a number of leases held by the corporation), and houses had undergone major structural shifts\u2014by about 1600, \u2018investment had \u2026 been made in the building of houses of three storeys across the city\u2019.[CITATION-10] In turn, some central areas of the city underwent a process of \u2018gentrification\u2019; by the mid-sixteenth century, when \u2018overseas merchants, rich retailers such as grocers, mercers, and drapers, and small shopkeepers such as shoemakers and tailors dominated the city\u2019s center\u2019, these larger two- or three-storey shops in central Bristol were inhabited largely by those who \u2018were not poor, but nor were they members of the ruling or merchant elite\u2019.[CITATION-11] The combination of administrative reform, increasingly visible degrees of economic status, and architectural and residential shifts demarcates an era of major social change in the century following 1550 and marks an especially fertile period for Bristol\u2019s middling inhabitants.As with any micro-historical study, however, there are gaps in the evidence that make it impossible to comprehend entirely the cultural experiences of the individuals in focus. We do not know, for instance, the titles of the books that these goldsmiths, cutlers or instrument-makers owned or read, the exact nature of the plays that were on offer in Wine Street, or the materials that any of these residents may have written themselves: no account book, broadside or pamphlet survives that can be tied to any of these individuals. Barry offers some context, however, for the literary experiences of these men and women; he observes that the book trade grew in size from the 1630s but that throughout the whole period Bristol\u2019s inhabitants could buy printed matter from \u2018petty chapmen and hawkers in the streets, from grocers and other shopkeepers, and from the London booksellers who had stalls at the two annual fairs\u2019.[CITATION-12] In the 1620s, one Roger Royden, a bookseller, was active on Wine Street.[CITATION-13] I am less confident in Barry\u2019s suggestion that shorter material would have been more appropriate for these shopkeepers, who \u2018could hardly concentrate on long and complex arguments\u2019 due to their long and busy hours.[CITATION-14] Indeed, Bristol founded a library in 1613 aimed precisely at this demographic, with books donated by the Bristol-born bishop Tobias Mathew \u2018for the use of the Aldermen and Shop-keepers\u2019.[CITATION-15] Later catalogue work shows that this collection included \u2018a similar selection of books to those required by the students at Christ Church [Oxford]: a mixture of Church history, patristic texts, medieval writings, and classical works\u2019 alongside bibles, histories, polemics and sermons.[CITATION-16] We must therefore keep open the possibility that, on top of the rich network of play discussed here, there were abundant opportunities for many of these individuals to encounter a whole range of texts. More specifically, thanks to a handful of inventories and wills, to a variety of court cases (local and national), and to civic, guild and parish records, traces\u2014and sometimes telling anecdotes\u2014about those in the neighbourhood survive. The element of chance in the survival of cultural details\u2014particularly those that record \u2018playing\u2019 activities such as performance, carding or bowling\u2014can easily skew or limit our appreciation of individuals and communities. Yet there are, thankfully, an array (if by no means a thorough list) of such details for the area in question, which enable concrete connections between spaces and people and encourage informed speculation about what it was like to live, work and play (sometimes all at once) on early seventeenth-century Wine Street. In addition to textual material, the houses including and surrounding Nicholas Woolfe\u2019s playhouse can be understood in some depth thanks to surviving leases and plans and to Roger Leech\u2019s meticulous reconstruction work.[CITATION-17] Using this material, it is possible to focus in on the sites central to this study: numbers 6, 7, and 8 Christ Church\u2013Wine Street\u2014three properties that extended from the south wall of Christ Church, which stood at the corner of Wine Street and Broad Street\u2014the meal market at the end of the street, and the surrounding inns. The three numbered tenements were owned and leased out by the church, and in the years covered by this article, Number 6 was occupied by the goldsmith Richard Harsell (from at least 1583), and then by his son Edward, Number 7 by the cutler Nicholas Woolfe (also from at least 1583), and Number 8 by the goldsmith Humphrey Clovell (from at least 1589). Numbers 6 and 7 Wine Street are recorded in a sale of 1588/9 to the feoffees of Christ Church, William Yate, Humphrey Andrewes and Thomas Faukett, in an indenture that describes the two properties\u2014\u2018those two Tenementes with Thappurtenances scytuate lyinge and beinge in the said Cytye of Bristoll in a streate there Comenly called Winestreate\u2019\u2014 and names the occupants: \u2018Richard Harssell gouldsmythe and Nicholas wolfe Cutler\u2019.[CITATION-18] These buildings, sitting at the entrance to Wine Street, were connected through their occupants to surrounding commercial institutions such as the White Hart inn and the meal market, with its annual goldsmiths\u2019 standings. Indeed, the neighbours who occupied and surrounded these three key properties included the abovementioned Humphrey Clovell and Richard and Edward Harsell, prominent goldsmiths whose goods epitomised south-west metalwork of the period; Henry Yate, a soapmaker who went on to become mayor of Bristol (1631) and who bought and leased swathes of property across the city centre and at one point had charge of the playhouse; and Isacke Bryan, an instrument-maker whose family were resident in the vicinity of Wine Street\u2019s local parish church, Christ Church.As indicated above, these individuals fall into the broad category of the \u2018middling sort\u2019\u2014a term employed by a historiographical tradition that seeks to understand the changes experienced by those above dependent status but \u2018beneath\u2019 (in contemporary expression) the landed gentry or titled nobility.[CITATION-19] Leech\u2019s description of steadily renovated Wine Street houses and shops and the greater number of possessions detectable in inventories of their residents\u2019 belongings, in combination with the evidence introduced in the rest of this study, place the Woolfes and their neighbours squarely in this category. They were members of a group that experienced across the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries an \u2018improvement in living standards\u2019, a (gradual) growth in consumption alongside an \u2018increased emphasis on domesticity and the adoption of more genteel lifestyles\u2019, and a material culture \u2018richer in every sense than their social inferiors\u2019 with concomitant \u2018material and aesthetic domestic distinctions\u2019.[CITATION-20] All the individuals in Wine Street under discussion here\u2014chiefly in the middle to later stages of their lives\u2014needed to work to uphold and develop such standards of living and had to engage actively in their communities both socially and politically. They therefore, as we shall see, took minor roles in public office, such as churchwarden, or had responsibilities within the city corporation.[CITATION-21] Wine Street residents were thus well placed within a network of Bristol citizens of moderate to high moral and political standing; they exemplify Muldrew\u2019s conception of the early modern middling sort as those for whom such status was a \u2018process of continual achievement\u2019 through which individuals strove continuously to \u2018maintain access to the circulation of credit\u2019.[CITATION-22] The properties 6, 7 and 8 Christ Church\u2013Wine Street were also focal spaces that conjoined public institutions and professional and domestic lives. The Woolfe playhouse was part of a larger tenement that was rented out for accommodation and other purposes to a range of individuals, and the Woolfes themselves lived (presumably in Nicholas\u2019s cutler \u2018shop\u2019) on the same street.[CITATION-23] Inventories from Wine Street\u2019s goldsmiths demonstrate that they too lived and worked, as was usual for the period, in the same property.[CITATION-24] The neighbourhood therefore encapsulates not only the social aspects of middling identity but its imbrication with household space. Indeed, Tara Hamling and Catherine Richardson have crucially noted how domestic surroundings shaped economic and social status, pointing to a middling demographic marked out by \u2018the quality of their decorated and furnished spaces \u2026 the number of goods they owned and the diversity of their material and form\u2019.[CITATION-25] The information on Wine Street brought together in this article, from household inventories to inn receipts, helps us to understand how the community-facing expressions of Bristolian middling activity combined with the lives of working households in the city\u2014in both their characteristically \u2018multifunctional houses and spaces\u2019 and the concomitant \u2018penetration of work and leisure, domestic and commercial production\u2019 described by Hamling and Richardson.[CITATION-26] These broader social changes were evident among the middling inhabitants of Wine Street from the mid- to the late sixteenth century, and, as I have noted, they thus represent an earlier example of middlingness than those found in many studies, which concentrate on the mid-seventeenth century and later.[CITATION-27] Wine Street also allows us to examine the growth of commercial activity among this newly better-off sort of people. Carole Shammas has noted that \u2018there seems to have been a sharp rise in the real amount of wealth put into consumer goods between the end of the sixteenth century and the later seventeenth century\u2019, and Lorna Weatherill observes that, as a result of this increase, \u2018some in the middle ranks had distinctly consumerist tastes and a need to assert their position in society in subtle ways\u2019.[CITATION-28] Wine Street\u2019s residents and visitors provide an early example of the way in which commercial districts delimited and shaped acts of consumption and spending. The location\u2019s attractiveness to visitors interested in such luxury goods as metalwork places it within the long history of shopping laid out by Bruno Blond\u00e9, Peter Stabel, Jon Stobart and Ilja Van Damme, acknowledging the complexity of retail spaces and the growth of \u2018specialist retail areas\u2019 in pre-modern towns.[CITATION-29] In Wine Street, the sale of high-end or luxury items was spatially related to a burgeoning commercialised \u2018play\u2019 industry selling services, and thus provides valuable insight into the consumer tastes of those in the middle ranks of Elizabethan and Jacobean society.[CITATION-30] This study of Bristol\u2019s Wine Street thus moves away from the \u2018middling\u2019 village life studied by Keith Wrightson and David Levine, and from Henry French\u2019s predominantly agrarian-adjacent townspeople. It speaks more closely to Phil Withington\u2019s narrative about those urban environments that developed out of the \u2018material opportunities of dissolution\u2019 and steady \u2018cultural refashioning\u2019\u2014of manners, taste, behaviour, and political and legal structures\u2014that would eventually start to distinguish a prosperous and \u2018polite\u2019 middling sort from an ostensibly lower, \u2018plebeian\u2019 culture.[CITATION-31] Peter Earle\u2019s observations about post-1660 London therefore apply equally well to the vibrant trading economy of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Bristol: \u2018the growth of towns \u2026 the expansion of inland and foreign trade, of industry and the professions, had rapidly increased the numbers of those belonging to the urban middle station and made a nonsense of systems of social classifications based on a purely rural and agricultural society\u2019.[CITATION-32] An alternative term to fit the individuals under discussion here would be Richard Grassby\u2019s label, \u2018business community\u2019, drawn from a study in which he likewise links economic examination with social and cultural analysis in exploring non-aristocratic groupings. However, alongside the possible anachronism in the term, Grassby\u2019s definition of \u2018business\u2019 excludes the non-elite commerce that took place at Wine Street: he defines \u2018business\u2019 people as those who traded goods \u2018full-time,\u2019 held \u00a3500 equity, and possessed \u00a31,000 working capital.[CITATION-33] In contrast, an approach to these \u2018middling\u2019 individuals that acknowledges their specific urban environments is significantly more appropriate for exploring social status in early seventeenth-century Bristol, for four chief reasons. Firstly, it includes those, like the Woolfes, who represent a distinctly different form of business management, one not in goods but in \u2018play\u2019 (or, more broadly, the service industry). Secondly, it acknowledges that ownership and status were manifested in ways other than equity and capital\u2014running key community spaces such as inns, managing innovative industries such as playhouses, or owning hubs of cultural and economic exchange such as goldsmiths\u2019 shops. In the third place, it recognises multiple occupations held simultaneously (being a practising cutler and running a playhouse), and, finally, it accommodates female business management and middling status by looking outside formal ownership or capital assessment. This approach also helps push back against Grassby\u2019s suggestion that those in the business community merely mimicked the cultural interests of aristocrats above them in the social order, rather than developing their own aesthetic identities\u2014a viewpoint roundly rejected by the cultural analysis here and by other recent studies.[CITATION-34] Wine Street\u2019s early seventeenth-century playhouse and its surroundings therefore offer a chance to approach both the socio-economic and the cultural activities of this community of men and women on their own terms and to consider their status through their lived experience.is therefore central to the sections that follow, which demonstrate how commercial aesthetic pursuits shaped middling identities. Jessica Winston has surveyed the significance of \u2018literary play\u2019 for London lawyers in the mid-sixteenth century, arguing that it was \u2018not simply an aspect of social life\u2019 but a form that \u2018helped to raise the status of early modern legal men and the common law\u2019.[CITATION-35] I follow Winston\u2019s sense of the enabling social possibilities of play, even as I move away from literary specificity and the \u2018culture of letters\u2019 associated with the legal inns to accommodate a broader notion of play, as it applies to a group of non-\u2018professionals\u2019: to a community of cutlers, goldsmiths, soapmakers, instrument-makers, and widows.[CITATION-36] These individuals were bound not by institution, occupation or literary culture but by proximity and shared commercial sites, by the sense of \u2018play\u2019rather than on the page. Jennifer Bishop\u2019s and Mireille Galinou\u2019s work therefore offers parallels, thanks to their understanding of how the artistic and literary activities of traders and merchants were central to social and political identities.[CITATION-37] Their studies have shown how staged drama and humanist forms of leisure linked trade with \u2018legitimate political action\u2019 and wider questions of social identity in a developing urban environment.[CITATION-38] \u2018Play\u2019 in its broadest sense, as the remainder of the article demonstrates, underwrote middling identity and activity in the fast-developing locale of Wine Street.Playhouse proprietors who were actively engaged in their civic communities exemplify how middling commercial activity was imbricated in the type of wider cultural identity-making recognised by Winston, Bishop and Galinou. For instance, George Tadlowe, a London haberdasher in the 1540s, was assessed only at a moderate \u00a330 and \u00a340 in goods in his lifetime,[CITATION-39] yet Bishop has demonstrated how this man was prominently involved in \u2018the institutions of civic government\u2019 while also engaging widely with London\u2019s literary scene. Indeed, Bishop\u2019s exploration of Tadlowe locates his \u2018economic, social, and political status\u2019 in wider engagement with humanist activities and his work as a \u2018cultural patron\u2019 (culminating in his sponsorship of Thomas More\u2019sin its English translation).[CITATION-40] Like Nicholas Woolfe, Tadlowe hosted plays in his dwelling house and tavern, the White Horse, which David Kathman identifies as an early example of a venue for commercial playing in England.[CITATION-41] He might therefore be styled as a Haberdasher at Play, in Winston\u2019s formulation, uniting the various elements of his business life, civic office and cultural experimentation in service of his political and social career. Although less prominent in the literary and political records, Woolfe is a strikingly similar figure, and thanks to comparatively detailed information about his life (in large part due to his surviving will) and his property on Wine Street, we can understand in greater depth how and why a man of moderate means might invest in dramatic playing: not solely due to business opportunism but from a combination of commercial interest, charitable and community engagement, social and political networking, and musical or artistic interest.Studies of the Woolfes\u2019 Wine Street playhouse have fallen almost entirely under the purview of theatre history, and even there it has had only cursory attention. Since the publication of the few records testifying to its existence in Mark Pilkington\u2019s Bristol edition of, Siobhan Keenan has completed an up-to-date summary of the establishment and its possible performances, while Sarah Elizabeth Lowe\u2019s doctoral research examined it in the context of players and performances in the early modern south-west.[CITATION-42] John Astington has begun to point to the wider commercial vibrancy of Wine Street in an article that looks at \u2018feats of activity\u2019 (a phrase used for tumbling or acrobatics) performed in a venue known as the Rose in the 1630s;[CITATION-43] but no such contextual work has yet been done for the period when Bristol\u2019s earliest known playhouse was in operation.What we do know is that in 1589 Nicholas Woolfe requested permission to enlarge his tenement in Wine Street, and that by 1604/5 a property belonging to Nicholas Woolfe had begun to host players performing for a paying public, putting up \u2018certaine Comedyantes whome he suffered to act and playe within the said Roomes\u2019 for which both he and his wife Margaret \u2018tooke moneye\u2019\u2014all in the tenement identified by a complainant in a legal quarrel, Richard Cooke, as a \u2018Common Inne\u2019.[CITATION-44] The precise location of this property remains up for debate. Margaret Woolfe testified that her husband held only his dwelling place and \u2018one house with thappurtenances in wyne streete within the same citie comonlie called the playehouse\u2019.[CITATION-45] Her testimony distinguishes the playhouse from the known, named inns of the area, and she also does not \u2018name\u2019 the place by a sign or any other distinguishing title or feature beyond \u2018playehouse\u2019; her phrasing indicates that the venue was popularly known by this word\u2014which would be in keeping with Laurie Johnson\u2019s speculation about the naming of the Newington Butts theatre in Southwark.[CITATION-46] I thus concur with Keenan, Leech and Lowe in concluding that the likeliest spot is the tenement at number 7 Christ Church\u2013Wine Street, recorded as being in Woolfe\u2019s hands, the lease of which permitted him to \u2018to New buylde the said Tenemente and everye parte thereof with thappurtenances within foure yeares nexte ensuinge the date hereof\u2019, and included permission for \u2018the rearinge up higher\u2019 of the tenement.[CITATION-47] Keenan is cautious about the exact plans or description of the playhouse, but by drawing on the details provided in the relevant legal cases, alongside comparable London examples, we can arrive at a plausible understanding of the space\u2019s functions. Keenan points to the considerable \u2018number of chambers\u2019 described in testimony, while noting that the description of the tenement as a \u2018dwelling house\u2019 in later leases \u2018does not preclude its earlier use as the playhouse\u2019.[CITATION-48] Indeed, the very term playhouse indicates not only the flexibility of the term \u2018play\u2019 but of the term \u2018house\u2019, which held a more capacious definition than \u2018a freestanding structure\u2019. Andy Kesson observes how \u2018\u201chouse\u201d could refer to a space, indoor or outdoor, and not simply an individual building\u2019.[CITATION-49] As such, \u2018playhouse\u2019 could well have indicated a particular room or rooms within Woolfe\u2019s tenement, and Cooke, complaining of the \u2018woulfish intentes\u2019 of the Woolfes, observed that players performed \u2018within the said Roomes\u2019.Cooke\u2019s phrasing echoes earlier Common Council legislation about playing in London, which aims to restrict those \u2018repayring or Coming to \u2026 houses vnder the pretence or Coullor of hering or eyeng of eny such Interlude or play to enter into eny Chamber or other Close or secrete place within \u2026 houses duryng the tyme of ye seid play\u2019.[CITATION-50] Indeed, room-based playing can be traced in the more \u2018canonical\u2019 playhouses of Elizabethan London, not least in Richard Farrant\u2019s successful plan to \u2018pull downe one perticion and so make of too rooms one\u2019 to create the first playhouse at the Blackfriars in 1576.[CITATION-51] The \u2018playhouse\u2019 at Wine Street may therefore have been a parallel space to the \u2018close\u2019 chambers and indoor room-conversions of early modern London.[CITATION-52] It clearly occupied, like Farrant\u2019s space, a part of a larger building, with a main entrance off Wine Street itself. Woolfe explained how the property said to host the comedians had \u2018very many Roomes\u2019, with only one \u2018vtter streete doore \u2026 which is but one and the onlie way into all the whole howse\u2019 and used \u2018in Common betweene\u2019 occupants \u2018for their seuerall entries into their seuerall and respective partes of the said whole howse\u2019.[CITATION-53] We can thus achieve a fuller picture of the Woolfe playhouse set-up that situates it at the intersection between domestic interior and the commercial streetlife of central Bristol; it demonstrates its status as a house of multiple occupancy that contemporaries associated with an \u2018inn\u2019, but in which performance and performers cohabited with other residents.Although by profession Nicholas Woolfe was (like his nephew Isaac) a cutler, Cooke described him repeatedly in court as an \u2018innholder\u2019.[CITATION-54] Pilkington observes that he owned the White Hart and Lamb inns, \u2018yet chose to house his playhouse within rooms of a third property rather than in one of his own innyards (assuming they had yards). Clearly the notion of the innyard as a performance space did not capture Woolfe\u2019s imagination\u2019.[CITATION-55] We have seen, however, that the property in which the playhouse was located was itself referred to as a \u2018Common Inne\u2019, and the assumed distinctions between these tenements may well be misleading: there is no reason to expect inns to host performances in outside yards, especially given that London Corporation material shows how such properties frequently housed performance in \u2018close\u2019 rooms and chambers, in exactly the fashion described by Cooke. Moreover, the White Hart inn only came to Nicholas Woolfe following his marriage to Margaret. Woolfe\u2019s desire to open a venue in a series of rooms that would come to be known as the \u2018playehouse\u2019 therefore fits with his existing properties on and around Wine Street, situating it as part of a commercial portfolio of inns, shops, and various rooms for rent:, in the most elastic early modern sense of that term.In turn, Margaret Woolfe\u2019s White Hart inn and Margaret herself are overlooked parts of the playhouse\u2019s narrative. Pilkington and Keenan have largely framed the playhouse as a one-man operation, but the contextual legal materials show the importance of Margaret to the interconnected commercial network around Christ Church. She married Nicholas in February 1605 following the death of her previous husband, Thomas Thomas, from whom she inherited significant amounts of \u2018plate\u2019 and \u2018one mesuage tenement or Inne within the Citty of Bristoll called the signe of the White Harte & sondrye other houses landes tenementes\u2019.[CITATION-56] Margaret continued to manage the White Hart herself \u2018to her greate profit and comoditie\u2019 for some time until Nicholas entreated her to move in with him. While the Wine Street playhouse was possibly already in operation by the time Margaret brought the White Hart into the marriage, the important conjunction of personal and business collaboration in their union points to a network of overlapping, neighbouring business operations on and around Wine Street that mirror the relationship between the Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch.[CITATION-57] Richard Cooke\u2019s testimony also explicitly identifies Margaret as the co-owner of and co-profiter from the playhouse itself, observing that he handed money for room rent directly to Margaret andto Nicholas (a legal nicety emphasised in the suit) and that\u2018the defendantes tooke money\u2019 from comedians performing in the rooms.[CITATION-58] Margaret\u2019s financial capital going into the marriage and her management skills illustrate how middling status can be ascribed to women in spheres beyond independent widowhood or domestic production and consumption, and how the \u2018middling\u2019 marriage was often a coming together of individuals who had recognition in the community combined with property and goods. Margaret Woolfe therefore adds to the list of women at the centre of the developing urban leisure industries of early modern England.[CITATION-59] The Woolfes\u2019 motivation for operating a multipurpose tenement that featured a \u2018stage\u2019 has been little explored beyond assumptions about financial reasons.[CITATION-60] However, a consideration of the broader social place of such individuals and their operations moves us beyond a reductive economic explanation and shows, rather, how commercial incentives combined with middling cultural tastes. Certainly, there were financial incentives to open a playhouse in the bustling port city of Bristol for those with the means, connections and status to do so. Sally-Beth MacLean points out how much of a \u2018lure\u2019 Bristol was \u2018for entertainers on tour\u2019, noting the \u2018size and relative affluence of the potential audience for performance\u2019, which \u2018probably persuaded troupes to stay for longer and return more often to Bristol than to other locations in the region\u2019.[CITATION-61] Indeed, performances are recorded at the Guildhall in Bristol for most decades of the sixteenth century, but after 1598 there is no explicit mention of the location where visiting players performed, prompting speculation that the Woolfe playhouse acted as an alternative venue.[CITATION-62] Such performances are typically recorded as being \u2018for\u2019 the mayor and aldermen; one particular audit entry from 1587 indicates more fully who might have comprised an audience, recording a fee for the Lord of Leicester\u2019s players \u2018who plaied in the yelde hall before them and others of the Common Counsell with divers Citizens\u2019.[CITATION-63] The entry indicates an elite and middling audience who may well also have been the primary visitors to Wine Street\u2019s various commercial operations. Indeed, the playhouse may even have made these civic performances redundant. MacLean\u2019s survey of the south-west identifies a gradual decline in payments to players, taking the south-western circuit from one of the most profitable to \u2018one of the least rewarding in the seventeenth century\u2019.[CITATION-64] The privatisation of performance through commercial venues such as the Woolfes\u2019 may have resulted in the decline of public payments recorded in town audits; the playhouse presented a commercial performance space that, while initially working alongside civic performance, could clearly operate free from any direct ties to City authority. While Bristol\u2019s civic payments to troupes did indeed decline in the seventeenth century, the playhouse continued to generate enough revenue to supply local charities with benefactions until 1625.[CITATION-65] Bristol also has a broader history of play in this period, equally appealing to the \u2018middling\u2019 members of society who participated in and ran different types of entertainment. Keenan has argued that there is \u2018a strong possibility\u2019 that a children\u2019s company, founded with royal assent in 1615 under the authority of John Daniel (the poet Samuel Daniel\u2019s brother), performed at the playhouse.[CITATION-66] That such a company was based in Bristol suggests that there were regular venues for performance, and the Woolfe playhouse is among the likeliest spots for the company to have fulfilled their licence to \u2018shewe and exercise publiquely to their best commoditie aswell in and about our said Citie of Bristoll in such vsuall houses as themselves shall provide, as in other convenient places\u2019.[CITATION-67] Beyond \u2018Comedies histories Enterludes morrallPastorallStageplayes\u2019 and other dramatic performances, however, other forms of play were accessible in surrounding areas. The marsh was home to regular bearbaiting performances with similar audiences to those for travelling players; throughout the 1570s the Lord of Leicester\u2019s bearward was rewarded for \u2018shewing pastyme with his Beares before Mr Mayer and the Aldremen in the marshe\u2019.[CITATION-68] The marsh was a location for archery practice, and John Robert, mayor in 1579, commissioned \u2018a pair of short Buttes to be made\u2019 there in 1579. By 1588 the audits record repairs to a \u2018butthouse\u2019 on the site, and by 1619 there was also a \u2018shooteing house in the marshe\u2019, perhaps signifying the archery site or perhaps a gunpowder-based equivalent.[CITATION-69] The marsh was also home to a range of play-ful activities, including a bowling green, and pageant constructions for distinguished visitors, such as \u2018the vast mock sea and land battles provided for the entertainment of Elizabeth I in 1574 and Queen Anne in 1614\u2019.[CITATION-70] Central Bristol, like London, was home to numerous bowling alleys, and individuals such as Thomas Yewyns were charged in the diocesan court for keeping \u2018nyne hole playing every Sabbothe daye \u2026 in Mr Seymors courte\u2019.[CITATION-71] Samuel Clovell, quite possibly the brother of Wine Street\u2019s Humphrey, was similarly charged \u2018ffor bowlinge at service and sermon tyme \u2026 in their owne parishe\u2019 of St Nicholas.[CITATION-72] Wine Street was a parallel but distinct recreational destination to the marsh or to such urban bowling alleys, which, like their London equivalents, most likely provided a range of different activities within their bounds for a range of different visitors. The audiences of mayor, aldermen and \u2018divers Citizens\u2019 recorded at the performances of visiting players to the city suggest that it was only a particularly middling and elite set of people who had access to dramatic play in Bristol.[CITATION-73] While the term \u2018citizens\u2019 does not give a great deal of information on demographics, it at the very least implies those free of the city (and hence not, for instance, apprentices or young women). However, as with spaces like St Paul\u2019s playhouse in London (about whose audience we know very little), there is the possibility of a more popular audience for the Wine Street playhouse itself; like the Woolfe playhouse, St Paul\u2019s was a reasonably small indoor space, yet Reavley Gair speculates (on the basis of evidence in Richard Bancroft\u2019s visitation report from 1598) that entry could have been as relatively affordable as two pence.[CITATION-74] Moreover, a later playbill from the 1630s advertises \u2018rare Activityes of bodye\u2019 by boys, girls and others performed at the \u2018the rose in in winestreet []\u2019 to a generalised public.[CITATION-75] The bill raises questions about the different types of \u2018play\u2019 and the kinds of players who may have performed at Woolfe\u2019s earlier venue, perhaps aligning it with multi-purpose spaces such as London\u2019s Theatre or Curtain or the rooms at the Bel Savage or Bull, all of which hosted fencing and improvisational clowning alongside \u2018interludes\u2019 and \u2018comedies\u2019.While the exact types of play on offer at the playhouse remain largely a matter of speculation, the space\u2014and Wine Street itself\u2014can be more closely associated with musical performance. To date, scholars have emphasised Nicholas Woolfe\u2019s apparent lack of theatrical connections.[CITATION-76] The lawsuits following his death make it clear, however, that he had some investment in music and musical instruments. Among the belongings that his son Miles inherited from his father\u2019s Wine Street leisure portfolio were \u2018two paire of virginalles\u2019, which Miles used while being taught for two years \u2018in the Arte or science of musicke\u2019.[CITATION-77] This small detail suggests that more was at stake in Woolfe\u2019s playhouse interests than mere financial opportunism. Indeed, Christopher Marsh has commented that \u2018evidence of music lessons in the middling ranks of society is difficult to find\u2019, but that such absence does not reflect \u2018a genuine lack of provision\u2019, and noted various examples of non-gentry individuals engaged in musical tuition.[CITATION-78] Such tuition was sought for children for multiple reasons, including personal enjoyment, as a sign of cultivation, and in conjunction with contemporary advice to the gentry about good breeding and humanist virtue. The virginal was an instrument particularly associated with the gentry, but, as with other forms of supposedly aristocratic musical culture, it also became popular among the middling sort. Marsh observes, for instance, that Bristol had a particularly high level of ownership of virginals among non-gentry and tradespeople.[CITATION-79] Nicholas and Miles Woolfe provide evidence not only of their possession but of training in the art of music.Nicholas practised his trade of cutler and trained apprentices up to his death (after which his nephew Isaac took over his final apprentice, John Sutchecombe).[CITATION-80] As a practising cutler but also a playhouse proprietor and innholder, Nicholas\u2019s interest in music demonstrates a conflation of personal and professional investment in the instrument. Such instruments may also have been a feature of the playhouse and its recreational surroundings. Despite the superior status of virginals and related musical instruments, they were not only available in halls or manor houses: \u2018there were numerous instances in which the instruments of the \u201cbetter sort\u201d were heard at theatres, inns, alehouses, marketplaces, churches, cathedrals and other places not associated exclusively with the gentry\u2019.[CITATION-81] Bristol had a particularly large number of professional instrument-makers, and resident in the parish of Christ Church in these years was the family of one Isacke Bryan\u2014a \u2018virginall maker\u2019 made free of the city in 1609 in a special act of redemption by the City corporation.[CITATION-82] The parish accounts record Bryan living close to Wine Street (in Duke Lane, where Humphrey Clovell the goldsmith held the lease on a garden near the Old Market).[CITATION-83] The rising prosperity of Bristol\u2019s middling sort in these years may well have increased the market for such instruments beyond the local gentry.Miles\u2019s inheritance from his father included not only playhouse, property, instruments, and various items of plate, but a network of cultural associations and experiences that put playing\u2014musical, dramatic, or otherwise\u2014at the centre of his world. His father entrusted to two overseers\u2014his \u2018good friendes\u2019 the Wine Street soapmaker and alderman Henry Yate and Joseph Rattle\u2014his property and his son\u2019s upbringing, while simultaneously emphasising the centrality of the playhouse to his life and legacy.[CITATION-84] Woolfe\u2019s relationship with Yate reveals the link between a Wine Street cutler and an alderman who would go on to become mayor of the city. Connections such as these, through and beyond the parish, explored in more detail in the later part of this article, doubtless helped set up the playhouse as a key destination for a corporation looking for a venue for visiting players, and perhaps helped to ingratiate the Woolfes and their enterprise with the political elite. Indeed, Nicholas\u2019s will provides a fascinating insight into middling attitudes towards cultural activity beyond trade and craft and suggests a more complicated approach to the status of play that goes beyond the purely commercial, while also indicating the political climate that allowed a playhouse to thrive in the neighbourhood for some twenty years.Nicholas Woolfe left charitable bequests to the poor of St Peter\u2019s, to the Company of Cutlers and Smiths \u2018for the maintenance of their hall\u2019, to the poor parishioners of Bristol\u2019s Newgate jail, to poor relief for the children of the city hospital, and to the almshouses of St John\u2019s and of St Michael\u2019s\u2014all \u2018payable out of my \u2026 Playhouse\u2019 and, crucially, conditional upon its theatrical continuance:Provided always \u2026 soe longe only as the same house shall continewe a playe house at that such players as doe resorte to the said Cittie or inhabite within the same doe vsually playe there and may be permitted and suffered quietly to playe there\u2026[CITATION-85] Not only does this phrasing confirm the notion that both visiting and resident troupes or \u2018players\u2019 performed there, but among the will\u2019s principal stipulations was the preservation of \u2018play\u2019 within the house. Woolfe used the legacy of the playhouse to bring together his craft status (with money set aside for the cutlers), his role within the community in providing bequests for a range of charitable institutions, and his commitment to play performance both because of and beyond its commercial value. This suggests a pride in the playhouse itself that transcends purely financial motivation. The bequest of his entire property portfolio and lands to his son, Miles, further connects the lawsuit concerning Miles\u2019s rights, upbringing and inheritance to the playhouse itself, and helps connect Miles\u2019s education to Nicholas\u2019s intentions for the future safety of the playhouse. Miles is shown in the Christ Church parish records as being briefly in occupation of the Wine Street property before his untimely death in 1620, and through and beyond these years up to 1625 the property continued to pay revenues relating to Nicholas\u2019s charitable bequests, thereby confirming its continued operation as a playhouse.[CITATION-86] While middling status was preserved for Miles (even if he did have to go through a court battle to wrest control away from his guardians and reassert his rights), Nicholas\u2019s widow Margaret was less well served (Miles being Nicholas\u2019s son from a previous marriage). Margaret\u2019s previous widowhood had left her with financial agency and an important place in the community, as the proprietor of the White Hart inn. Woolfe\u2019s will, however, distributed even the property she brought into the marriage (he allegedly made a deed of gift of her chattels, which was then immediately sold back to him) and bequeathed all his remaining goods to his other family, not leaving (in the words of her nephew Christopher Whitson in Chancery) to \u2018Margrett one penny in goodes or other wise sauinge onlie houseroome during her life insoemuch as shee became very poore and miserable and was enforsed to crave relief of others\u2019.[CITATION-87] Margaret herself testified in Miles Woolfe\u2019s lawsuit that during their marriage her husband \u2018carried himselfe so harde and greedie vpon this defendantes meanes and estate\u2019, even though \u2018he were welthie and of good estate\u2019.[CITATION-88] Margaret\u2019s treatment provides a stark reminder that expressions of middling identity through culture (via plays, music, or dress and other forms of visible status and consumption) were deeply gendered\u2014with Margaret painting an especially miserly picture of her late husband in terms of particular (female) forms of consumption.[CITATION-89] Margaret\u2019s wealth, status and appearance were contingent on her new husband\u2019s financial management, and the materials she brought into the marriage\u2014in spite of Woolfe having \u2018promised to leaue her the said Margrett in better estate then he marryed her yf he fortuned to dye before her\u2019\u2014were immediately repossessed asmiddling property through a devious deed of gift. The playhouse served to benefit the charities in receipt of Nicholas\u2019s bequest, Miles and his overseers, and players performing there, but it provided no legacy for Margaret despite her instrumental place in the operation.Inheritance is therefore a crucial part of the story of the Wine Street playhouse in the early seventeenth century. Nicholas Woolfe\u2019s bequests and requests\u2014both charitable and familial\u2014mark him as a man whose financial and cultural agency enabled him to enshrine \u2018play\u2019, in its elastic early modern sense, at the heart of both his local community and his son\u2019s education, while withholding any benefit from his wife. Hamling and Richardson have observed how \u2018patterns of bequeathal at death indicate strategies for the purchase, apportionment and distinction between goods, worked out in detail over a considerable length of time, as an explicit part of the establishment of familial status through household things\u2019.[CITATION-90] Woolfe\u2019s sense of respectable, planned and profitable play suggests that these observations can be extended from the domestic sphere to wider commercial and recreational concerns, positioning \u2018play\u2019 as an expression of middling identity in this particular urban environment\u2014one that perhaps sat at odds with other, domestic, expressions of identity, from Woolfe\u2019s wife\u2019s clothing to his matrimonial duties.Middling involvement in urban play was not limited to the commercial playhouse; it was, rather, a more fundamental feature of neighbourhood experience, trade and personal interaction. The links between play and social identity extended in Wine Street to the goldsmith\u2019s shop and the inn, and in turn to the complex layers of property ownership associated with these sites. These prominent locations within the neighbourhood were places where professional skill and commercial success intersected with political agency to form a particularly \u2018middling\u2019 community. Moreover, these overlaps show that Bristol\u2019s commercial playing scene developed out of the cultural, political and financial opportunities available to a group of local residents.The goldsmiths\u2019 shop and the inn were key elements of urban social status, community and enterprise. Withington has shown how urban inns, taverns and alehouses were \u2018inextricable from modern rituals of consumption and company among the wider populace\u2019, and Karen Newman\u2019s work suggests that goldsmiths\u2019 shops might, like the playhouse or the drinking venue, act as a key site for the intersection of material, sexual, cultural and economic exchange and the promise of social mobility.[CITATION-91] Indeed, Withington\u2019s approach to urban social history provides a blueprint for understanding how a \u2018moderately prosperous milieu\u2019 (like the geographically concentrated middling community examined here) might align \u2018companies\u2019 in drinking spaces or goldsmiths\u2019 shops with business matters and civic advancement.[CITATION-92] These places united with the playhouse to sharpen and shape social identity. Such observations are confirmed by examining the property ownership and rental structures relating to the inns and surrounding buildings, and by considering the ways they link Wine Street proprietors with parish and civic authorities.Sixteenth-century London offers useful analogues to Wine Street when mapping out the relationship between playhouses and neighbouring locations where recreational spending (of time, money and cultural capital) took place. The two earliest successful long-term commercial children\u2019s playing venues in London\u2014the First Blackfriars playhouse and St Paul\u2019s\u2014were similarly embedded in entertainment districts that promised visitors a multitude of recreational offerings. Henry Chettle explained in 1593 that \u2018While Plays are used, half the day is by most youths that have liberty spent upon them, or at least the greatest company drawn to the places where they frequent\u2019.[CITATION-93] That is to say, young people often hung out in the broader precinct or place surrounding a playhouse. Indeed, from the 1550s into the following century the Blackfriars was home to tennis courts, dancing and fencing schools, and high-end artisanal goods and European technologies.[CITATION-94] St Paul\u2019s, too, offered abundant cultural activities, from touring the damaged steeple of the cathedral to other forms of commercialised leisure; in Thomas Dekker\u2019s words (from 1609, but reflecting on the wider history of the area), one could dally in \u2018Sempsters shops, the new Tobacco-office, or amongst the Booke-sellers\u2019, and he informed potential visitors that \u2018there you may spend your legs \u2026 a whole after-noone: conuerse, plot, laugh, and talke any thing\u2019.[CITATION-95] Dekker\u2019s \u2018spend your legs\u2019 conflates walking on the street with spending money, indicating perfectly how areas like Blackfriars and St Paul\u2019s brought together recreational pastimes such as browsing, gossiping, shopping and playing within a delimited, and commercialised, urban locale. Wine Street provides a valuable example of an area where one might \u2018spend one\u2019s legs\u2019 outside of London, representing a similar development of urban space: the street demonstrates how middling craftspeople transformed a neighbourhood into an area for commercial, consumerist play, and in turn for the negotiation of social, cultural and economic capital.The first example of such activity lies in goldsmiths\u2019 craft, interaction, and selling. Neighbouring the Wine Street playhouse on either side were the goldsmiths Humphrey Clovell and Richard Harsell (and thereafter Edward his son, also a goldsmith). Harsell was a member of a small dynasty of Bristolian goldsmiths: he became a burgess in 1580 and trained at least three apprentices. Richard himself had been trained by James Insall, who had moved to Christ Church parish by 1592, and Richard in turn trained his own sons, Edward and Robert junior. The elder Harsell\u2019s work survives, recognisable from the maidenhead with quatrefoil mark and his name, R HARSELL, on some surviving work, including pewter spoons.[CITATION-96] Humphrey Clovell was trained by another prominent goldsmith of the area, Paul Freling, and in turn is known, according to Timothy Kent, for training the \u2018prolific goldsmith family of Corsleys\u2019\u2014a major producer of south-western metalwork in the seventeenth century. Indeed, his apprentice, John Corsley, became his son-in-law in 1592, and once he had received his freedom of the city, he seemingly leaned on Clovell and his Wine Street shop and residence. A Chancery case from 1606, after Corsley had been married to Clovell\u2019s daughter for nearly fifteen years, found him \u2018lyinge in Pryson in Newgate in London vpon sundry accounts of debt\u2019. According to the defendant William Walton, Corsley was freed upon significant loans that he then neglected to pay back, instead running to \u2018go and laie in the North partes of this lande where this defendente should not touch him\u2019. When Corsley stayed in Bristol, Walton believed he \u2018lived \u2026 vnder his ffather in lawe Mr Clovell goldsmith\u2019.[CITATION-97] Given the continued careers of the Corsley family, his connections with Clovell cannot have done him any harm, even during this period of debt and avoidance.Clovell\u2019s probate inventory, taken at his death in 1627 by his neighbour (next-door-but-one) and fellow goldsmith, Edward Harsell, helps us reconstruct his property\u2019s layout and its belongings. For Leech, Clovell\u2019s goods perfectly encapsulate the life of a reasonably well-to-do goldsmith who was \u2018not part of the city\u2019s elite\u2019; his house, moreover, had an open hall that had not yet been ceiled\u2014another indication, for Leech, of his distance from elite status.[CITATION-98] Nonetheless, his considerable range of personal possessions and domestic items firmly situate Clovell as a middling resident of the city: he owned various stools, cushions, carpets, cooking equipment, a Bible and a chronicle, and \u2018wainescott, stayne clothes & pictures about the hall\u2019\u2014a key marker of middling domestic interiors, indicating further engagement with consumer culture.[CITATION-99] Moreover, his shop was fixed in (presumably the front of) the property, containing at his death numerous instruments and fixtures relating to his trade.The place of Clovell\u2019s well-furnished if structurally old-fashioned residence and shop within the centre of the city in Wine Street informs our understanding of his place in Bristol culture beyond the limited details available through inventory evidence. For instance, Clovell not only knew Harsell well enough for the latter\u2019s son, Edward (who occupied his father\u2019s property on Wine Street in the 1620s) to produce his inventory, but also knew his direct neighbour Woolfe well enough to stand for him in the diocesan court over the cryptic matter of \u2018abusing the channel\u2019.[CITATION-100] The Harsells\u2019 workshop also points to further interpersonal connections between Bristol\u2019s goldsmith trade and the Woolfe playhouse; it is possible that the Thomas Thomas apprenticed to Richard Harsell in 1580 was the same Thomas Thomas who was the first husband of Margaret Woolfe. The trade of goldsmithery in Bristol can therefore help define and texture our understanding of middling urban experiences beyond the immediate craft itself. The growing network of individuals plying their trades here expanded beyond local limitations, too, particularly for goldsmiths: in the mid-1570s, Bristol corporation had converted some of the space further down the street into a meal market, which was adapted and let out each year as \u2018standings\u2019 for goldsmiths from all over the country during St James\u2019s fair. The standings were a substantial piece of civic infrastructure, requiring regular spending each year.[CITATION-101] The location of the Harsell and Clovell shops thus connected them to senior figures of the London-managed goldsmith network that help us contextualise and appreciate Clovell\u2019s seemingly modest property and inventory.The success of the goldsmiths on Wine Street and its probable reputation as a destination where one could buy anything from gilt rings to bowls and spoons (as found at Clovell\u2019s stand in 1599)[CITATION-102] suggest that the area was a key urban shopping location\u2014with corresponding advantages for the location of a playhouse. Blond\u00e9, Stabel, Stobart and Van Damme have noted how \u2018each street had its own micro-geography of retail spaces\u2019, which \u2018reflected the place-specific development of retail circuits and spaces, and gave each street its own particular character\u2019.[CITATION-103] Scholars have characterised the areas around London playhouses in similar terms, particularly those venues in \u2018exempt\u2019 areas outside Corporation jurisdiction, such as St Paul\u2019s and Blackfriars. Mary Bly\u2019s work on London\u2019s liberties, for instance, recognises the combination of material, ideological and human forces that \u2018shaped each liberty into a unique space in the early modern imagination\u2019; Sarah Dustagheer observes how city drama \u2018developed in relation to the specific playhouse locations in which it was performed\u2019.[CITATION-104] These observations can be extended to Wine Street, which brought together a distinctive retail environment with an area for play. The goldsmiths\u2019 shops and standings added to the leisurely character of the area, providing a mixture of practical and high-end goods. Derek Keene noted how \u2018from sixteenth-century London there is good evidence for the pleasure that wealthy and cultivated men and women gained from shopping in person\u2019, and Claire Walsh has shown how shopping was a \u2018multi-faceted activity\u2019 that interrelated \u2018with other aspects of social and business life\u2019.[CITATION-105] Indeed, the wider significance of the goldsmiths\u2019 outputs, in particular rings and spoons, situate Wine Street as a retail centre of cross-cultural significance for middling individuals and part of the nexus of social and cultural exchange identified by Karen Newman.[CITATION-106] Not only did such shops offer, on occasion, high-end metalwork, they also allow us to capture what Beverley Lemire has recognised as the \u2018multi-purpose uses of \u2026 metals\u2019, which had \u2018complex functions\u2019 and sometimes \u2018convoluted routes of exchange\u2019.[CITATION-107] Specific examples of metallic exchanges can be pinpointed in Bristol. The city\u2019s soapmakers, for instance, began in the seventeenth century to put rings down as deposits or forfeits for their observance of pricing agreements. In 1612, members agreed on a price to which they \u2018sete \u2026 handes and Possites\u2019, including Humphrey Reade\u2019s (of Christ Church parish) signet ring; in 1615, Henry Yate of Wine Street (the soapmaker and overseer and witness the previous year of Nicholas Woolfe\u2019s will) simply laid down \u00a33 6\u2018in gould\u2019.[CITATION-108] Tracking the varied circulation of metalwork in this way suggests a broader cultural role for material objects such as jewels, and in turn shows how the outputs of craftspeople like the Harsells and Clovell issued into a community where jewellery\u2019s practical and decorative uses combined to furnish men and women of the town with status symbols that represented a combination of social, cultural and economic currency.The circulation of goldsmiths\u2019 goods was not restricted to their crafted outputs, but extended to the property relations between individuals, revealing how tradespeople, including the possible goldsmith Thomas Thomas and the cutler Nicholas Woolfe, occupied positions as innholders at the same time as they pursued their craft. Such innholders held a crucial position in parish life, not only because their establishments represented places for the middling sort to drink, eat and socialise and where visitors could stay, but because they were sites where political administration and conviviality united. These were sites in which recreational drinking (or what Withington would term the \u2018culture of intoxication\u2019) helped determine and negotiate \u2018civic patronage, income, and regulatory power\u2019.[CITATION-109] A look at the intersections between socialising, parish organisation, and more elite civic participation demonstrates how the playhouse, and Wine Street more broadly, was well situated to host visiting players to the city and to act as a useful meeting point for those with political agency.Inns as well as taverns were drinking establishments for the better off, with alehouses serving the least well off in society. The lines between them, however, were porous, as Mark Hailwood\u2019s study of the alehouse makes clear.[CITATION-110] Indeed, the various statuses of the drinking establishments central to the parish life of Christ Church are not entirely certain: the White Hart, for instance, was a subdivided tenement.[CITATION-111] The location of the Rose, the most frequented venue in the parish records, is also uncertain and so is its exact status or function. Nonetheless, these venues brought together the individuals described above, from goldsmiths to cutlers to soapmakers.Humphrey Clovell (1590, 1595), Thomas Thomas (1594), and Henry Yate (1608, 1628) were all churchwardens of Christ Church. Alongside this group, another soapmaker, Humphrey Reade (whom we met above pawning a ring for business), was also churchwarden in 1611. A number of years are missing from the accounts in the early 1600s, leaving it open to speculation whether Nicholas Woolfe ever occupied such a position. Nonetheless, the surviving accounts record these Wine Street figures as present in the usual business of running the parish, including repairing the fabric of the church and steeple, managing and recording births, deaths, and marriages, and keeping the accounts themselves. French\u2019s focus on the parish as the focal point and generator of middling identity emphasises the role of such figures in \u2018the administrative reality of its government\u2019.[CITATION-112] Indeed, not only did the processing of poor relief inscribe both financial and moral authority on those managing the parish (and require financial overheads and outlays on the part of churchwardens), it also instituted a collective identity predicated on group socialisation: Thomas Thomas recorded 32spent at the Rose in 1594 \u2018beinge there about busyness of the churche\u2019, and in the following year Clovell spent 26there on the account day, illustrating how these public spaces combined administration and socialising. Thomas Thomas also recorded 10spent during his tenure at the White Hart\u2014his own inn (later part of the Woolfe portfolio)\u2014\u2018after the parishioners had walked the bounds of the parishe\u2019.[CITATION-113] These individuals tie together Wine Street\u2019s recreational spaces with local governance, social status and identity.Moreover, while individuals such as Clovell and Thomas concentrated their focus on the parish, they were joined by the likes of Abel Kitchen and John Woodwarde, who acted as churchwardens in the 1600s and were both city aldermen. Alderman Henry Yate, too, went on to become mayor in 1631, after his two stints as churchwarden. These figures connect the middling level administration of the parish with the political elites of the city, and the personal networks generated both through parish politics and through city life\u2014with Yate acting as overseer of Woolfe\u2019s will\u2014demonstrate how Wine Street helped facilitate social connections within and beyond the parish. Yate himself, according to Miles Woolfe, ran the playhouse, or at the very least administered its profits, in the years after Nicholas\u2019s death and during Miles\u2019s minority.[CITATION-114] Property on Wine Street itself represented a similar conjunction of city and parish identity. A great number of the tenements on Wine Street were owned by Bristol\u2019s corporation, and their yearly rental is recorded in the mayoral audits written up by the Chamberlain. The parish itself rented a number of these properties, including leases for five shops attached to Christ Church, for which it paid the city rent. Moreover, the parish owned a number of properties, including Woolfe\u2019s playhouse tenement, meaning that the street was largely split into leases issued by the city and leases issued by the parish.[CITATION-115] The playhouse property, along with Harsell\u2019s and Clovell\u2019s tenements, was sold in an indenture of 1588 by George Salterne to the feoffees, one of whom was Henry Yate\u2019s father, William (himself the possessor of a number of tenements and new-built properties on the street).[CITATION-116] The layered rentals and subleases that characterised the centre of the city and the overlapping parish and civic administration capture the complexity of Wine Street as a site of urban interaction between elite individuals and middling interests; regular civic spending on areas such as the Wine Street meal market \u2018that in the ffeyre the way mowght be large to go into the goldsmythes standinges\u2019 reveal the commercial investment of Bristol\u2019s political elite in the area.[CITATION-117] The street saw the attendance of mayors and aldermen at plays, their management of the street\u2019s rental and commercial potential, and the interaction between civic elites and local tradespeople such as Clovell, the Harsells and the Woolfes. This paints a picture of a porous middling identity, bound up with the various iterations of political and administrative power both enacted by and enacted upon its residents.In the Wine Street neighbourhood, then, middling status extended into the upper echelons of urban politics, where aldermen like the soapmaker Henry Yate could own several tenements and temporarily manage a playhouse. But it also encompassed individuals like Clovell, a goldsmith living in and working out of his tenement, but active in his vibrant local community and closely connected with the street\u2019s recreational operations. It further illustrates the contingent status of middling identity for widows such as Margaret Thomas/Woolfe. The Chamberlain\u2019s audits record numerous widows leasing property on Wine Street for some years, and we have seen how Margaret herself managed the White Hart inn. The area therefore encapsulates varying middling expressions of identity across different areas of life, from politics to commerce to play, these factors coming together to create a place of especially concentrated urban middling opportunity.The divide between elite, middling and popular cultures is rarely clear-cut, and Marsh and Hailwood have illustrated how these three ostensibly distinct categories frequently overlapped. The playhouse on Wine Street represents a perfect example of a space founded on middling capital and connections that fostered such overlaps, catering to Bristol\u2019s mayors and aldermen while offering public performances. This study of that space and its contexts has explored the processes involved in constructing and running such a theatrical venue, particularly outside of London, in order to determine the social, financial and aesthetic factors that made such a venture viable.The bustling, commodity-filled, merchant-led port city of Bristol is by no means representative when it comes to assessing either playhouse management or middling status in England more broadly. Yet this focus on Wine Street has presented some important lessons for understanding the cultural lives of middling people in urban spaces, both methodologically and materially. Such a case-study necessitates recognising how those with the requisite credit\u2014financial and social\u2014negotiated and collaborated across one stretch of a city street. These wider contexts of the playhouse reveal a particular middling cultural expression at work across various institutions, from the inn to the goldsmith\u2019s shop. It was in this very particular location that people of modest to considerable means, with degrees of local and civic authority, connected across the realms of politics, property and play to foster a retail location for middle to high-end offerings and a vibrant leisure industry.That the commercial, cultural and political lives of these individuals were closely related and fundamentally shaped their social status is perhaps not surprising, as past studies of the middling sort have shown. However, centring on connected forms of play within a small geographical concentration opens up a new way to understand what a holistic \u2018cultural\u2019 approach can mean for enquiries into social status. Usingas a lens helps to shift the focus of analysis away from the statistics or the archival details of individuals, households or businesses towards their shared, communal, multipurpose sites of activity. Situating the Woolfes as middling archetypes in this way demonstrates how commercial play accommodated female business management (albeit within other lifestyle confines) and accounts for the place of artistic or sentimental value in decisions about commerce, legacy and community. Beyond the cynicism (explicit or implicit) often ascribed to the subjects of status and identity-making studies\u2014particularly those that emphasise ambition or social mobility\u2014the Woolfes remind us that there were multiple, sometimes paradoxical, factors at work in the investment of time, money and emotion in social and cultural expression. Certainly, financial status is one defining factor that differentiates the middling sort from, say, those dependent upon poor relief. Likewise, administrative responsibility conferred status and authority upon those with the means and respectability to acquire positions of office. Yet Nicholas Woolfe complicates a predominantly financial and social picture of middling identity by placing a playhouse at the centre of his will. His emphasis on continued play at the theatre and his son\u2019s musical tuition on the virginals celebrate forms of cultural expression beyond business, even as they coincide with commercial success. His will and its controversies, along with his wife Margaret\u2019s complicated marital and business life, similarly point to the fluid boundaries of middling experience, particularly those generational and gender differences that cannot be separated from the lived experience of a male householder.This microhistory of Wine Street\u2019s leisure industry therefore provides a unique angle on the construction and expression of middling identity that looks beyond the parish as the defining boundary. French sees the parish as the \u2018power base, primary social resource, and central reference point for \u2018middling\u2019 identity\u2019,[CITATION-118] and while this article confirms its importance as an organising community even within the urban landscape, the more expansive consideration of related forms of cultural expression open up new points of reference. Individuals significant in the parish hierarchy connected lesser-middling citizens to the elite power base of the mayor and aldermen, many of whom worked and drank with Wine Street residents in local establishments. Moreover, taking the playhouse as the starting point for this enquiry into middling cultural identity situates it within the wider play-scape of Bristol, and therefore indicates how such a leisure venue brought together those interested in various forms of cultural \u2018play\u2019 beyond the bounds of the parish. Wine Street also brought together national expressions of the goldsmiths\u2019 trade within one market, meaning that particular south-western approaches to metalwork would sit side by side with goods produced by goldsmiths from London and other English areas. Wine Street therefore suggests one way in which early modern citizens might recognise a concentrated \u2018middling\u2019 community: a place to shop for medium- to high-end goods, engage in varied forms of play and music, and socialise with the political elite both from within the city and beyond. In this, the area presents similarities with London\u2019s own leisure hotspots, such as Blackfriars, St Paul\u2019s, or Shoreditch: it was to these vibrant commercial hubs, featuring playhouses, that individuals flocked to spend their legs, time, and money.Finally, this study helps to refine our understanding of \u2018playhouses\u2019 more broadly. Explorations such as Keenan\u2019s have emphasised the provincial nature of Bristol\u2019s Woolfe playhouse, marking it as an \u2018innovative\u2019 outlier.[CITATION-119] Yet it aligns with the playhouses familiar in London from the 1540s and 1550s. By looking beyond direct references to dramatic activity, and considering the wider information about the tenement supplied in court cases, I have explored the similarity of the playhouse to converted spaces in London, like Farrant\u2019s Blackfriars, or the city inns, such as the Bel Savage, Bull, Bell, Cross Keys, or Boar\u2019s Head. These parallels not only make sense of the multi-room nature of the building, which provided accommodation as well as playing space for comedians, but also make more plausible its multifunctional nature as a play-space, resonating with the playbill advertising feats of activity in a different venue on the street in the 1630s. Such an understanding allows a greater appreciation of the diversity of playing places available in and beyond London that fall under the flexible term \u2018playhouse\u2019\u2014both syllables of which are especially fluid early modern words. Like London playing spaces, it remains possible that the Woolfe playhouse catered to a diverse audience, bringing civic performances before the mayor and aldermen while simultaneously advertising public play for which Margaret and Nicholas \u2018tooke moneye\u2019.[CITATION-120] Wine Street bears witness to those processes often characterised as signs of an emergent middling sort or even a middle class\u2014increased consumption, recreational shopping, and emerging ideas of gentility. These are usually identified as later seventeenth-century phenomena, but this study shows that they were prevalent from at least the 1570s in Bristol, where they reached a point of particular development by the 1600s. The Wine Street \u2018middling\u2019 leisure industry provides a useful lens for analysing how goldsmiths, cutlers, soapmakers, instrument-makers and inn-holding widows, with various degrees of local political and financial agency, helped a neighbourhood develop into a commercial recreational destination for diverse visitors. The behaviour of these individuals indicates how specifically-ful cultural activity, combined with commercial retailing and services, though often driven by non-financial motivations, supplied key markers of middling identity and social status in the period.",
