Czechoslovakia obtained the industrially developed and strategically important part, which had a large Polish and German population. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the minority policy of the Czechoslovak state administration by focusing on the examples of state-run railway employees and workers in large, mostly private, industrial establishments. It discusses the mechanisms of an ethnic policy that functioned in a particular, distinctive region at the crossroads of three cultures\u2014German, Polish and Czech. Policies towards minorities in Czechoslovakia in the period before the Munich Agreement of 1938 have often been regarded as democratic and tolerant. Nonetheless, the integration of Cieszyn Silesia was a significant challenge for Czechoslovak authorities and their actions were often in contradiction with liberal principles. This paper focuses not on the legislation, but on the practical approaches that contributed to the enhancement of the position of the Czech nation. In the case of both railwaymen and industrial workers, the state authorities took action that had a common goal\u2014the Czechification of the region. The main difference in methods used against both groups depended on the direct dependence of the former (railwaymen) on the state as their employer. In the case of industrial workers, state policies had a less direct impact, but nonetheless created conditions conducive to discriminatory and assimilationist pressures.Among the central and east European countries established after the First World War, the First Czechoslovak Republic has a prominent place as the country which succeeded in maintaining its democracy for twenty continuous years until the catastrophic year of 1938, when it collapsed following the Munich Agreement. The legislation of Czechoslovakia was striking thanks to its liberal attitude to ethnic minorities. Not only did the Republic sign the Minority Treaties, as did other newly formed countries in the region, but its constitution also included regulations protecting ethnic minorities and banning discrimination and denationalisation. Minorities could run schools at different levels using their own language of instruction. They also enjoyed the right to form numerous associations and political parties, and to maintain their mother tongue. Nonetheless, the actual practice of the state administration led to patterns of behaviour which advantaged members of the national majority and which had the aim of marginalising ethnic minorities.[CITATION-1] The purpose of this article is to present the actions taken by the state administration against railwaymen and industrial workers who belonged to the Polish and German minorities in Czechoslovak Cieszyn Silesia. It is a case-study which discusses the mechanisms of an ethnic policy that functioned in a particular, distinctive region set at the crossroads of three cultures\u2014Polish, German and Czech. The situation in this province provides a good example of various forms of ethnic discrimination and different attitudes towards local Germans and Poles, which undermines the idealised image of the Czechoslovak state\u2019s liberal policy. The categories of workers selected for analysis are particularly important, given the industrial character and developed transport network of the region. Although existing historiography has sometimes mentioned the economic difficulties that these two groups faced, these pressures have not been the subject of detailed research.Most existing scholarship on Czechoslovak policy towards ethnic minorities has tended to point to its liberal and democratic features, even though some shortcomings have been acknowledged.[CITATION-2] More critical have been academics from outside the Czech Republic.[CITATION-3] Tara Zahra and Pieter Judson have written about efforts to place Czech officials in ethnically mixed regions in order to reinforce the Czech nation, improve the election results of Czech parties and support Czech schools.[CITATION-4] Zahra noted that \u2018Czech nationalists moreover continued to portray themselves as a victimized minority in their own nation-state\u2019.[CITATION-5] Judson has referred to the \u2018victor\u2019s language of victimization\u2019.[CITATION-6] This outlook had initially been formed at the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when the Czech national movement gradually strengthened its position by competing with a dominant German culture. Czech historians dealing with economic nationalism (Jan H\u00e1jek, Eduard Kub\u016f, Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160ou\u0161a and others) understand this attitude as one that supported and favoured the representatives of one national group in economic life.[CITATION-7] They acknowledge that after the establishment of an independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, state institutions which were theoretically neutral in fact regulated policy in order to strengthen the economic position of the nation state. They point to land reform and the nostrification of industry as examples where such activity occurred.[CITATION-8] But, after the consolidation of the new state\u2019s economy and the establishment of new Czech elites, Czech economic nationalism is then said to have weakened, while it is claimed that in the 1930s the economic nationalism of the German minority became stronger.[CITATION-9] This particular approach acknowledges that nostrification had nationalistic features, but suggests that its goals were primarily economic and fiscal. The group and individual interests of business circles, Czech companies and shareholders may have been decisive, but financial companies belonging to the German minority and Czech\u2013German consortia also participated in this process.[CITATION-10] A similar opinion has been expressed by Christoph Boyer, who notes that although the Czech political mainstream during the First Republic was anti-German, this did not translate into a comprehensive and consistent political programme. Measures were taken to push Germans out of management positions in private companies, but there was no master plan to ruin the Germans. Highly qualified specialists were difficult to replace and the legal system did not allow arbitrary actions against private business.[CITATION-11] Uwe M\u00fcller, on the other hand, has argued that \u2018the scope of economic policy is frequently underestimated particularly in the case of Czechoslovakia. The reference to the liberal character of the policy is unconvincing in this context, since Czech leaders also established in the cases of nostrification and agrarian protection illiberal priorities\u2019.[CITATION-12] The economic pressures on national minorities is a subject which has been disregarded by most researchers.[CITATION-13] Some historians have, however, mentioned complaints of oppression which were expressed by contemporary nationalist associations, although these were never upheld when examined by the state authorities.[CITATION-14] Tara Zahra has interpreted inter-war economic oppression primarily in terms of the propaganda produced by nationalist groups rather than considering the degree to which individuals and communities were free to determine their own nationality.[CITATION-15] Her view corresponds with the opinion of Pavel Kladiwa, Andrea Pokludov\u00e1 and Renata Kafkov\u00e1 (using an example from the earlier Austro-Hungarian period) that workers with no developed national consciousness often took on the attitudes of their employer completely voluntarily: \u2018The unconscious assumption of a different identity, the purely opportunistic approach and the submission to the will of the employer under coercion by material reasons intersect here\u2019.[CITATION-16] In a similar way, Jakub R\u00e1kosn\u00edk has regarded the rhetoric of economic nationalism formulated by those workers who were fired as being essentially utilitarian. In this context, he discusses Josef Chmel\u00e1\u0159\u2019s opinion from 1935, which referred to the complaints of the Polish minority from Cieszyn Silesia. Chmel\u00e1\u0159 claimed that Polish workers who had been made redundant posed as victims of oppression because of their nationality or sought support from a \u2018majority national orientation\u2019 (although he does not specify what this means, an issue which will be discussed later).[CITATION-17] The issue of ethnic policy in Cieszyn Silesia has been raised mostly by Polish historians, who mention the relocation of Polish railwaymen to other regions and the dismissal of, and discrimination against, Polish workers, pointing out that those who sent their children to Czech schools and joined Czech associations avoided repression.[CITATION-18] In this context, Jaroslav Valenta, a Czech historian, has acknowledged that among Poles who remembered the inter-war period, the memory of economic oppression was widespread. However, his conclusion was that while \u2018elements of the alleged \u201cCzechification\u201d were certainly present in various forms \u2026 I do not think that they were overwhelming and decisive, and definitely not an official state policy\u2019.[CITATION-19] Striking a more nuanced note, Dan Gawrecki has conceded that the local administration was certainly less tolerant towards national minorities than the central authorities.[CITATION-20] He also highlights the transfer of Polish railwaymen in 1935\u20136.[CITATION-21] Emanuel R\u00e1dl (a philosopher active during the First Republic) mentioned the reduction of railway staff of German nationality in the Bohemian Lands.[CITATION-22] More recently, I myself have investigated the issue of the transfer of railwaymen from Cieszyn Silesia for ethnic reasons.[CITATION-23] Contemporary documents drafted by officials concerning Czech ethnic policy in this area have also been studied.[CITATION-24] This article, based on a case-study of policy regarding railwaymen and industrial workers, aims to show that the Czechoslovak state administration at various levels, to a much greater extent than previously thought, took action against national minorities, at least in the region of Cieszyn Silesia. It also shows that the application of different methods against these two groups pursued the same goal: the Czechification of the region. The mechanisms discussed below were practised elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. This is particularly true of territories whose affiliation after Great War was the subject of conflicts between newly formed nation states.The analysis is underpinned by research in the archives of the Presidium of the Ministerial Council, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Entrepreneurship, Ministry for Public Works, Ministry of Social Welfare (all in the National Archive in Prague); the Mining Inspectorate in Brno (Moravian Provincial Archive, Brno);association (Opava Provincial Archives); the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Central Archives of Modern Records in Warsaw); and also the Archive of the President\u2019s Office in Prague and the Archive of Czech Railways in \u010cervenka. Published memoirs were also consulted. Reminiscences about discrimination against railwaymen and workers were recorded in interviews with contemporary witnesses, conducted by the author within a project pursued by the KARTA Centre, a Warsaw NGO.[CITATION-25] Officially, the Czechoslovak, not the Czech, nation was the one that constituted the state in the First Republic.[CITATION-26] Nevertheless, for its members living in the Bohemian Lands, the term \u2018Czechs\u2019 was used most often by contemporaries. This article will also use the term \u2018Czechs\u2019, as the number of Slovaks in Cieszyn Silesia was small during the First Republic.Cieszyn Silesia\u2019s ethnic composition was an outcome of its complicated history. It was originally ruled by one of the many lines of the Polish Piast dynasty (which died out in 1653), but in the fourteenth century it became a fiefdom of the Kingdom of Bohemia. In the sixteenth century, together with this kingdom, it was incorporated into the Habsburg empire. The Polish national movement was active in the region from the 1840s. It was first created by intellectuals of peasant origin and later supported by workers and elites originating from groups such as these, and thus was not based on the chivalric code which dominated the Polish culture of this period. By the end of the nineteenth century, a Czech national movement had also been established in the western part of the region. Its main protagonists were immigrant industrialists and engineers who encountered a wave of Polish immigrant workers from Galicia, whose own sense of nationality was weak. The third biggest ethnic group was made up of Germans, who formed a majority in the cities and had established elites dominating local administration, education and the economy.[CITATION-27] After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of the First World War, Cieszyn Silesia became a matter of dispute between the newly formed states of Poland and Czechoslovakia. First, on 5 November 1918, the Czechand the Polish National Council of the Duchy of Cieszyn, each being a representative of local Czechs and Poles, agreed to divide the territory of Cieszyn Silesia temporarily between them, based on ethnic principles. As a result, the Polish side initially controlled the iron and steel works in T\u0159inec [Pol. Trzyniec], the eastern part of the Ostrava-Karvin\u00e1 Coal Basin, and a section of Ko\u0161ice\u2013Bohum\u00edn Railway, which joins the Bohemian Lands with Slovakia, which were all strategically important for the Czechs.In January 1919, Czechoslovak troops invaded territory administered by the Poles, which began an eight-day war with Poland. The Entente Powers forced an armistice, but the territorial dispute lasted for another year and a half. The planned plebiscite, preparations for which were accompanied by bilateral acts of violence, failed to take place and, instead, the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris announced a decision to divide Cieszyn Silesia between the two countries on 28 July 1920. Czechoslovakia thereby achieved all its strategic goals, and gained a sizeable Polish minority population which lived mostly in the districts of Fry\u0161t\u00e1t [Pol. Frysztat] and \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn [Pol. Czeski Cieszyn]. The westernmost Fr\u00fddek district was predominantly Czech.[CITATION-28] Cieszyn Silesia was therefore an example of one of many regions whose future was largely determined by economic arguments. Helga Schultz has pointed out that across eastern and central Europe \u2018in a world with strongly separating frontiers and high economic protectionism, it was necessary for the states to gain sovereignty of the communication network for trade and transport\u2019.[CITATION-29] However, this led to certain consequences. National minorities in areas acquired in this way were usually perceivedas a threat to the state. Minority leaders, in turn, sought support abroad, as the only permanent compromise with the incoming state authorities would have been to renounce their own identity. In this context, Rogers Brubaker uses the term \u2018external national homeland\u2019 and remarks that, during the inter-war period, central-eastern European countries claimed to be national states, yet in reality they were nationalising states, each of which felt \u2018responsible in some sense, not only for its own citizens, but also for ethnic co-nationals who live in other states and possess other citizenships\u2019.[CITATION-30] Notwithstanding that fact, these countries protested against external interference by those countries which felt it within their own rights to offer protection to their citizens.Czech authorities often realised the difficulty that full integration of the acquired lands into the Czechoslovak state entailed and tended to mistrust local populations. For this reason, in the first years after the acquisition, they introduced administrative boards in municipalities (Polish authorities, on their side of the frontier, acted likewise in an attempt to weaken German influence, especially in the cities) and postponed local elections: before holding elections, the state wanted first to strengthen the position of Czechs in each municipality by establishing Czech schools and societies.[CITATION-31] The Czechoslovak administration took slightly different approaches to the German and Polish minorities in Cieszyn Silesia, which were dependent on the different social standing of these groups. The policy towards Germans was also part of nationwide policy towards this minority, with the result that Cieszyn Silesia was not considered to have a specifically German problem. Indeed, the privileged German position was a remnant of their domination in Cieszyn Silesia during the Habsburg period. German had been the language of social advancement. The wealthier classes spoke German and used that language to manage their companies; they also supported German schools and organisations. Hence it made sense for a majority in the local community to consider assimilating into German culture as a condition of social advancement.The region was, on the other hand, home to a significant Polish minority located in close proximity to Poland, where feelings associated with historical defeat and interests in reviewing the borders were strong. The Polish minority was a well-organised, yet less wealthy community. The Czech discourse of the inter-war period (scientific, literary, journalistic) considered the Polish autochthonic population not as \u2018real\u2019 Poles, but as polonised \u2018Moravians\u2019 (and thus Czechs), who should be won over for the Czech nation.[CITATION-32] The local Polish population had strong regional features, shaped by the peasant roots of the national movement, religious diversity (most were Catholics, but as many as one-third were Lutherans)[CITATION-33] and the use of a local dialect in verbal communication. (Nowadays, Czech historians acknowledge that this dialect is undoubtedly Polish, both structurally and lexically.)[CITATION-34] Two drafts of the ethnic policy for Cieszyn Silesia were considered by the Czechoslovak government. The first was conceived by Rudolf Matou\u0161, a Czech delegate for the International Plebiscite Commission. The author of the other was Josef \u0160r\u00e1mek, Silesian provincial president in Opava. The first of these proposals, put forward by Matou\u0161 before the proclamation of the division of the region in July 1920, envisaged the \u2018degermanisation\u2019 and \u2018depolonisation\u2019 of mining and metallurgy, by employing solely Czechs in these industries, replacing German officials with Czechs, educating only Czechs at the mining school and putting pressure on factory owners to dismiss foreigners. Regarding the railways, he planned to establish a grand management of 600 staff in \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn, large-scale replacement of staff on the Ko\u0161ice\u2013Bohum\u00edn Railway, and employing only Czechs. While Matou\u0161\u2019s schemes were never fully adopted, they were the subject of an inter-ministerial meeting in Prague on 3 August 1920. The representative from the Ministry for Public Works announced that proposals for the implementation of the \u2018degermanisation\u2019 and \u2018depolonisation\u2019 of industry should be compiled. However, it is unknown if such proposals were ever actually formulated. An official from the Ministry of Railways certainly envisaged no significant staff modifications, but he announced the transfer of the management of the local railways to the directorate of Czechoslovak State Railways in Olomouc. He also added that Poles should have as little access as possible to higher positions.[CITATION-35] President \u0160r\u00e1mek\u2019s scheme, dating from August 1920, envisaged the Czechification of the region, but it did not include detailed suggestions for changes in industry and the railways. This issue, however, was discussed in his correspondence with central government agencies. In January 1923 he suggested that Cieszyn Silesia should be colonised with Czechs,[CITATION-36] and in February 1923 during an audience at the Office of the President of the Republic he stressed the need to employ \u2018local\u2019 workers as substitutes for dismissed Poles and Germans in Cieszyn Silesia.[CITATION-37] Neither of these two schemes was used as a basis for an official government policy towards Cieszyn Silesia, which does not mean, however, that the policy of shaping the ethnic mix of the region was abandoned. Naturally, government agencies had a stronger influence in sectors managed by the government, above all the railways. The most important railway line in Cieszyn Silesia, the local section of the Ko\u0161ice\u2013Bohum\u00edn Railway (, or), ran through areas where mostly Polish and German populations lived, and in many places was only a few dozen metres away from the Polish border, which meant that transport along this line could be easily disrupted during any potential conflict. The Ko\u0161ice\u2013Bohum\u00edn Railway was a private co-partnership based in Budapest. At the beginning of 1921, the directorate of Czechoslovak State Railways in Olomouc, which managed other railway lines in the region, took over the management of the Silesian section. The Ko\u0161ice\u2013Bohum\u00edn Railway remained a private company in name only; its headquarters would be transferred to Czechoslovakia in 1927.In May 1921, during a ministerial meeting in Prague, the director of the Czechoslovak State Railways in Olomouc suggested that the current personnel of the Ko\u0161ice\u2013Bohum\u00edn Railway be transferred to other regions of the country and replaced by more trustworthy Czech-speaking staff. It was then decided that four \u2018politically and ethnically trustworthy officials\u2019 would be sent to the Silesian section of the railway, and soon after that the posts of station-master at two main stations would be filled with \u2018trustworthy Czech people\u2019 by way of \u2018public contest\u2019.[CITATION-38] The Czech administration claimed that, during the Austrian monarchy, Czechs had been refused posts on the Ko\u0161ice\u2013Bohum\u00edn Railway, and even when Czechs were employed, they had been required to participate actively in nationalist German associations, such asor.[CITATION-39] Most of them had enrolled their children at German schools. The newly appointed railway executive in \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn mistrusted such Czechs, considering them opportunists and disparaging them for having married German women.[CITATION-40] Calls for competition for the posts of railway officials were prepared in such a way that they would ensure that people of Czech origin were successful. However, there was a shortage of well-qualified Czech staff. For instance, the competition process for the post of the chief of the maintenance section in August 1921 was unresolved: all the candidates were of German origin. In January 1923 the post was filled by Engineer Jan Letocha without any competition proceedings. His wife objected to moving to the alien environment of Cieszyn Silesia. Yet, despite her resistance, Letocha obeyed the decision of his superiors, because at that time there was a lack of candidates of Czech origin who were qualified to take on the post.[CITATION-41] Although the region where the Ko\u0161ice\u2013Bohum\u00edn Railway operated was inhabited mostly by Poles, they held only lower positions on the railway. In addition, according to Polish complaints in 1920 and 1921, 200 railwaymen of Polish nationality were expelled from Czechoslovakia.[CITATION-42] The press in the Polish sector of Cieszyn Silesia called in turn for the removal of Czech and German railwaymen. Thus, in August 1921, fifty-four railwaymen from this region, together with their families, were forced to leave Poland for Czechoslovakia, having rejected an official transfer that would have taken them deep into Poland. Most of them had not yet decided whether to opt for Czechoslovak or Polish citizenship. The same happened to another thirty-two or thirty-eight railwaymen in September 1921. Yet the Czech authorities refused to employ them, as most were of German nationality and, besides, there were no vacancies. Eventually, the Germans were accepted by Austria and engaged there, but six Czechs could not expect to find employment there. It was thus decided to transfer them to their hometowns in Czechoslovakia, where the municipal authorities were supposed to offer them help.[CITATION-43] In 1922, the Czech railway administration started preparations to transfer a significant number of railway staff from Cieszyn Silesia to other regions of the country (with no Polish schools and few, if any, German ones) in order to \u2018amend\u2019 the ethnic mix of the region. Previously, the project had been suspended as a result of an agreement with the Polish authorities concerning so called \u2018opters\u2019, that is, citizens who had an opportunity to opt for settling in the other country before 1922.[CITATION-44] Action against railwaymen of Polish and German nationality was demanded by Czech nationalist organisations, among them primarily(), which operated in this region and whose main aim was to develop a network of Czech schools.[CITATION-45] The conventional argument for transferring railwaymen out of the region was that there was an excess of local staff, yet despite that, in 1922, when at least forty railwaymen (among them twenty-nine Germans) were relocated from Cieszyn Silesia, twenty-one workers from other regions of the Czechoslovak Republic were brought in to replace them.[CITATION-46] The most significant scheme to transfer railwaymen of Polish and German nationality (and exceptionally Czech communists) was put into action in February 1923 and lasted until at least 1924. The list of workers to be transferred included 129 names (not all of whom were actually relocated).[CITATION-47] The scheme sparked protests among deputies of German nationality from the National Assembly and Polish diplomats. Poland\u2019s attempts to influence internal Czech affairs were shaped by the perception of the role of that a national state should play in East and Central Europe after the Great War. Although members of the Polish minority were Czechoslovak citizens, they regarded Poland as their true homeland and defender, especially in view of the fact that, until the elections of 1925, they had had no representation in the Czechoslovak National Assembly. On 17 February 1923, theof the Republic of Poland\u2019s legation in Prague, Karol Bader, handed a note concerning the situation of the railwaymen of Polish ethnicity to Edvard Bene\u0161, Czechoslovak Minister for Foreign Affairs. Bene\u0161 promised to \u2018persistently support\u2019 the issue, remarking that in personal matters \u2018any interference of a foreign state is legally and effectively unacceptable\u2019.[CITATION-48] None of these interventions by Polish diplomacy had any effect.The Czech administration never admitted that ethnic issues were a basis for the relocation of railwaymen. In February 1922, the Ministry of Railways offered assurances that transfers would take place for professional reasons only.[CITATION-49] In June 1922 Engineer Bohumil Reynek, the new railway executive in \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn, responded to accusations of using ethnic criteria to transfer railwayman by saying that \u2018they were justified by only professional reasons, and we never looked into the national views of any worker\u2019. This assertion stands in contradiction with his subsequent words that Poles \u2018are to the utmost degree members of a communist party, and they follow other principles than professional ones and thus their eviction from Silesia is amply justified and even necessary, should one take into consideration the interests of the state as a whole\u2019.[CITATION-50] The internal correspondence of the railway offices confirms that ethnic issues played the main role in the selection of workers to be relocated. \u2018Selection of untrustworthy elements (Polish terrorists and Germans) was always strictly based on a necessary impartiality\u2019 the Ministry of Railways noted in March 1923.[CITATION-51] The accusations of terrorism were connected with the fact that, during the conflict over Cieszyn Silesia, some residents had participated in clashes and joined combat groups on the Polish side, although according to the decision of the Conference of Ambassadors in 1920 nobody should have been punished for combat activity and participation in combat organisations during the conflict.[CITATION-52] Even activists of the Silesian People\u2019s Party, a faction of the Polish-speaking population which supported Czechoslovakia during the conflict of 1919\u201320, were among those transferred. In 1920, members of the party were appointed government commissioners in many municipalities. Many of them, however, contested the build-up of Czech influence and the development of a Czech school network.[CITATION-53] Typical arguments for transferring railwaymen were used in Augustyn Raszyk\u2019s case: \u2018Raszyk is a Pole, during the plebiscite he worked for the sake of Poland, and after the plebiscite he works against Czechs. He sends his four children to a Polish school in Darkov [Pol. Dark\u00f3w]. He influences his numerous relatives in Darkov, who support Polish schools. Revocation of his transfer would demoralise other relocated workers\u2019.[CITATION-54] The decision to relocate was cancelled if railwaymen had adopted a Czech national orientation, primarily by supporting the cause of Czech schools. A railway official, Josef La\u0161tovica, issued a positive assessment concerning a rail worker, Pawe\u0142 Cie\u015blar, who promoted Czech schools among \u2018unaware parents\u2019: \u2018Enrolment in Czech schools in Sibica resulted in 170 pupils, mainly from railwaymen families, which is astonishing as during the previous year\u2018s enrolment there were only eighteen children\u2019.[CITATION-55] This example shows that the effect of repression was not limited only to the people transferred, it also acted as intimidation against other members of the community, who decided to send their children to Czech schools to avoid trouble. One such was Jan Donocik from Jablunkov [Pol. Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w], who managed to avoid a transfer. Activists from the nationalist associationreported as follows: \u2018He was under influence of his relatives, who are rabid Poles. Since 1922, we have noticed a change in his behaviour\u2014he goes to Czech events and plays, sends his children to a Czech school and avoids anything Polish. Because his relatives were officially transferred, there is no worry he will act against us\u2019.[CITATION-56] The internal correspondence of the Railway confirms that actions against railwaymen were politically motivated. The director of Czechoslovak Railway in Olomouc, Viktor Pol\u00edvka, echoed La\u0161tovica\u2019s opinion in his letter to the Ministry of Railways: \u2018The town of \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn can be taken over by Czech parties provided that the staff of the local [railway] office voted for us. Considering the current national composition of the staff, it is impossible, which the last election clearly showed. I want to stress that at such an important time of elections even a loyal Pole will vote for Poles, and a loyal German will vote for Germans\u2014and never for us. Therefore, I believe that if we are to win a Czech majority in \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn, it is necessary to replace at least 70 per cent of the current staff of the local railway office\u2019.[CITATION-57] The situation was ameliorated at the turn of the 1920s and 1930s. Nationalist organisations warned that railwaymen had ceased to be intimidated, and some of them \u2018provocatively\u2019 moved their children from Czech to Polish schools. Those who were retired felt most unpunished: \u2018It is interesting that pensioners, if they have schoolchildren, having retired, send their children to a Polish school\u2019,[CITATION-58] noticedactivists, who regularly compiled lists of railwaymen considered disloyal because they actively participated in the social life of their minority.[CITATION-59] Notwithstanding that general pattern, single cases of relocation still occurred, as in the 1933 case of two railwaymen who, together with other Polish councillors, had supported communist candidates for the posts of the village mayor and his deputies in N\u011bmeck\u00e1 Lutyn\u011b [Pol. Niemiecka Lutynia].[CITATION-60] In 1934, when Poland signed a non-aggression pact with Germany, an anti-Czechoslovak campaign was launched in the Polish press. The campaign also included publicising examples of discrimination towards the Polish minority in Czechoslovakia and pleas for a revision of frontiers. Polish\u2013Czechoslovak relations deteriorated even more seriously in 1935, when the Second Department of the Chief of Staff of the Polish Army launched acts of sabotage in the Czechoslovak part of Cieszyn Silesia, such as destroying Czechoslovak state symbols, and breaking windows in Czech schools and Czech activists\u2019 houses. The action was meant to boost the morale of Poles living in Czechoslovakia, but in reality it sparked repression by the Czechoslovak authorities, who responded with another round of relocation of railwaymen.[CITATION-61] Information about the behaviour of railwaymen was mainly provided by nationalist organisations, such as, or, but also by the police and gendarmerie. Viktor Pol\u00edvka admitted that they managed to gather enough incriminating material against railwaymen in only three instances. The first of these three railwaymen had drunkenly sung the Polish anthem in an inn and, while he was on duty at a railway station, somebody drew graffiti with Polish texts and state symbols. The second allegedly made unfavourable comments about commemorative medals struck on the occasion of President Tom\u00e1\u0161 G. Masaryk\u2019s birthday. This railwayman was acquitted by the court of first instance, but the prosecution appealed. The third railwayman uttered a disrespectful sentence about fliers calling on the Polish minority to keep the peace.[CITATION-62] The number of railwaymen transferred from Cieszyn Silesia between 1935 and 1936 amounted to forty-three Germans and sixty-six Poles, according to Czechoslovak agencies.[CITATION-63] One reason for the transfers was to send a clear message to minorities so that they would avoid involvement in sabotage and anti-state actions, but, on the other hand, government agencies never admitted to having organised ethnically based repression and claimed the relocations were solely due to professional reasons.[CITATION-64] In relation to Germans, the suspicion of disloyalty was cast on members or camp followers of nationalist parties: the Sudeten Germans\u2019 Party and two parties which had been banned in 1933,and.[CITATION-65] With the rise of Adolf Hitler to power in Germany and the success of the radical nationalist Sudeten Germans\u2019 Party in the general election of 1935, Czechoslovak politicians began to realise that their international position was waning. In February 1937, Prime Minister Milan Hod\u017ea declared the need to amend policy towards ethnic minorities and admitted to having made mistakes in this respect.[CITATION-66] During a meeting with Karol Junga, a representative of the Polish minority in October 1937, he promised all relocated railwaymen could return to Cieszyn Silesia.[CITATION-67] As government offices officially denied the political motivation of transfers at the railway, some agencies, mainly the Provincial Government in Brno, advised putting return transfers into effect only gradually, to avoid conveying the impression of surrendering to minority pressure. During the following months, most of those who had been transferred elsewhere returned to Cieszyn Silesia.[CITATION-68] The options available to the state to pursue an assimilation policy in relation to industrial workers were different. With regard to industry, two government departments exercised responsibility: the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Entrepreneurship and the Ministry for Public Works. Other departments, such as the Presidium of the Ministerial Council, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of National Defence or the Ministry of Social Welfare, also expressed opinions. Yet their influence on private enterprises was indirect and their freedom to pursue ethnic policies was limited, as a majority of industrial plants were in private hands. According to one analysis submitted by Matou\u0161 in 1923, only four out of forty-five plants in the district of Fry\u0161t\u00e1t belonged to Czechs, in Fr\u00fddek only ten out of forty plants were in Czech hands, and in \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn only two plants out of forty. The majority of industry was owned by German nationals.[CITATION-69] Nevertheless, the Czechs\u2019 social standing was not as bad as it at first appears. According to data provided by an association of Czech engineers to Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159, the former prime minister of Czechoslovakia, among engineers and senior officials in mines and coking plants in the Ostrava-Karvin\u00e1 Coal Basin Czechs accounted for 59.8 per cent in 1896, 30.1 per cent in 1914, 36.4 per cent in 1921, and in 1922, 40.9 per cent. Germans comprised accordingly 33.9 per cent in 1896, 63.5 per cent in 1914, 61.2 per cent in 1921, and the following year 40.9 per cent. Other nationalities (mostly Poles) accounted for 6.3 per cent in 1896, 6.4 per cent in 1914, 2.4 per cent in 1921, and 2.2 per cent in 1922.[CITATION-70] This data shows that the number of German engineers and senior officials increased while the number of Czechs in those positions decreased before the Great War; after the region was incorporated into Czechoslovakia, the proportions reversed. The small number of Polish engineers and senior officers in companies decreased even further after 1920.The main measure to strengthen the influence of Czechs in industry was so-called \u2018nostrification\u2019, enacted on 11 December 1919. The Act granted the government powers to demand that foreign partnerships which operated subsidiaries in Czechoslovakia should also relocate their headquarters there. The Ministry of the Interior and the Nostrification Commission, acting under the auspices of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Entrepreneurship, decided that most members of the management board of such a company should be registered as permanently resident in Czechoslovakia, which made it possible to appoint more Czechs as board members. The nostrification process included Czech companies and banks injecting capital into such companies, buying their shares and creating a favourable atmosphere for their business activity.[CITATION-71] The terms of public tenders presented another means by which pressure could be put on companies, including factories owned by Germans, to employ Czech workers.[CITATION-72] was the major employer in Cieszyn Silesia. The company owned an iron and steel works in T\u0159inec [Pol. Trzyniec], several mines, coke plants and other establishments. It employed 11,000 workers before the First World War.[CITATION-73] Its headquarters was transferred from Vienna to Brno in 1920 under the Nostrification Act, and in 1923 it changed its name to. From 1920, a majority share in the company was held by a French corporation,, and the biggest Czech bank,, was the key Czech shareholder.[CITATION-74] The French shareholders pledged to increase the employment of Czechs in the strategically important works in T\u0159inec.[CITATION-75] In April 1922, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Entrepreneurship held an inter-ministerial consultation following a complaint about the alleged Germanisation of the T\u0159inec iron and steel works.provided assurance that the new Czech members of the management board (among whom were the president of the bank, Jaroslav Preiss, and the head of the nationwidegymnastic association, Josef Scheiner) would \u2018work to amend the ethnic situation among workers and clerks\u2019.[CITATION-76] Despite that, in 1923, \u0160r\u00e1mek, the Silesian provincial president in Opava, still believed that the hiring of Czech clerks and engineers in the T\u0159inec plant was insufficiently advanced. He argued that the need to hire more Czech clerks was based on the proximity of the border with Poland and Germany and the fact that the Poles accounted for the majority of workers. He called for changes to be effected before the local elections.[CITATION-77] The head of the office of President Masaryk, P\u0159emysl \u0160\u00e1mal, contacted Scheiner, as a member of the management board, and requested an intervention in favour of employing Czech workers.[CITATION-78] Soon the Ministry of Social Welfare commented with satisfaction that, while in 1920 the works in T\u0159inec employed only 50 Czech workers, three years later there were 790 Czechs.[CITATION-79] It was still a minority, however, as in 1923 the total number of workers at this establishment was 3,668.[CITATION-80] A few years later, another member of the management board, and one of the wealthiest Czechs, Jaroslav Preiss, ordered the management of the T\u0159inec works to employ Czechs exclusively.[CITATION-81] The Chancellery of the President also urged the appointment of \u2018a trustworthy Czech\u2019 as the company inspector at the Gabriela mine in Karvin\u00e1 [Pol. Karwina].[CITATION-82] But the advanced qualifications of German workers and the shortage of appropriate Czech workers was the main obstacle to replacing all German office personnel and engineers with Czechs. Another problem was the Polish miners\u2019 negative attitude towards Czech engineers.[CITATION-83] \u0160\u00e1mal, from Masaryk\u2019s office, indicated that he was well aware that it would only be possible for Czechs to assume leading roles when better qualified Czech personnel appeared.[CITATION-84] By 1925, \u0160r\u00e1mek was able to note with satisfaction that since 1921in Cieszyn Silesia had employed ninety-five Czechs, only eight Germans and one Pole as new clerks, and procurements were mainly ordered from companies owned by Czechs.[CITATION-85] Of course, by \u2018Germans\u2019 and \u2018Poles\u2019, he meant mainly Czechoslovak citizens of respectively German and Polish nationality, who were thus in theory, if not in practice, equal before the law with Czechs.The increase of Czech influence in the mines and coking plants in Karvin\u00e1 which belonged towas also significant. On 1 July 1926, among office workers there were 48 Czechs (19 per cent), 111 Germans (43 per cent) and 99 Poles (38 per cent), but on 1 January 1934 there were 128 Czechs (56 per cent), 55 Germans (24 per cent) and 46 Poles (20 per cent).[CITATION-86] The history of a local Czech school describes Czech workers and engineers as \u2018silent, but resilient and powerful activists\u2019, who \u2018sprung to the aid of a Czech school\u2019. The increase in the number of children in the Czech school in 1927 was attributed to one of the engineers of the Barbara mine; dissatisfaction was expressed about the insufficient involvement of staff in other mines in the promotion of Czech schooling.[CITATION-87] There were other instances of successful nostrification, including that of.[CITATION-88] Another way to gain influence was by purchase: in 1926 the state bought mines from[CITATION-89] and in 1933bought.[CITATION-90] An example of the pressure of the state on private companies was the negotiation about the transformation ofinto a public limited company. The Ministry of Industry, Trade and Entrepreneurship communicated the conditions set by the Ministry of National Defence,, that the number of Czech or Slovak officials in the company should correspond to the national proportions of the employed workers, and at the same time that all workers should be Czech or Slovak only.[CITATION-91] The company was ready to meet the first condition. As for the latter, it did not agree to the mass dismissal of all Polish and German workers and could not completely exclude the possibility of their employment in the future, although it was ready to state that it would not work to the detriment of the \u2018Czech character of the Ostrava region\u2019.[CITATION-92] Eventually the transformation into public limited company was not finalised, yet in 1936,, a Czech nationalist association, was satisfied with the changes that had been made in(belonging to), as well as in,andcompanies: Czechs were favoured in all of them. The association, however, criticised the situation in the company owned by Johann Larisch-M\u00f6nnich, a local landowner and industrialist. Allegedly, here German clerks were laid off and replaced by Czechs too sluggishly. Meanwhile, it was alleged that German domination was retained in(coal mines and coke plant), Hahn\u2019s rolling mill factory in Bohum\u00edn [Pol. Bogumin] and some companies in Fry\u0161t\u00e1t.[CITATION-93] Poles tended to own only small enterprises, such as sawmills, brickyards and co-operative societies. In the industrial sector, Poles were workers, not managers and owners. Their representatives complained that Poles were forced to join Czech organisations and the Czech nationalist trade union (), and to send their children to Czech schools, if they wanted to avoid being laid off or to have the opportunity to earn wages on an extra shift. In the event of collective redundancies, Poles were discharged first.[CITATION-94] Complaints by the Polish minority were rejected. According to the Moravian\u2013Silesian provincial president in Brno, Jan \u010cern\u00fd, the authorities did not receive any complaints concerning attempts to force Polish workers to send their children to Czech schools and to join Czech organisations. In May 1934, he claimed that since the beginning of 1933, 1,146 Czechs, 616 Poles and 81 Germans had been discharged in the industrial sector in Cieszyn Silesia.[CITATION-95] The figures quoted by \u010cern\u00fd were misleading. State mining offices in Moravsk\u00e1 Ostrava and in Brno (subordinated to the Ministry for Public Works) calculated their own statistics for the years 1921, 1928 and 1938, which showed that the percentage of Poles employed in particular businesses in this period fell sharply, although we should note that the methodology by which these statistics were generated is unclear. The data from 1928 are described as referring to the mother tongue of the workers, not nationality, and theoretically a mother tongue could have been different to declared nationality. We can assume that the data show the answers given by workers to their bosses about their mother tongue (in 1928) and nationality (1921 and in 1938), or by management officials themselves, in particular engineers, who drew up such statistics relying on their personal knowledge of their subordinates. And it is indeed possible that nationality (or \u2018mother tongue\u2019) was identified according to the school to which workers sent their children: a parent of a child sent to a Czech school may have been considered a member of the Czech nation with Czech as his mother tongue. Unfortunately, the figures from 1938 are not precise about the numbers concerning Czechs and Germans, but only with regard to Poles in comparison to the rest of the employees.The data which follow include only mines and coking plants in the Fry\u0161t\u00e1t and Fr\u00fddek districts. In 1921, these enterprises employed 36,566 workers: 67.89 per cent Czechs, 31.12 per cent Polish and 0.99 per cent Germans. In 1928, there were 30,208 workers, of whom the workers described as having Czech as their mother tongue accounted for 69.45 per cent of the total, Polish as their mother tongue 29.19 per cent, and German 1.23 per cent. In 1938, a total of 24,157 workers were employed (data for Larisch-M\u00f6nnich\u2019s coking plant in Karvin\u00e1 are missing\u2014in 1928 it employed 338 people), of whom Poles accounted for 16.71 per cent.For the purpose of clarity, when comparing percentages of workers with Polish as their mother tongue (in 1928) and Polish nationality (in 1921 and 1938) in the particular companies analysed below, I will simply use the term \u2018Poles\u2019 or \u2018Polish\u2019. Where an enterprise was under Czech control, the decrease in the percentage of Poles was more significant. For instance, in businesses owned by, the number of Polish workers decreased from 93.5 per cent in 1921 and 63.7 per cent in 1928 to 40 per cent in 1938 in the Gabriela mine (Karvin\u00e1); in the Hohenegger mine (Karvin\u00e1) it decreased from 91.6 per cent in 1921 and 67.4 per cent in 1928 to 25.9 per cent in 1938; in the Hohenegger coking plant (Karvin\u00e1) the numbers were 80.2 per cent, 78.4 per cent and 28.2 per cent. Only in the Barbara mine (Karvin\u00e1) was there an increase, from 22.7 per cent in 1928 to 36.7 per cent in 1938, but this followed a sharp decrease from 83.6 per cent in 1921. In the Michal mine (Mich\u00e1lkovice), owned by, the ratio of Poles was reduced from 33.4 per cent in 1921 and 20.3 per cent in 1928 to 0.9 per cent in 1938 and in the Hubert mine (Hru\u0161ov) from 30.7 per cent in 1921 and 20.2 per cent in 1928 to 2.5 per cent in 1938. In the Doubrava mine owned bythe number of Poles decreased from 25.2 per cent in 1921 and 9.4 per cent in 1928 to 2.2 per cent in 1938.An interesting case is presented by mines owned by three firms in the western part of Fry\u0161t\u00e1t district:and two other companies (the mines owned by the latter companies were purchased by the state in 1926 and 1931), where the number of Poles increased between 1921 and 1928 and decreased again in 1938. In the mines and one coking plant owned bythe number of Poles increased from 13.2 per cent in 1921 to 29.4 per cent in 1928 and then decreased to 19.6 per cent in 1938. Overall, the absolute number of miners was decreasing systematically.[CITATION-96] The increase between 1921 and 1928 was probably connected with the activity of a Czech plebiscite militia in the neighbourhood and the closure of Polish schools in the municipalities of Poruba [Pol. Por\u0119ba] and Pet\u0159vald [Pol. Pietwa\u0142d] in 1920. Demands for their reinstatement were denied by the authorities on the grounds that there was no Polish population.[CITATION-97] Only in 1926 did the authorities agreed to establish a new Polish school in Poruba and by then the circumstances for local Poles to declare their nationality were less unfavourable than in the direct aftermath of riots connected to the plebiscite.The situation of Poles was more favourable in Larisch-M\u00f6nnich\u2019s businesses in Karvin\u00e1 and Horn\u00ed Such\u00e1 [Pol. Sucha G\u00f3rna], yet even here there was a decrease\u2014the number of Poles decreased from 76.7 per cent in 1921 to 74.1 per cent in 1928 and 58.7 per cent in 1938. Only in this enterprise was there a significant proportion of clerks and supervisory staff of Polish descent: in 1938 such clerical and management staff amounted to 32.1 per cent at the Jan-Karel mine, 26.6 per cent at the Franti\u0161ka mine, 30 per cent at the Hlubina mine and 44.1 per cent at the Franti\u0161ek mine.[CITATION-98] Aside from the possible discrepancies between mother tongue and nationality, we can assume that the decrease in the number of Poles was not simply a result of retirements and lay-offs (during the Great Depression almost a third of miners were made redundant and in the following years only a small number were hired).[CITATION-99] Some Poles ceased to admit to their nationality. The nature of these conversions to Czech (and in some cases German) nationality, obviously differed greatly, ranging from a real change of heart to a forced and superficial adoption of a new national identity. However, as we shall discuss in the next section, the sending of children to Czech schools undoubtedly contributed to the Czechification of the younger generation.The opportunities for workers and railwaymen to oppose this repression were limited. Workers\u2019 organisations\u2014affiliated with the socialist parties or Communists\u2014organised strikes and objected to lay-offs during the crisis period. Yet, there was a lack of solidarity between the workers themselves. Polish political parties and Communists defended Polish workers and railwaymen. Czech professional organisations (for example) protected their members (while insisting that they send their children to Czech schools) and believed that foreigners should be first to be dismissed (these were often residents of nearby villages, which in 1920 were on the other side of the border with Poland). Management and German business owners, such as Larisch-M\u00f6nnich, could have resisted these policies more effectively. They were more aware of their rights and had the means to enforce them. They also pointed to the high qualifications of the German specialists, who were often Austrian or German citizens. Yet, their first priority was to protect their own interests.Another issue was access to the schools which were educating new professional industrial classes. Germans were considered to be over-represented in senior positions in relation to the proportion of Germans living in the region. Members of the Polish minority demanded the reopening of a Polish mining school in Doubrava [Pol. D\u0105browa], which was expected to educate Polish technical staff so as to prevent Poles being employed only in subordinate positions. The school had been established in 1907 during the Habsburg period and was closed by the Czechs during the Polish\u2013Czech conflict.[CITATION-100] \u010cern\u00fd claimed that the Czech mining school in Moravsk\u00e1 Ostrava was sufficient for the needs of the region: every year three or four Poles attended the school.[CITATION-101] However, figures provided by the Ministry of Education and National Enlightenment show that in the 1920s there was a dramatic decrease in the number of Polish and German students at the school. In 1922/1923, 133 Czechs, 32 Germans and 20 Poles studied at the school. In the following years the number began to fall and in 1926/27 there were 102 Czech students and only one German and one Polish student. According to the Ministry the change showed the \u2018impartiality\u2019 of the school\u2019s recruitment.[CITATION-102] The candidates were selected by companies\u2019 management boards.[CITATION-103] Officially, the state had no influence on the ethnic proportions in the school, yet, as was shown above, it made efforts to give Czechs stricter control over companies. The situation was aggravated by economic crisis and reduced demand for coal in the 1930s. As a result, only a small proportion of graduates were offered the prospect of being appointed to senior positions in the mines, which additionally reduced the Polish minority\u2019s chances of social advancement.[CITATION-104] The establishment of an industrial and master\u2019s technical school in Karvin\u00e1 in 1921, on the initiative of, also served Czech national goals. The government commissioner in Karvin\u00e1, Anton\u00edn Kr\u016fta, indicated the need to educate the Czechs, who would \u2018defend the border\u2019 against Polish and German irredentism. In this case, the Office of the President of the Republic supported the motion for subsidising the school,[CITATION-105] funding which, within a short time, was provided exclusively by the state.[CITATION-106] In the case of both the railwaymen and industrial workers of Cieszyn Silesia, the Czechoslovak state authorities took action that had a common goal\u2014the Czechification of the region. The main difference in the approach of the state administration to railwaymen and industrial workers was the direct dependence of the former on the state as their employer. This was the easiest group to target. But state action also had an indirect impact on industrial workers. It created conditions conducive to discrimination and pressure to assimilate. Government officials had at their disposal data showing a clear decrease in the number of Polish workers. At the same time, they rejected all complaints and hid behind the lack of impact on employment in private enterprises. Chmel\u00e1\u0159\u2019s opinion, highlighted at the start of this article, that workers had declared themselves victims of national oppression to gain certain benefits is not confirmed in the documents. However, his statement that the dismissed Polish workers sought support in the \u2018majority national orientation\u2019 can be treated as an allusion to Czechification. The aim of this study has not been to prove that the Czechoslovak government\u2019s policy was entirely discriminatory towards minorities. Rather, it shows the limits of the adoption of democratic processes in specific circumstances. Despite liberal legislation, the Czechoslovak government at different levels (including police, gendarmerie and railways) adhered to a consensus that minorities who were perceived as adversely affecting the state could be treated in a way that violated the principle of equality under the law. Ethnic policy was not implemented according to a specific plan, and the expansion of Czech influence did not focus on any particular sector. Instead, the government\u2019s activities consisted in taking advantage of opportunities to strengthen Czech influence. At the same time, it tried to keep up the appearance of impartiality to the outside world. This was also important for the international credibility of the new state of Czechoslovakia.The ethnic policy pursued by the state administration in Cieszyn Silesia could perhaps be best described as \u2018moderate progress within the bounds of the law\u2019, with the reservation that the bounds of law were often crossed.[CITATION-107] The actions undertaken by state administration violated those provisions which guaranteed the equality of all citizens and prohibited depriving minorities of their national identity; provisions which were laid down in Czechoslovak constitution of 29 February 1920 and the Treaty of Saint-Germaine-en-Laye of 10 September 1919, and other statutes, among them the Act against Oppression and for the Protection of Freedom in Public Assemblies of 12 August 1921.[CITATION-108] The actions against railwaymen and workers affected other inhabitants of the region as well. They showed the strength of the state and the influence of Czech nationalist activists. At the same time, the state provided support for the development of national education in the region. In many localities, Czech schools were established as private schools on the initiative of. Within a short period of time, these schools were taken over by the state as so-called minority schools, because they were to ensure the protection of Czech minorities in localities inhabited by Poles or Germans. Jan Kukl\u00edk and Ren\u00e9 Petr\u00e1\u0161 have suggested that, contrary to the expectations of Czech nationalists, such schools did not play a significant role in broadening the influence of Czech nationality, but strengthened the negative attitude of national minorities to the state.[CITATION-109] Perhaps this is correct with regard to the areas where the German minority predominated, but in Cieszyn Silesia, minority schools, combined with economic pressure, contributed to the assimilation of the local population.In order to evaluate fully Czechoslovak official policy towards national minorities, it must be considered in the context of the daily struggle for material existence, which had a much greater impact on the perception of political reality by \u2018ordinary people\u2019 than more abstract issues such as language rights in offices and courts, or nationalist struggles in the symbolic sphere. It was these everyday problems which affected political choices and attitudes towards the state. The state practices described in this article undermined trust in the democratic system, with the result that social uncertainty was accompanied by strong official pressures which restricted the opportunities to exercise legally sanctioned civil liberties.Obviously, some people accepted Czech nationality without many scruples or even treated it as an opportunity to gain a sense of security and stability in life. As we have already indicated, this was a matter of individual approach and one can note an array of various attitudes. As soon as the new Czechoslovak state emerged, a proportion of local citizens gradually began to perceive Czech culture as dominant, and one which assured a decent life. That reality notwithstanding, it is also true that where pressure exists, entirely free decisions are difficult to take. Formal assumption of a new nationality did not necessarily mean that the issue of nationality was of no importance to the person who made such a decision. A person whose social standing was weaker had more limited choices concerning their employment. Salary levels were not unimportant, but were instead a condition for providing a decent standard of life to families with, as was common, many children. However, the adoption of the \u2018Czech national orientation\u2019 in the localities where it was a new phenomenon had its price. It could sever existing social ties and cause conflicts between relatives and neighbours who spoke the same dialect. The information we possess about those railwaymen who started to avoid Polish cultural events and joined Czech national life reflects how much serious interference was exercised by the state or byactivists, who regularly prepared secret reports on railwaymen\u2019s political attitudes, and even on their family and property situation.[CITATION-110] In 1914, in the area of the later Czechoslovak districts of Fry\u0161t\u00e1t and \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn, 7,582 pupils attended Czech schools, 8,537 attended German schools and 22,314 attended Polish schools. In 1938, 24,167 children attended Czech schools, 3,138 attended German schools and 9,335 attended Polish schools.[CITATION-111] Even if not all pupils later became Czechs, the situation led to a gradual cultural transformation of the region. Polish memoirs of this period include recurring motifs. Czech social activists or superiors at work threatened to dismiss parents who did not want to send their children to Czech schools. Edward Bu\u0142awa from Louky [Pol. \u0141\u0105ki] reminisced that in 1932, when his father was dismissed from the Barbara mine () for participation in a Polish parent-teacher association, many children from the neighbourhood were transferred from a Polish to a Czech school. Five years later, his father was offered a job on the condition that he would move his children to a Czech school. At his new school Edward met many former friends from his previous Polish school: \u2018Many of them were not reconciled to their fate. However, most of them accepted the situation, as indoctrination started to bring the desired results\u2019.[CITATION-112] In Czech memoirs, by contrast, these issues are not mentioned explicitly. Marta Rulfov\u00e1, a railwayman\u2019s daughter, from N\u00e1vs\u00ed [Pol. Nawsie] who attended a Czech school and considered herself Czech, mentioning her father, noticed that he was strongly critical concerning politics, and considered himself neither Polish nor Czech, but Silesian.[CITATION-113] This remark also reflects the negative experiences of having to adapt to a series of changing statehoods in the region over the twentieth century.In 1938 the First Czechoslovak Republic collapsed after the Munich Agreement, by which representatives of Germany, Italy, Great Britain and France ceded borderlands mostly inhabited by German minorities, to the Third Reich. After the Munich Conference, the Polish government issued an ultimatum demanding that the Prague government should yield territories inhabited by the Polish minority (Fry\u0161t\u00e1t and \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn districts). On 1 October, Czechoslovakia complied with the ultimatum and in the following days the Polish Army took over the area and was enthusiastically welcomed by local Poles. Czechs now became the subject of oppression; all Czech organisations and schools were disbanded; and many Czechs were forced to leave the territory of the Republic of Poland and their homes. In September 1939, after the German invasion of Poland, the disputed region was annexed to the Reich, which was followed by the implementation of a policy of brutal terror. All Polish institutions and associations were banned and Poles became second-class people. In 1945, the frontiers in Cieszyn Silesia were reinstated to those which had existed before 1938. Major industrial plants were nationalised, Germans were displaced and Poles remained a minority. The negative experiences from the period of the First Republic and the impossibility of restoring their own political parties led a majority of the Polish community to support the Communists. The Communist takeover in Czechoslovakia in 1948 started a completely new period in the history of the region. Former methods of ethnic oppression were condemned, but they were replaced by a totalitarian dictatorship, which reserved the right to settle all matters concerning ethnic minorities and all social activity. Nationalist thinking did not disappear either.[CITATION-114] The phenomena described above occurred in other regions of Czechoslovakia, and representatives of minorities in these areas did voice similar complaints. One should not, however, automatically assume that the mechanisms employed in Cieszyn Silesia were identical to those used in other parts of the country. The distinctive character of the local situation was determined by a number of factors, including: the strategic location of a region to which a neighbouring country submitted a territorial claim; a smaller population of the Polish minority, which allowed faster assimilation; the prevailing social structure; and a notable affinity between the Polish and Czech languages. Nevertheless, a closer look at the complaints about the oppression of workers and railwaymen in other regions of Czechoslovakia\u2014taking into account the broad available source base\u2014would merit further investigation.Nor were actions against ethnic minorities a specifically Czechoslovak issue: they were common in the whole of East and Central Europe in the inter-war period. In all \u2018nationalistically oriented countries\u2019 of the period, discriminatory activities towards ethnic minorities were undertaken to a greater or lesser extent. Despite equal justice under the law for all citizens, regardless of their ethnic identity, being a declared principle, there was a belief that there was one state-building nation and as such it was entitled to hold a privileged position. This belief was connected with mistrust towards ethnic minorities. The fact that a significant proportion of citizens did not identify with the country they were living in but with a foreign homeland was used to justify the state authorities\u2019 efforts to weaken the standing of these minorities. These discriminatory actions and limitations heightened the sense of wrongdoing and fuelled resentment against the state authorities, thus confirming the belief prevalent among the minority population that they were living in an alien state.The problem of discrimination or dismissal of workers and/or railwaymen on grounds of nationality has been mentioned in studies concerning Germany,[CITATION-115] Poland,[CITATION-116] Lithuania,[CITATION-117] Italy[CITATION-118] and Yugoslavia[CITATION-119] , among others. Nostrification in the Polish part of Upper Silesia played a similar role to that in Czechoslovakia.[CITATION-120] Efforts were made to reduce the number of foreigners working in industry in Estonia,[CITATION-121] Bulgaria[CITATION-122] and Romania.[CITATION-123] The methods certainly differed according to prevailing regional characteristics: the degree of industrialisation; the role of industry and railways in the wider social structure; and the extent of opportunities to assimilate. But research on all these issues can certainly be deepened, as can analysis of the role of the state in processes of assimilation and discrimination, degrees of adherence to legal frameworks and efforts to influence changes in national attitudes.",
