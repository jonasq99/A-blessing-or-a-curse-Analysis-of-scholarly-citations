    "article": "This article refutes a fundamental assumption behind the Western powers\u2019 \u2018long-war strategy\u2019 in 1939, and casts doubt on the conventional wisdom regarding the alleged unpreparedness of Nazi Germany for a longer war. It does so by re-examining Germany\u2019s war-preparedness through the lens of those raw materials that were of vital importance for the production of all armaments: non-ferrous metals. Contemporaries believed that these metals were the Achilles heel of the Nazi war economy because Germany had to cover its consumption predominantly with imports from overseas, which meant that it was extremely vulnerable to a sea blockade. But this article challenges these assumptions and shows that the Nazi war-planners were prepared for a longer war because of the lessons learned from the Great War, which they had carefully and covertly studied. The statistics compiled in this article demonstrate that it was the preparations based on these lessons rather than contingencies and non-predictable events, such as the access to occupied Europe due to unexpected victories, that were primarily responsible for the fact that Germany did not run out of metals during the Second World War. Germany lost the war not because of a lack of economic preparation, at least not in the field of metals, but because of the strategic decision to start a war which was bound to draw in an ever more superior coalition of enemies the longer it lasted.Scholars have long used developments and decisions in the field of Nazi economic policy to obtain an insight into Hitler\u2019s reasoning and intentions, especially with regard to the late 1930s and the coming of war.[CITATION-1] This is because Hitler\u2019s statements during this period were often of a tactical and hence contradictory nature, which can therefore be used to support different scholarly interpretations.[CITATION-2] Policies relating to strategically important non-ferrous metals are among those that have been used to this end.[CITATION-3] These metals, such as copper and nickel, were indispensable for waging war because they were used in most of the commodities demanded by the Wehrmacht, including shells, armoured steel, and electrical equipment.[CITATION-4] Yet, in the case of most metals, pre-war Germany was heavily dependent on imports, in particular (and in contrast to oil) from overseas.[CITATION-5] Having experienced the Great War naval blockade, Hitler and other leading Nazis had to expect that these imports would be cut off in a war involving Britain as an antagonist.[CITATION-6] In spite of this expectation and the vital importance of non-ferrous metals for waging war, scholars agree that the Third Reich was badly prepared for a blockade and that the German economy would certainly have run out of metals after only one or two years.[CITATION-7] In the late 1930s the Western powers made similar coverage predictions (of about fifteen to eighteen months at most), and considered metals, besides fuel, to bemajor weakness of the Nazi economy.[CITATION-8] This strengthened the resolve of the British government to declare war on Germany and decisively influenced its \u2018long-war strategy\u2019, that is, to choke Germany economically before defeating it militarily.[CITATION-9] Scholars also agree that little had been done before the war to reduce Germany\u2019s import dependency and that no significant consumption reductions by way of substitution and conservation had been implemented.[CITATION-10] In addition, no rational war preparations, such as detailed mobilisation plans, seem to have been put in place in the field of non-ferrous mining.[CITATION-11] Therefore, it seems at first glance that the German war-planners had not learned the lessons of the Great War and were not prepared for a longer conflict. Adam Tooze has recently claimed that nobody expected in 1939 that Germany could sustain a war as long as the Great War.[CITATION-12] Germany\u2019s low raw material stocks made it unlikely. Accordingly, scholars dismiss contemporary statements by Hitler and other Nazi leaders that Germany was actually well prepared for a blockade as propaganda or as a \u2018theatre of illusion\u2019.[CITATION-13] Relying on these assumptions about the unpreparedness of the German economy, scholars conclude that Hitler was obliged to make an extremely risky gamble in the winter of 1939/40, when he ordered the use of the raw material stocks for an attack against the Western powers.[CITATION-14] The fact that Germany, in contrast to the Allied powers\u2019 expectations, failed to run out of metals after one or two years, and that it did not lose the war because of a lack of metals, is explained by contingencies and non-predictable events\u2014especially Germany\u2019s unexpected victories, which granted access to occupied Europe and its resources, and the \u2018ingenuity\u2019 of German engineers in conserving and substituting raw materials, especially once Albert Speer had become Armament Minister in 1942.[CITATION-15] This article reconsiders the validity of all these statements by testing them against the availability of new economic and statistical evidence in the vitally important field of metals.Assumptions about an ill-prepared Germany have long gone unquestioned because of their close fit with dominant scholarly paradigms. Even though historians disagree over how strong the German economy was at the end of the 1930s,[CITATION-16] they agree that Germany was not ready for a \u2018long war\u2019 in 1939.[CITATION-17] This was because Hitler planned to carry out only short wars (the \u2018Blitzkrieg hypothesis\u2019), or because the envisaged major European war came prematurely.[CITATION-18] The latter opinion is expressed by proponents of a second important interpretation (the \u2018Inefficiency hypothesis\u2019), who explain the poor armament output during the first years of the war not by Hitler\u2019s lack of willingness fully to mobilise the German economy, but by the growing inefficiency and confusion of the military economy. This is said to have been caused by a number of structural and institutional factors, including a lack of central administrative control and rival bureaucracies involved in constant power struggles, a lack of incentives for firms to produce more efficiently, and the untimely outbreak of the war.[CITATION-19] As a consequence, the use of those resources that were mobilised, such as raw materials, was ineffective, and substitution and conservation of scarce metals rather limited compared to later years. These inefficiencies, argue adherents of this hypothesis, only began to be overcome from mid-1941 onwards, especially once Albert Speer had been appointed armament minister in early 1942. In general, scholars frequently doubt whether even pre-war economic policies were successful, in part because the problems of administrative struggles (polycratic chaos)[CITATION-20] and a lack of centralisation can also be observed prior to the war.[CITATION-21] The autarky measures of the Four-Year Plan are often regarded as a failure,[CITATION-22] and the German economic administration, especially with regard to raw materials, as incompetent.[CITATION-23] Yet more recent studies challenge these long-standing paradigms and position the Nazi economy within an altogether different conceptual framework. Whereas previous interpretations sought to explain German defeat, and thus focused on German shortcomings in war planning and mobilisation, scholars have now begun to turn this question on its head. Rather than asking why the German war economy ultimately failed, they are exploring how it enabled Germany to hold out for so long against a far superior coalition.[CITATION-24] Recent studies on science policy,[CITATION-25] investment policy[CITATION-26] and armament production[CITATION-27] in the Third Reich have collectively questioned long-held assumptions about the incompetence of German economic administration up to 1942, about the importance of the rationalisation drive in the second half of the war, and whether German authorities prepared only for short wars. In addition, recent scholarship on the administrative workings of the Third Reich has argued that previous research has tended to overestimate the negative impact of inter-ministerial turf battles on administrative efficiency.[CITATION-28] All these studies suggest that the German capacity for economic mobilisation was considerably greater than has long been assumed and that economic policy was far more continuous than was earlier believed.Such findings demand a re-examination of Nazi Germany\u2019s preparations to become \u2018blockade safe\u2019. This is especially true for non-ferrous metals. Despite the fact that German metal policy has been taken to epitomise the allegedly failed economic war preparations of the Nazi regime, metals are not only far less well researched than other autarky industries during the Third Reich, but existing studies rely on a very limited source basis and sometimes contradictory quantitative data.[CITATION-29] This article, based primarily on previously unused source material from several public and company archives, re-evaluates German metal policy with a special focus on four vitally important metals: copper, tin, tungsten and nickel. With regard to these metals, Germany depended before the war nearly exclusively or primarily on supply from overseas.[CITATION-30] By examining these metals, the article makes three major contributions. First, it provides a comprehensive account of one main but neglected focus of the Four-Year Plan, that is, metals, and analyses and quantifies the war preparations in this field as well as their implementation after 1939. Secondly, it addresses a long-standing research lacuna[CITATION-31] by tracing how the experiences of the Great War shaped preparations for the next war. It shows that the German authorities had begun in the 1930s to put in motion programmes, based on the lessons learned from the Great War, that would allow them to massively cut consumption and increase supplies in case of war. Finally, the article shows that because of these measures, which were partly disguised through the use of disinformation, Germany was far better prepared in the vitally important field of metals than has long been believed. More broadly, the article challenges established understandings of German war preparedness, and argues that the Nazis may have believed in 1939 that they were sufficiently prepared, when it came to the field of non-ferrous metals, for a major, long-duration European war. The extent of Hitler\u2019s gamble in 1939, at least regarding these vitally important raw materials, was thus significantly smaller than scholars have believed. Germany lost the war not because of a lack of preparation, certainly not in the field of metals, but because of the strategic decision to start a war which was bound to draw in an ever more superior coalition of enemies the longer it lasted.When the German authorities started to prepare for the next conflict, the Great War had been over for only fifteen years. As a consequence, it was not only very present in the minds of the leading Nazis, but the administrative and ministerial bureaucracy tasked with this preparation often consisted of people who had already served in Imperial Germany\u2019s war administration.[CITATION-32] They were acutely aware that the problems Germany had faced with regard to metals in 1914 remained the same in the 1930s: on the one hand, a huge overseas import dependency, and, on the other hand, the fact that these metals were essential for waging war. Thus, it would have been surprising if the experiences of the Great War were ignored when preparing for the next war. In learning the lessons of the Great War, those in charge of war preparation could draw not only on their personal experiences, but also on relevant publications by former members of Imperial Germany\u2019s war administration.[CITATION-33] Moreover, they could consult several specific studies, full of details and statistics, originally commissioned by the Imperial government in order to learn from the Great War. While the publication of these studies had been suppressed for several reasons during the 1920s, a few classified copies were circulated among German governmental agencies.[CITATION-34] This body of restricted material on the Great War\u2019s lessons for the war economy grew remarkably after the Nazis took power. In the field of metals alone, and in the main on behalf of different agencies of the Nazi government, the military history department of the German National Archive (Reichsarchiv) and its successor institutions wrote several studies between 1933 and 1939, often occupying more than a hundred pages, and sometimes several volumes (see). These studies covered all important aspects of Imperial Germany\u2019s war metals policy. Based on rich qualitative and quantitative archival material as well as on interviews with former key personnel, they facilitated the transfer of knowledge from the Great War to the planners of the Second World War.[CITATION-35] These studies were heavily classified and even stored in strong-rooms.[CITATION-36] Nonetheless, they were regularly used by the German administration during the 1930s and 1940s.[CITATION-37] The significance of these surveys is reflected in the fact that they were condensed into a sort of encyclopaedia on the behalf of the Heereswaffenamt (HWA), the agency responsible for the technical development of armaments and the organisation of the production of munitions.[CITATION-38] This encyclopaedia, including an index and references to the surveys, served as a quick reader for the employees of the HWA and provided precise suggestions for the next war. The classified book series from the early 1920s whose publication was suppressed also had a significant impact on Germany\u2019s war preparation. In 1937 the German war minister Werner von Blomberg wrote, in a congratulatory letter for the 80th birthday of the series\u2019 editor, Max Sering, that \u2018today\u2019s Wehrmacht was built up on the basis of your work in the past, and because of this, [your work] constitutes one of the foundations of the present military science studies\u2019.[CITATION-39] In 1940, one of the authors of this series even became head of the department for steel and metals in the newly founded ministry for munitions because of his expertise.[CITATION-40] Given this knowledge transfer from the experiences of the Great War, there can be no doubt that the German war planners had precise knowledge of how to overcome the effects of a future sea blockade.Learning from the Great War: classified studies related to non-ferrous metals during the inter-war period.Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (VDI),(Berlin, 1923) (unpub.); BArch, RH 61/860, Kriegsgeschichtliche Forschungsabteilung des Heeres, \u2018Rohstoff-Referat, Im Panzerschrank aufzubewahrende Arbeiten\u2019, 25 June 1942; Hildebrand an von Kalm, \u2018Vorhandene Arbeiten und Unterlagen\u2019, 13 Apr. 1943; Inventare des Reichsarchivs, \u2018Im Auftrag der 7.

In the spring of this year, the Reichsbank\u2019s foreign currency reserves diminished dramatically, largely because the decline of exports that had started in 1932 continued, while imports of raw materials and foodstuffs rose on account of the needs of rearmament and growing civilian demand caused by the upswing of the economy.[CITATION-41] Hjalmar Schacht, president of the Reichsbank since 1933 and Minister for Economic Affairs since August 1934, implemented his \u2018New Plan\u2019 () in order to improve the German balance of payments in the long run. Scarce foreign currency was to be used primarily for essential imports: foodstuffs, raw materials and semi-finished goods for rearmament and the export industry. Around the same time, the use of some metals for certain purposes was prohibited and their substitution ordered.[CITATION-42] For example, newly installed power lines were to be produced with aluminium instead of copper.[CITATION-43] The institution in charge of the substitution programmes, as well as monitoring the prohibitions, was the newly founded \u00dcberwachungstelle f\u00fcr Metalle (Monitoring Agency for Metals).[CITATION-44] This policy was strengthened in the following years, especially after the Four-Year Plan was implemented in the autumn of 1936. In his famous secret memorandum about the Four-Year Plan, Hitler sketched the policies necessary to prepare Germany for a war.[CITATION-45] In this context he emphasised the role that substitutes, such as light metals, and substitution research should play in further reducing the consumption of non-ferrous metals. This was without doubt a lesson that German war planners had learned from the Great War, when substitution and conservation measures in particular had allowed Imperial Germany to continue the war up to 1918.[CITATION-46] As early as 1920, Richard Tr\u00f6ger, the wartime head of the metal section of Imperial Germany\u2019s raw material office, had predicted that in the future technological advances would enable a high level of self-sufficiency in the field of metals.[CITATION-47] A second lesson of the Great War was that there would be a time-lag of some years between the start of substitution research and development (R&D) and the implementation of new measures.[CITATION-48] Consequently, contemporary German authors urged, similarly to Hitler, that substitution should be prepared in advance of the next war.[CITATION-49] The Four-Year Plan authority and other German agencies such as the HWA and the Air Force ministry tried to implement Hitler\u2019s demand through various measures. For example, they massively increased the funding of substitution R&D, established new research institutes and expanded existing ones, arranged exhibitions to increase acceptance of the use of substitutes, and fostered the exchange of substitution know-how among companies.[CITATION-50] R&D was carried out by both public research institutions and private companies. Sometimes the R&D fell entirely to firms, sometimes they were involved only in the testing and development phase.[CITATION-51] Networks of research institutes, universities and companies, which had been established shortly after Hitler came to power, very often co-operated to meet the substitution demands of state agencies.[CITATION-52] Moreover, the state subsidised the build-up of production sites of raw materials which could serve as substitutes, such as zinc, aluminium and vanadium.[CITATION-53] The rationing of non-ferrous metals, implemented in early 1937, was an additional incentive to use substitutes.[CITATION-54] The effects of this pre-war metal substitution and conservation policy were quite impressive. In 1936/7 the use of substitutes, such as light metals or plastics, and metal-conserving constructive modifications had already reduced the domestic consumption of copper by 31 per cent. Reductions in the consumption of tin, nickel and lead, were substantial, too, as is shown in. This consumption reduction, however, did not only negatively affect the quality of products in some cases, but also often entailed higher unit costs for German producers, at least in the short run, even if some cases of cost reductions were also reported.[CITATION-55] Consumption reduction in 1936/7 in the case of non-ferrous metals.For rows (1)\u2013(6), see BArch, R 3112/58, fo. 16, \u2018Schema der Bedarfsminderung durch Austausch von Schwermetallen, Nov. 1937 (Amt f\u00fcr Deutsche Roh- und Werkstoffe)\u2019; BArch, R 3112/165, fos 15, 34, \u2018L\u00f6b zur Nichteisenmetall-Wirtschaft im Vierjahresplan.

Schlie, ed.,(Munich, 2003), p. 330.This substitution process continued up to the outbreak of war: for instance, the ratio of copper and aluminium consumption in the cable industry, normally one of the major copper consumers, which had already massively decreased between 1933 and 1936, continued to drop in the following years.[CITATION-56] The substitution of tin, too, developed in a similar way during these years.[CITATION-57] Between 1935/6 and 1938/9, the content of nickel in construction steel was reduced by 80 per cent, that of chrome and of molybdenum by 31 per cent and 34 per cent respectively.[CITATION-58] In other cases scarce alloys such as tungsten were partially substituted by vanadium, in which Germany was self-sufficient. The monthly vanadium consumption, which had already increased by more than 50 per cent between 1934 and 1936, was in 1938 almost three times higher than in 1936.[CITATION-59] In other words, pre-war substitution was spectacular. Indeed, substitution was a field where the Four-Year Plan\u2019s original quantitative goals and expectations were widely exceeded.[CITATION-60] This success, however, was carefully concealed. From 1935 onwards, the Nazi regime hid the extent of the effects of substitution (and the extent of stockpiling), as the German Statistical Office stopped publishing metal consumption data.[CITATION-61] Thus, the British Industrial Intelligence Centre (IIC), an intelligence hub that was established to investigate German industrial war preparation,[CITATION-62] had to rely on the expert opinion of British producers, which probably explains why it massively overestimated German consumption at the end of the 1930s; by 67 per cent in the case of tin, by 33 per cent in the case of copper, and by 26 per cent in the case of nickel.[CITATION-63] Yet, on the eve of the war, the Nazi regime was fully aware that there was still a significant untapped potential for further conservation of non-ferrous metals. In spite of a massive output increase of substitution material, the demand for, such as aluminium, could not be totally met during the late 1930s.[CITATION-64] Moreover, a major conservation potential existed in armaments production. Even though some substitution programmes had been realised already, and even though massive and successful R&D efforts had been carried out, most of the latter had yet to be implemented in the production process. This was especially the case with regard to copper-intensive ammunition production, which made up between a half and two-thirds of the Wehrmacht\u2019s pre-war copper consumption.[CITATION-65] Early substitution plans had been realised only hesitantly and to a limited extent, for several reasons.[CITATION-66] First, tests took time.[CITATION-67] Secondly, recurring periods of abundant allocation of metals seem to have reduced the incentive to implement such measures.[CITATION-68] In addition, the Wehrmacht, a conservative and quality-oriented institution, occasionally refused to use ammunition made of steel instead of brass. Moreover, the substitution of copper with steel in the case of ammunition required new machine tools, which would have to be produced by the German machinery industry, which had no spare capacity.[CITATION-69] Finally, armament producers were probably also reluctant to use substitutes because companies normally preferred to process raw materials with which they had experience.Yet, in June 1939, a substitution plan for ammunition production to be implemented in case of war was set up on behalf of Hitler.[CITATION-70] In the following weeks, Hermann G\u00f6ring, in his function as head of the Four-Year Plan administration, ordered surveys to identify additional substitution possibilities.[CITATION-71] By late August 1939 the implementation of copper-conserving measures in the armament industries was considered top priority on a list of measures to be carried out immediately in the field of armaments production.[CITATION-72] On 31 August, the immediate conversion to steel shells for use in anti-aircraft guns was ordered. When the war started, many additional substitution measures for scarce metals (for example, in shells, bullet cores, detonators, and driving bands) were ready to be implemented in the production process.[CITATION-73] In order to fully exploit these substantial substitution possibilities, 3,300 new machine tools were required.[CITATION-74] Not only on the demand side, but also on the supply side, the Nazi regime soon implemented a new policy. One major change was increasingly to import ores or scrap instead of more expensive refined metals.[CITATION-75] As a consequence, the capacities of German smelters and refineries, normally subsidised by the state, had to be increased significantly.[CITATION-76] For example, the output of German copper refineries more than doubled between 1928 and 1938, and whereas in 1928 only 36 per cent of the copper consumed in Germany was refined in German smelters, the share in 1937 was 78 per cent.[CITATION-77] One reason for the change of import composition was Germany\u2019s chronic lack of foreign currency.[CITATION-78] Yet the expansion of smelting and refinery capacity, nearly completed in 1938/9 in the eyes of the German war planners, served not only to save foreign currency but also to provide capacity reserves in the event of war.[CITATION-79] This was a lesson of the Great War, when Imperial Germany, which had predominantly imported metals rather than ores before 1914, had had to spend years expanding its smelters and refineries.[CITATION-80] In order to utilise this capacity, the Four-Year Plan administration planned to exploit, as during the Great War, two hidden reserves.[CITATION-81] The first hidden reserve consisted of metal items still in use, such as church bells and copper pans, which were supposed to be mobilised during a war. Hitler himself emphasised this resource in his memorandum on autarky: \u2018War makes possible the mobilisation of all metal available. Because: this is then not an, but a. And the National Socialist State leadership would possess the will, and also the resolution and the toughness, to solve these problems in the event of war. But it is much more important to prepare for war in time of peace!\u2019[CITATION-82] This emphasis on \u2018metal mobilisation\u2019 as a significant source of supply in the case of war was a conclusion of the secret surveys mentioned above; it also mirrors the findings of the publications of former employees in the war economy administration of Imperial Germany.[CITATION-83] One further lesson which the German authorities drew from the experience of the Great War was not only to expand recycling capacities but also to foster recycling R&D.[CITATION-84] The second hidden reserve was German mining. In 1934, the German administration had implemented a new subsidisation scheme for domestic non-ferrous metal mines, aiming to expand production in order to tackle Germany\u2019s balance of payments problems.[CITATION-85] The expansion of German mining output was still being pursued in 1936, when the Third Reich faced a new balance of payments crisis. Hitler demanded in his memorandum on autarky that German mining output should be expanded at all costs.[CITATION-86] Yet it seems that, in the course of the following two years, Hitler\u2019s demand was modified, probably because, after years of significant price increases, metal prices started to drop substantially after the spring of 1937, making imports cheaper.[CITATION-87] Contrary to statements that were still being made in 1936, maximisation of the mining output was no longer the core objective, having been modified by two principles. One clear-cut principle was to increase the absolute output by significant margins only in the case of those metals and mines in which the cost difference from the world market price was comparatively small.[CITATION-88] A second criterion was that output should only be increased substantially where ores were abundant. Both criteria were fulfilled in the cases of lead and zinc, whose mining output was massively expanded.[CITATION-89] If these criteria were not met, however, German ores were to be preserved as \u2018a last reserve\u2019 which should only be used in case of war.[CITATION-90] In peacetime one should concentrate on successfully exploring German ores for future exploitation.[CITATION-91] In wartime, mining should be increased to the extent which had been predetermined for each mine.[CITATION-92] The purpose of metal stocks was mainly to bridge the supply gap between the outbreak of war and the point of time when the hidden reserves, i.e. German ores and metals to be recycled, could be mobilised.[CITATION-93] The regime was quite aware that the non-ferrous metal sector differed in one decisive point from most other sectors such as oil. No quasi-perfect synthetic substitutes were possible. Thus, exploiting the available natural resources, that is, German ores, in order to decrease import dependency during peacetime would leave less for wartime. In other words, the Nazi regime could not have its cake and eat it. To solve this trade-off, it decided at least from late 1937 to postpone a full exploitation of German mines until wartime. In the light of these intentions, the fact that German import dependency remained more or less unchanged during the 1930s does not suggest, as some scholars claim, that the non-ferrous metal policy was a failure.[CITATION-94] This interpretation is confirmed when taking a look at the exploration activities. From 1934 explorations on German soil had to be reported to the state authorities and many explorations were subsidised or even carried out by the state (about a hundred up to 1936 alone), with the main purpose of creating reserve capacities.[CITATION-95] From 1934 Wilhelm Keppler headed these explorations, first as Hitler\u2019s \u2018commissioner of raw materials production\u2019, then directly under the auspices of the Four-Year Plan authority, and from 1939 as president of the newly established Reichsstelle f\u00fcr Bodenforschung (Reich Exploration Agency).[CITATION-96] In 1938 metal exploration was accelerated, and the focus shifted to those projects where mining could be started in a comparatively short period of time.[CITATION-97] Generally, the exploration policy was quite successful over time.[CITATION-98] For example, in the case of nickel, the known metal content of German ores rose rapidly during the last years before the war, from 20,000 tons in 1936 to 40,000 tons in 1939.[CITATION-99] On the eve of the Second World War, German war planners knew that German soil held expensive (in terms of extraction cost) but abundant (in terms of temporary supply coverage) ores.[CITATION-100] In the case of mining and ore reserves, too, the Nazi regime implemented measures of deception. From 1936 on, German authorities hid the extent of newly explored ore reserves as well as information about the metal content of ores mined in Germany.[CITATION-101] The official Statistical Yearbook, which usually covered such aspects in detail, neither mentioned the existence of the huge, newly discovered copper ore reserves in Lower Silesia nor included the ore reserves of these mines in Germany\u2019s official copper reserves.[CITATION-102] The British IIC seems not to have been aware of this potential either, as its wartime mining predictions simply extrapolated from German peacetime output;[CITATION-103] at the very least it did not believe that these reserves would play a role before the war was over.To conclude this section, on the supply side Germany\u2019s pre-war metal policy focused especially on preparing for the exploitation of hidden reserves in the case of war. This policy entailed costs, especially with regard to the enlargement of smelters and refineries and the exploration of German mines. If we add investments in the production of light metals which served largely as substitutes for non-ferrous metals, it becomes clear that up to the beginning of the war only the synthetic fuel industry received more investment, signalling the importance that metals had in the war preparation plans of the Nazis.[CITATION-104] Considering all the measures both on the demand side and on the supply side that were put in motion during the 1930s, one has to conclude that scholarly opinion regarding this vital field is mistaken. Rather than being a failure, war preparation in this field was sophisticated, informed and systematic. The examination of the pre-war metal policy of Nazi Germany suggests, too, that Hitler was indeed preparing for a major war, and not for a series of short wars.This section quantifies, as far as possible, the expectations of the German war planners regarding the monthly coverage of Germany\u2019s estimated wartime consumption in the light of its war preparations and a potential sea blockade. As will be shown, on the eve of the Second World War they must have anticipated that a long (not endless) war would be feasible in terms of the supply of metals. In contrast to previous work on this topic, I do not employ the existing contemporary surveys of some subordinate government agencies. A closer inspection of these studies reveals that they are based on incomplete and inconsistent data as well on problematic assumptions (as they themselves sometimes admit in the fine print).[CITATION-105] Their findings represent in all cases very pessimistic lower limits. This may be partly explained by the specific agenda of their authors.[CITATION-106] More important still seems to have been the secrecy typical of the Third Reich, rooted in the desire to disguise the extent of war preparations. This tactical campaign of deception, which is well known with regard to other fields of war preparation, not only led to restrictions on the publication of sensitive data in the German Statistical Yearbook, as mentioned above, but also limited the information flow among public entities, which even included highly placed Nazis.[CITATION-107] For example, the Reichsamt f\u00fcr wehrwirtschaftliche Planung (Reich Planning Office for the Military Economy) had no access to data on the amount of strategic raw material stocks available to the government.[CITATION-108] Given the weaknesses of the existing surveys, I use scattered information which was available on the eve of the war on expectations concerning the amount of imports, consumption, and the effects of substitution and conservation in the event of war; on supply by metal mobilisation and other sources of recycling; on supplies from German ores; and on German metal stocks in September 1939. The implicit assumption is that the higher echelons of the Nazi regime, especially G\u00f6ring and Hitler, had access to all this information or were at least informed about the general situation in the field of metals. This seems to be very probable not only in the case of G\u00f6ring as head of the Four-Year Plan administration, but also in the case of Hitler. Before and during the war the \u2018F\u00fchrer\u2019, who generally had an active interest in questions regarding raw materials,[CITATION-109] insisted on receiving quantitative information about all aspects of the war economy, sometimes even detecting calculation mistakes himself, and was fully informed about raw material allocation, about which he had the final say.[CITATION-110] Evidence suggests that Hitler had a profound understanding of the situation with regard to non-ferrous metals: the question of how to master the non-ferrous metal supply played a prominent role in his reasoning about economic preparations for war, and he repeatedly intervened in metal policy, especially in the months leading up to the war. For example, non-ferrous metals are explicitly mentioned in three key pre-war documents: in the secret memorandum about the Four-Year Plan; in the Hossbach Protocol of late 1937, in which Hitler outlined his war plans;[CITATION-111] and in a meeting with the Wehrmacht on 22 August 1939, when he was contemplating whether a blockade by the Western powers in case of German aggression against Poland could harm Germany or not.[CITATION-112] Moreover, after having demanded in the summer of 1938 that non-ferrous metal consumption be reduced by additional substitution measures and R&D in this field, so that German consumption needs could be met by German sources, he insisted in June 1939 on establishing a substitution plan for ammunition production, to come into effect in case of war.[CITATION-113] This indicates that Hitler was so fully informed of the scarce metal situation that he knew that additional conservation could be implemented. In July, it was Hitler himself who insisted that the German economy should adapt to a situation in which only non-ferrous metal imports from friendly neighbour countries could be expected.[CITATION-114] So what did the expectations of German war planners look like? Let us first discuss the consumption side. I do not use the existing pre-war consumption projections for the case of war because these figures, as far as they concerned the prospective Wehrmacht consumption, were massively inflated.[CITATION-115] It was for this reason that the authors of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS), who in summer 1945 tried to calculate the monthly consumption coverage of Germany\u2019s stocks, chose the consumption data for the last quarter of 1939 as an indicator for anticipated wartime consumption. I follow the choice of the USSBS with some modifications. One of these concerns the inclusion of the substitution and conservation potential for the metals considered in this article as expected at the end of the 1930s.[CITATION-116] As mentioned above, substantial substitution and conservation possibilities had been prepared for the case of war. Given that we have data on the expected lower limits of substitution effects for 1940, I use these reduced levels of expected consumption as a proxy for expected wartime consumption from 1940 onwards. By doing so, I implicitly assume that later substitution and conservation effects would be offset by an expansion of wartime production. This is probably a conservative assumption. In contrast to the size of armament production, a significant expansion of which compared to the levels early in the war seemed not to be expected by the German planners,[CITATION-117] very substantial future substitution and conservation effects in the field of metals were predicted. Once the war began, the Wehrmacht estimated that the existing and known substitution possibilities could reduce the specific consumption of copper, tin and nickel per output unit of armaments by up to 90 per cent.[CITATION-118] These estimates were not exaggerated from an ex-ante perspective. Whereas the copper\u2013steel ratio in Nazi Germany\u2019s pre-war ammunition production was 4 per cent, the same ratio in April 1918 was significantly lower at 1.8 per cent (and could have been lowered further), indicating that there was still ample room in 1939 for exploiting further conservation and substitution measures.[CITATION-119] Yet the Wehrmacht could not expect fully to exploit the substitution potential mentioned above in the short run. In the case of copper, for example, the authorities were well aware that massive substitution in ammunition production could not be realised before spring 1941 because of a lack of machine tools.[CITATION-120] Moreover, the still too limited capacities of German aluminium plants (not a lack of bauxite) allowed a supply of only two-thirds of the aluminium necessary in order to substitute copper at the beginning of the war.[CITATION-121] On the supply side, we have to examine different sources. One of these was metal mobilisation. At first glance one might expect a lower amount of metals to have been available than during the Great War, given that consumption had been restricted after 1934. Yet a closer look suggests rather the opposite, as the institutions involved in metal rationing should have easily been able to tell. The most important, if only partly tapped, source by far of tin mobilisation during the Great War had been church bells. These, however, had been fully replaced after the Great War and so this source of supply still existed. Moreover, the relatively lower yield of household copper mobilisation would have been more than offset by the huge copper potential of power lines as a result of the massive electrification of the 1920s.[CITATION-122] In the case of nickel, too, the mobilisation potential was far higher than during the Great War, because during the 1930s nickel coins had been explicitly minted in order to be smeltable in case of war.[CITATION-123] Finally, recycling technologies had significantly improved over the last twenty years, not least due to a comprehensive R&D effort financed by German agencies.[CITATION-124] Given all these considerations, I will use the known amounts for the representative metals which were considered to be realisable (nickel coins) or estimates made of the mobilisation potential during the Great War as an ex-ante proxy for the lower limit of metal mobilisation during the Second World War.[CITATION-125] Note that the IIC, with the exception of nickel in coinage, seems to have ignored the possibility of metal mobilisation as an important additional domestic supply source.[CITATION-126] Besides the metal mobilisation I must consider recycling from \u2018normal\u2019 scrap and so-called battlefield scrap. The latter had been important during the Great War and was seen by the German authorities as an additional prospective supply source.[CITATION-127] In the case of \u2018normal\u2019 scrap, I assume, similarly to the German authorities, that the pre-war recycling quotas (in per cent of consumption) of the respective metals could be maintained in the event of war. In the case of battlefield scrap, I employ estimates from the Wehrmacht.[CITATION-128] In the case of the existing stocks, the quantification relies on well-known data. It should be emphasised that Germany\u2019s metal stocks in 1939 were not lower\u2014as one might expect, seeing the chronic balance of payments problems during the 1930s, and as obviously less informed German agencies seem sometimes to have believed\u2014but, thanks to German stockpiling efforts, rather similar or even bigger, in absolute terms, than at the beginning of the Great War. Even in relative terms, that is, in terms of the monthly coverage of wartime consumption, the pre-war stocks in 1914 were not significantly bigger than those in 1939; in the case of copper, for example, stocks in 1914 (around 150,000 tons) covered the consumption of ten months, whereas the stocks in September 1939 (194,000 tons) covered almost nine months.[CITATION-129] In order to assess German mining potential, I use the information found in files of the German authorities in the late 1930s.[CITATION-130] G\u00f6ring and the higher echelons of the Four-Year Plan agency, and probably Hitler too, were regularly informed about explorations by Keppler, who was also Hitler\u2019s economic adviser.[CITATION-131] In keeping with the pre-war expectations of Hitler and of German governmental agencies (as well as of the British), I also include imports from some neutral continental European countries and axis countries in the estimate.[CITATION-132] The data for the various metals and the respective countries derive from secret estimates concerning German imports in the event of war made in 1939 on behalf of the Nazi regime.[CITATION-133] These estimates assumed that re-exports from neutral countries, which had been important for Imperial Germany\u2019s metal supply during the first years of the Great War, would not be possible, or at least not something to rely on, in a future war. This assumption was probably based firstly on the expectation that Germany\u2019s opponents would have learned their lessons by implementing a very rigid system of monitoring right from the beginning of a future conflict, and secondly on the assumption that Germany\u2019s ability to finance imports would be more restricted than during the Great War because of its lower foreign currency reserves. These estimates assumed, too, that wartime metal imports from Scandinavia, Finland, Italy, the Benelux countries, the Baltic states and South-Eastern Europe, excluding re-exports, would beas high as in 1938 and could be financed by German exports.[CITATION-134] This implies that our supply estimate represents a lower limit, especially because the German authorities expected to loot raw materials in conquered countries.[CITATION-135] In the following I examine whether, from the point of view of its metal supply, Germany would have been able to fight a \u2018long war\u2019\u2014that is, one as long as the Great War, or at least three years (as the British assumed in their long-war strategy).[CITATION-136] For this purpose I calculate in a first step the residual between the expected annual consumption (considering the lower limit of substitution and conservation measures) and the expected supply covered by imports, stocks, and recycling in the broader sense. In a second step I examine whether this residual could have been covered by German mining. The results, as shown in detail in Table A1, suggest that German war planners, considering the experiences of the Great War and their hidden reserves, must have assumed on the eve of the war that a longer conflict should be feasible even in the case of a blockade.[CITATION-137] Whereas the British assumed, as mentioned above, that Germany would run out of metals after fifteen to eighteen months, in reality a coverage between two and three times longer seems to have been possible. Theoretically, as Table A1 shows, this would have been the case for copper and nickel even without any German mining. While it is true that a very significant expansion of German mining would have been necessary in the case of tungsten (but not in the case of tin), this would have been possible. Nor would this expansion have taken more than about a thousand workers.[CITATION-138] The mining expansion deemed to be required in order to cover German tungsten consumption for a war of three or almost four years was very similar in size to that put in motion in the summer of 1944, when Germany was cut off from its foreign tungsten supply sources.[CITATION-139] It is worth noting, too, that the factor by which peacetime mining would have had to be expanded is similar to the expansion factor during the Great War.[CITATION-140] Therefore, given these considerations, and the data as well as the estimates produced in Table A1, the Nazis very probably felt sufficiently prepared in, or were at least not too concerned about, the field of metals\u2014which was certainly not the only factor in their risk assessment\u2014even in the event that aggression against Poland resulted in a \u2018long\u2019 (but not endless) European war. This is especially true if one considers that Table A1 includes only the very lower limit of the expected effects of the substitution and conservation measures in the long run. Thus, in contrast to the commonly held belief of the Western powers at the time and of historians since, German stocks would neither solely nor predominantly determine Germany\u2019s metal consumption in a future war. Moreover, statements by Hitler and other Nazi leaders that Germany was actually well prepared for a blockade cannot be dismissed as propaganda in the case of these vital raw materials, as has often been stated in the secondary literature. Finally, as the data clearly shows, using large parts of the metal stocks in early 1940 to prepare the offensive against the Western powers did not imply, as some scholars believe, that Hitler took a very risky gamble\u2014at least not in the case of non-ferrous metals\u2014or that this decision would have prevented him from continuing the war had the offensive failed.All these programmes, prepared during the 1930s, were activated after the beginning of the war. The most spectacularly effective measure, as will be shown, was substitution and conservation. As mentioned above, scholars have long believed that wartime substitution measures were predominantly implemented after 1941. This interpretation seems to be corroborated\u2014at least at first glance\u2014by hard evidence. In the case of most metals, total consumption dropped after 1941 or remained by and large constant, in spite of the rising output of German industry, especially the massively increasing armament production.[CITATION-141] Yet such rough indicators may be misleading for two major reasons. First, in early 1942 a new allocation system was implemented which greatly reduced the incentive to hoard metals illegally.[CITATION-142] As a consequence, official consumption figures for the first half of the war may overstate actual consumption figures relatively more than those for the later period.[CITATION-143] The second criticism with regard to rough indicators such as metal input per total armament output or per industrial production stems from the fact that the denominator of those indicators does not control for changes of the composition of output. Yet data unearthed in German archives widely overcomes the latter problem. This data covers, for most of the quarters between 1939 and mid-1943, the ratio between the allocation of various non-ferrous metals and the basic raw material of most armament goods\u2014steel in the case of two major categories of armaments, ammunition as well as weapons and equipment (such as firearms, guns, tanks, and electrical equipment).[CITATION-144] The data on ammunition in particular is useful for tracing substitution and conservation effects because shells are a comparatively homogeneous good, unlike the broader category of weapons and equipment (W&E).provides some metal\u2013steel ratios for both categories of armaments. For the sake of the readability of the figure, I selected only ratios for those scarce metals whose consumption in the respective category was quantitatively especially significant, compared to total German consumption. The ratios that are not shown here display similar trends. The data clearly suggests, in contrast to the usual narrative, that with regard to substitution there was continuous (though not always steady) progress during the war rather than a caesura in 1942.shows, too, that the substitution potential seems already to have been exploited to a significant extent before 1942, especially in the case of the originally very copper-intensive ammunition production. Moreover, one can see how the substitution measures in ammunition production, which had been prepared during the 1930s and which were implemented very quickly when the war started, had an immediate and massive effect, reducing the specific copper consumption by 40 per cent.[CITATION-145] In the following year the substitution levels increased further, because machine tools necessary for the conversion of the ammunition industry were delivered to the factories as had been planned in 1939.[CITATION-146] In the spring of 1941, the copper\u2013steel ratio of ammunition production matched that of April 1918 (1.8 per cent), before it dropped even further to 0.21 per cent in early 1942 and to 0.13 per cent in the spring of 1943.[CITATION-147] Not only was the absolute specific copper consumption in ammunition production much lower during the Second World War, but the pace of the implementation was also much quicker. This should not surprise us in the light of the pre-war substitution R&D efforts pushed by German authorities. While it took four years during the Great War to reduce the specific consumption of copper in ammunition production by about 80 per cent, the same relative reduction was reached within two years of the outbreak of the Second World War.[CITATION-148] Indeed, in the case of these two important categories of armaments production, the general unwillingness of the Wehrmacht (or at least important parts of it) to accept quality reduction,[CITATION-149] and therefore also substitution and conservation measures, was already overcome or mitigated soon after the war had started, not only later. This was probably not simply due to orders to implement substitution measures at the beginning of the war and the repeated pressure exerted by G\u00f6ring and Hitler to accelerate substitution and conservation of non-ferrous metals in armament production in summer 1939 and the following winter;[CITATION-150] rather, it was also a result of the drastic reduction in the allocation of most non-ferrous metals to the Wehrmacht, copper in particular, in the months before the war.[CITATION-151] Substitution of copper and tin in armament production, 1938/9\u201343 (1938/9=100).: see Appendix, table A2.Other fields of the war economy, and the figures for metals other than tin and copper, reveal similar patterns. This was the case for the massively increasing production of high-grade steels, essential for almost all armaments, as can be seen from the ratio between the consumption of steel alloys (that is, the quantities needed for production) and the output of high-grade steel. Here, too, substantial substitution measures were already implemented during the first half of the war, as the ratios, compared to the level in 1939, suggest (as shown in).[CITATION-152] For example, in 1941, producing one ton of high-grade steel required only 34 per cent of the tungsten quantity that had been needed in 1939. At the same time, vanadium consumption and production increased massively.[CITATION-153] To sum up, the data on wartime conservation and substitution confirms the high expectations the German war planners had in 1939.Use of steel alloys in high-grade steel production, 1939\u201344 (1939=100).: For high-grade steel production, see J\u00e4ger,, p. 305, table 47.Consumption data from 1942 on is an upper limit of consumption in high-grade steel production because allocations for other purposes, such as radio valves or light bulbs, are included.

The volume of substitution of copper by steel in the ammunition production[CITATION-154] and by aluminium alone (.900,000 tons)[CITATION-155] was one-and-a-half times that of the copper inflow from occupied countries and more than fourfold that of German copper stocks on the eve of the war.[CITATION-156] The conservation and substitution of nickel during the war (54,000 tons) was, compared to pre-war levels, even more than double that of the nickel stocks in September 1939 and the inflow from occupied countries combined.[CITATION-157] On the supply side, too, pre-war plans were activated. Immediately after the outbreak of war, the Reichsstelle f\u00fcr Metalle (the former \u00dcberwachungsstelle f\u00fcr Metalle) set up a programme for metal mobilisation.[CITATION-158] It determined that only those measures should be carried out immediately for which no replacement was necessary, while measures entailing high (labour) costs per ton of metal mobilised should be postponed until\u2014if ever\u2014they were really needed.[CITATION-159] However, this principle was\u2014as a result of the experiences of the Great War\u2014overruled by political considerations shortly thereafter. Measures thought likely to cause public unrest, such as the smelting of church bells or the requisitioning of household items, were to be postponed as long as possible. Even among the politically acceptable measures, the opportunity cost principle still dictated the order of collection. In the case of copper and tin in particular, the amount of metals mobilised in Germany was significant, covering respectively 17 per cent (210,000 tons) and 21 per cent (8,814 tons) of Germany\u2019s wartime consumption between 1940 and August 1944. In the case of both metals, this exceeded the amount mobilised during the Great War by a factor of two. The still-existing mobilisation potential for 1945 and 1946 was estimated to be up to 152,000 tons of copper and 5,800 tons of tin. In addition, the Germans activated their pre-war plans to collect scrap on the battlefields, which played an important role, relative to consumption, especially with regard to copper and aluminium.[CITATION-160] For this purpose, as during the Great War, collection teams of soldiers were formed and monetary incentives provided.[CITATION-161] With regard to metal ores, the German war administration continued to carry out geological surveys and to explore and invest in standby mines.[CITATION-162] Whether these standby capacities were fully exploited seems to have depended primarily on opportunity cost considerations. For most of the war, it was less expensive to expand the metal mobilisation of copper and tin, to plunder occupied countries, or to import these metals than to increase the mining of these ores.[CITATION-163] As a consequence, a substantial expansion of mining was only considered when alternative supply sources were expected to be reduced or to run dry. This is apparent in the cases of tungsten and nickel, for which metal mobilisation measures played no role (tungsten) or a relatively minor role (nickel). In the case of tungsten, the exploration programme continued after the start of the war.[CITATION-164] In 1942, the Reichsamt f\u00fcr Bodenforschung considered the German tungsten mines as rich as those of Portugal and Spain.[CITATION-165] By the end of 1942, when annual German production amounted to only 180 tons, standby capacities would have allowed an immediate annual output increase to 700 tons, roughly one-third of German tungsten consumption in 1943.[CITATION-166] Yet, up to mid-1944, a full utilisation of these standby capacities was not considered necessary. Only when it was certain that tungsten imports from the Iberian Peninsula, so far the main foreign source, would stop in the second half of 1944, was a massive capacity expansion of the German tungsten mines ordered. Within a year, total German tungsten production was supposed to increase to 1,200 tons, covering two-thirds of Germany\u2019s consumption needs.[CITATION-167] Combined with the still-existing stocks, German tungsten consumption could have been met up to 1948.[CITATION-168] The nickel mining and refining policy was quite similar. As in the case of tungsten, standby capacities were built up, and the mining output was, as originally scheduled, only slowly increased up to mid-1944.[CITATION-169] In addition, the expansion of standby refineries and the exploration of new mines continued.[CITATION-170] A faster increase of nickel mining was not necessary because Germany had prospective access to the rich Finnish nickel mines in Petsamo from the summer of 1940.[CITATION-171] Nevertheless, in 1943, when the Finnish supply peaked, the war administration prepared a further expansion of the standby capacities; under this scheme the annual German nickel output of 1,100 tons (covering about 15 per cent of Germany\u2019s consumption needs in 1943) could have been doubled immediately and quadrupled by 1946.[CITATION-172] To this end only about an additional hundred workers would have been needed.[CITATION-173] In the spring of 1944, 1.5 million tons of nickel ores with a metal content of 14,000 tons were prepared for mining. Once Germany was cut off from her main nickel supply source in Finland in the summer of 1944, the German war administration accelerated the programme described above and quadrupled the monthly German nickel production between July and October 1944. The plan was to raise German nickel production further to 5,000 tons annually until late 1945; German ores would then have covered 75 per cent of domestic consumption. Combined with the still-existing stocks, German nickel consumption could have been met up to 1948.[CITATION-174] It has been claimed that the increase of mining output started too late, that is, only at the end of the war.[CITATION-175] The implicit assumption of this claim is that an earlier expansion of German mining production would have made metal allocation cuts, such as those implemented for nickel and tungsten, unnecessary. No doubt such cuts did take place, and in some instances\u2014but certainly not always\u2014negatively affected the quality and output of German armaments. For example, scholars note that in summer 1943 armour-piercing ammunition production was suspended in order to conserve tungsten.[CITATION-176] In the same year, the Luftwaffe complained about nickel allocations being too short.[CITATION-177] Yet, considering the size of German stocks at the time, it seems that allocation cuts were dictated neither by an actual metal shortage nor by a delayed expansion of German mining.[CITATION-178] In the case of armour-piercing ammunition, a continuation of production from mid-1943 to mid-1944 would have required only 360 tons of tungsten, leaving Germany with some stocks (about 1,200 tons) once it began to use its tungsten standby capacities.[CITATION-179] With regard to the Luftwaffe, too, there is no indication that the actual nickel allocation was dictated by a metal shortage or by a delayed expansion of German mining.[CITATION-180] In 1943, German nickel stocks were more than 8,000 tons\u2014not much lower than in September 1939. Stocks even slightly increased during the next twelve months. The additional quantity demanded by the Luftwaffe in 1943 cannot have been large\u2014certainly significantly lower than the average nickel consumption of the Luftwaffe during the first three years of the war (around 150 tons per month).[CITATION-181] Anyway, the actual amount of allocation cannot be explained by a real shortage of nickel, especially when considering the German mining potential. This is confirmed by the fact that, in the case of nickel from 1943 onwards (as in the case of copper and tin), the relative share of metals allocated to the companies which was not called up by them increased.[CITATION-182] In other words, there is little indication that decisions to cut allocations during the second half of the war owed much to an immediate or a medium-term shortage; rather, they were the result of an allocation and stockpiling policy which aimed to stretch out Germany\u2019s capacity to wage war under blockade conditions. From 1943 on, the goal of the German tungsten policy was, as the annual plan for 1943 reveals, the expansion of the German stock.[CITATION-183] This stockpiling policy is also confirmed by the decision to continue the very expensive\u2014in terms of workforce required\u2014metal mobilisation measures for copper and tin beyond late 1942, despite the fact that both tin and copper stocks were at this point far bigger than at the beginning of the war.[CITATION-184] This policy was mainly responsible for the fact that by November 1944 German stocks actually exceeded those in September 1939 by 135 per cent (copper) and 150 per cent (tin). This stockpiling policy, expressed in allocation cuts in the case of tungsten and continued metal mobilisation in the cases of copper and tin, probably resulted from the fact that Germany\u2019s strategic outlook had become bleak in the eyes of Albert Speer and the leading Nazis in 1943: from this point on, Germany had to wait for mistakes to be made by the enemy in order to win the war.[CITATION-185] Indeed, whereas the time horizon of German supply plans in the early stage of the war had a duration of three years, 1943 plans had a five-year coverage.In contrast to what has been argued by scholars, the German economic administration actually carried out ample war preparations in the field of non-ferrous metals that were based on the lessons of the Great War, which it had carefully and covertly studied. Given these preparations and considerations, which suggest that Hitler did indeed prepare for a major war, and not for a series of short wars, Germany could expect to sustain a longer war (as long as the Great War) even in the case of a sea blockade. Such a war could not have been endless, of course, but certainly far longer than previously thought. Germany\u00b4s comparatively low metal stocks, combined with high peacetime import dependency, are therefore neither evidence that Hitler did not intend to wage a longer war, nor that the country was not prepared for such a conflict because the war came prematurely or because German pre-war economic administration was incompetent. This article thus refutes one fundamental assumption of the Western powers\u2019 long-war strategy and casts doubt on the conventional wisdom regarding the alleged unpreparedness of Germany for a longer war. To be sure, further sectors that are commonly believed to be weak points of German war preparedness must also be critically re-examined before we can draw general conclusions about Germany\u2019s war preparation and the extent of Hitler\u2019s gamble in 1939.What is clear is that not only historians but also the contemporary intelligence services of the Western powers misjudged Germany\u2019s ability to master the problems of metal supply under a blockade. This misjudgement can be partly attributed to the secretiveness of the Third Reich, which made it difficult to assess the effects of Germany\u2019s pre-war policy. In addition, due to German deception during the inter-war period, the effectiveness of the measures implemented by Imperial Germany during the Great War to overcome the blockade was little known outside Germany. This may explain why the IIC tended to overestimate the effects of the blockade during the Great War.[CITATION-186] Yet, seeing that some quantitative information had been published in Germany immediately after the Great War, which suggested, for instance, the massive effects of substitution and conservation during that conflict,[CITATION-187] the expectations of the Western powers in the late 1930s were at the least overly optimistic.[CITATION-188] In hindsight, the assessment of Archibald Bell, a well-informed contemporary critic of blockade optimism, proved correct. Bell, who authored the official British history of the blockade during the Great War in 1937, did not believe (given the experience of the last war) that a future blockade would have a decisive effect, especially with regard to metals.[CITATION-189] What the German planners had learned from the metal policy of the Great War\u2014especially with regard to the significance of substitution and conservation measures\u2014proved, as the statistics compiled in this article clearly show, to be far more crucial for the German \u2018metal miracle\u2019 during the Second World War than the ruthless plundering of occupied countries\u2019 metal stocks. In this way, Germany\u2019s most important hidden reserve in the field of metals was its scientists: they analysed and categorised their wartime experiences, they carried out substitution research, they tested new production methods, they invested in substitutes, and they modified the construction of manufactures, all in order to reduce consumption. In the cases where shortages existed during the war they were not a result of an actual imminent lack of metals; rather it seems that during the second half of the war they stemmed from the expanding time horizon of the Nazi regime regarding the end of the war, which was a consequence of Germany\u2019s bleak strategic outlook. In short, the German defeat was not the result of a lack of preparation in the 1930s but of the strategic decision to start a war which, as Hitler well knew,[CITATION-190] ran the danger of drawing in an ever more superior coalition of enemies the longer the war lasted. Indeed, if it had been only for non-ferrous metals, Germany could have continued the war for a few more years.Determinants of German metal supply in a future war (metric tons)Sources:BArch, RW 19/2336.

The missing steel data for 1942 II as well as for the quarters from 1943 III to 1944 IV is estimated by multiplying the value of steel components consumed in the ammunition production (USSBS, Effects of Strategic Bombing, p. 283, Appendix, Table 112) by the ratio between the steel consumption and the consumption of steel components in 1942 I and 1943 II respectively.",
