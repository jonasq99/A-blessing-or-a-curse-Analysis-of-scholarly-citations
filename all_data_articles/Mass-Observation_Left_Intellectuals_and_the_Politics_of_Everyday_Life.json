Central to this moment was the social research organisation Mass-Observation, the sociologists of which argued that democracy should be built around the vibrancy and irreverence they identified in ordinary culture. This ambition gained its fullest application during the 1940s, as a number of former M-O researchers became influential in the social reconstruction effort, in Labour Party policy circles and, later, in post-war academic sociology. By tracing the sociological arguments of unaligned left intellectuals from the 1930s to the 1950s, this article emphasises the rich plurality of influences at play within British progressive thought in the mid-twentieth century\u2014influences which spanned the worlds of far-left activism, literature, art, the social sciences, town planning and parliamentary politics. It also helps us to reassess the genesis of the first \u2018New Left\u2019 in 1956. This is often hailed as the moment when British socialists first started to appreciate ordinary culture, freed from political dogmatism. In fact, left intellectuals had been engaging with the politics of everyday life for at least two decades previously. Indeed, the nostalgic accent which some New Left writers placed on the traditional working-class group was but one facet of a more heterogeneous political tradition\u2014one concerned to think beyond \u2018class\u2019 altogether, and to examine how culture operated at the level of the individual.In 1956 the sociologists Michael Young and Edward Shils composed a pamphlet reflecting on \u2018What is Living and What is Dead in Socialism\u2019.[CITATION-1] Young and Shils had frequently been intellectual collaborators over the previous decade but, judging by the many lively annotations inscribed on the personal copy in his private papers, most of the ideological slant of this document came from Young. Indeed, the mid-1950s were a time of political disillusionment for Young. Appointed as director of the Labour Party\u2019s Research Department in 1945, he had drafted the party\u2019s 1945 and 1950 election manifestos, and had played a key role in shaping its policy direction. But Young became increasingly disappointed with what he saw as the intransigence of some of his colleagues, and the seemingly limited capacity of mainstream parliamentary politics to enact radical change. He resigned from his post in 1950, going on to complete a Ph.D. in social policy at the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1952 before setting up a year later the Institute of Community Studies (ICS), a social-research organisation that was concerned with the study of working-class life in London\u2019s East End. The 1956 pamphlet was thus part of Young\u2019s wider attempt to make sense of the past few decades, and to reconcile his troubling recent experiences as a Labour Party policy-maker with his other roles as a left intellectual and a sociologist of everyday life.Young argued that diverse strands of ethical, utopian, religious and idealist thought had all been essential in shaping the outlook of the contemporary British left. Even in the 1930s, he suggested, when many left intellectuals (including Young himself) had developed a sustained engagement with Marxism, and had pledged support to the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), the importance of these \u2018humanitarian\u2019 intellectual influences had prevented the British left from straying too far into dogmatism or crude \u2018economism\u2019.[CITATION-2] By this Young meant that British socialists had never been solely preoccupied with pulling the economic levers of power. They also realised the importance of encouraging diversity, vitality and freedom in the realm of culture\u2014what Young termed the full \u2018liberation of man\u2019s creative power, the fulfilment of his potentialities of expression\u2019. However, Young and Shils warned that this vibrant and intellectually pluralistic aspect of left-wing thought was being slowly eroded by the Labour Party\u2019s growing \u2018ideological doctrinarism\u2019, as leading figures on the left and right of the party clashed in the 1950s over the more narrowly \u2018organisational\u2019 issues of nationalisation and the economy. Young and Shils urged their peers to look beyond these technocratic concerns, encouraging them to think creatively about how to expand and extend both man\u2019s freedom and his capacity to use it. Only these ideas would keep alive the left\u2019s traditional concern with ensuring equality and allowing individuals to \u2018feel more deeply and to create more fruitfully\u2019.[CITATION-3] A range of important historical accounts have broadly echoed this assessment of early to mid-twentieth-century British socialism. Martin Francis has mapped the various \u2018heterogeneous\u2019 influences that shaped British left-wing thought from the 1930s, through the years of the Second World War, and on into post-war planning. He has argued that the British left\u2019s \u2018latitudinarian vision of socialism\u2019 remained highly fluid over this period, but was ultimately always committed to an ethical desire to nurture individual liberty, whilst also bringing about the collectivist common good.[CITATION-4] Stephen Brooke has also emphasised the twentieth-century Labour Party\u2019s flexible and \u2018libertarian\u2019 understanding of socialism.[CITATION-5] Its attempts in the 1940s to match the values of \u2018liberty, pluralism and decentralization\u2019 to a robustly planned economy, for him best expressed in the thought of the economist and Labour MP Evan Durbin, explain many of the ideological tensions which provoked party debates in subsequent years.[CITATION-6] Jeremy Nuttall has also used Evan Durbin\u2019s ideas to illustrate the central dynamics underpinning left-wing thought in the early to mid-twentieth century. He argues that Durbin\u2019s interest in psychology and sociology was employed as part of a wider \u2018multi-dimensional pursuit of equalitylibertyfraternityefficiency\u2019.[CITATION-7] The very idea that these seemingly incompatible values could be reconciled, he continues, highlights the importance of \u2018synthesis\u2019 to British socialism; a credo, Nuttall argues, which has consistently sought to blend strikingly diverse influences in pursuit of its aims.[CITATION-8] Ben Jackson, meanwhile, has drawn together many of these perspectives in his wide-ranging study of the British left\u2019s political thought. Jackson traces how an assortment of progressive thinkers reacted against the economistic Marxism of the Popular Front and Left Book Club circles in the 1930s, looking first to economics and then to sociology and psychology to attain a deeper and more multi-layered understanding of human nature. Their attempts to think beyond class analysis spawned a range of communitarian and social-democratic solutions which flourished over the course of wartime and post-war reconstruction. In particular, a number of intellectuals, including Michael Young, were profoundly influenced by the \u2018solidaristic ethic\u2019 of wartime society.[CITATION-9] Bolstering their arguments with findings derived from post-war sociology, they insisted that the most effective way to forge an egalitarian politics was to protect the mutualistic, co-operative practices that already existed within working-class life, in opposition to the centralising, \u2018hierarchical\u2019 tendencies of the centralised capitalist state.[CITATION-10] All of these accounts, therefore, stress the intellectual syncretism of British socialism. They argue for the importance of ethical and libertarian aspects of left-wing thought, at the expense of narrowly economistic or statist strategies. They foreground the 1940s, and the engagement during that decade with the emergent disciplines of professional sociology and psychology, as crucial for the development of left thought. However, they also tend to focus on the ideological contribution of quite a narrow network of figures. Stephen Brooke pinpoints the \u2018young academics\u2019 and Labour MPs associated with the New Fabian Research Bureau in the 1930s, including Hugh Gaitskell, Evan Durbin, Douglas Jay, Barbara Wootton and James Meade, as vital in helping to forge a libertarian vision of socialist planning throughout the 1940s and 1950s.[CITATION-11] Martin Francis also focuses on a similar milieu, centring his study on an \u2018informal, but still closely interlocked\u2019 grouping of Labour Party-affiliated intellectuals and government ministers.[CITATION-12] Even Ben Jackson, who is concerned to reconstruct the connections between sociological studies of working-class life and broader left thought in the 1940s and 1950s, chiefly concentrates on debates carried out within mainstream Labour currents. This means that, despite their emphasis on intellectual ecumenicalism, these histories can at times appear somewhat self-contained\u2014tracking only how Labour Party policy emerged from within Labour Party ideological circles.To this end, Lise Butler has recently sought to locate more substantively some of the external intellectual influences on the \u2018communitarian and co-operative\u2019 tradition of socialism espoused by Michael Young.[CITATION-13] She argues that the post-war British left\u2019s ethical and \u2018relational\u2019 modes of thinking benefited from a sustained engagement with Anglo-American social psychology, sociology and social anthropology in the 1940s\u2014highlighting Young as a key figure in this transmission. She traces how Young, his sociologist collaborators at the Institute of Community Studies, and his contacts in the Labour Party, utilised various social-scientific ideas concerning the family and individual psychology to develop a \u2018model of socialist citizenship, solidarity and community\u2019.[CITATION-14] This is a highly illuminating intellectual history, which stresses the fluidity of left thought in this period and reinforces existing depictions of Young as an important ideological gatekeeper for the British left through the mid-twentieth century.[CITATION-15] This article, however, contends that the origins of this pluralistic tradition have longer roots, and can be viewed within a slightly different context. It argues that, before mainstream Labour figures developed their libertarian and communitarian approaches to planning in the 1940s, a range of non-aligned left thinkers were articulating similar ideas within the intellectually febrile milieu of the interwar Popular Front. Michael Young, as he acknowledged in his 1956 pamphlet, was part of this moment: he followed what has been described as the British left\u2019s \u2018Marxist turn\u2019 in the 1930s by joining the Holborn branch of the Communist Party and engaging in Labour left activism as president of the London School of Economics Socialist Society.[CITATION-16] But Young also broke quite soon with such party-political commitments. He left these roles in the later 1930s, instead dedicating himself to the study of working-class life through forms of social observation that were not directly connected to party politics. This was not a lone journey, but one that was in fact taken by an important group of thinkers examined in this study. I trace how their adoption of a consciously unaligned \u2018left\u2019 position in the late 1930s brought them into contact with a range of heterodox influences earlier than those who remained active within party structures, and led them to devise a politics devoted primarily to understanding the lives of ordinary people through sociological study.Crucial to this moment was the social-research organisation Mass-Observation (M-O), formed in 1937. Historians have variously examined M-O\u2019s aesthetic, sociological, literary and artistic influences.[CITATION-17] But here I situate the group at the centre of an important political current within British left thought. It led a wider movement\u2014of which Michael Young was a part\u2014towards studying \u2018everyday life\u2019, arguing that politics should be constructed around the insights gleaned from these critical inquiries. This ambition achieved its fullest application during the 1940s, as a number of former M-O researchers became influential in projects of social reconstruction, in Labour Party policy circles and, later, in academic sociology. Throughout, they continued to argue that socialism would only prosper if it paid due respect to the idiosyncratic habits of ordinary people. Unlike the strands of social-democratic thought identified by previous studies, this was a politics grounded first and foremost in the process of interpretative, \u2018bottom-up\u2019 social investigation, rather than articulating anvision of what a socialist society should look like; but it developed alongside these more familiar traditions, contributing to the diverse ideas that shaped British socialism in this period.By tracing the sociological work of unaligned left intellectuals from the 1930s to the 1950s, this article further emphasises the rich plurality of influences at play within British progressive thought in the mid-twentieth century\u2014influences which spanned the various worlds of far-left activism, literature, art, the social sciences, town planning and parliamentary politics. Importantly, I concentrate on the work of thinkers who remained specifically unaffiliated to any political party. Their chosen role allowed them to produce analyses of ordinary culture that were strikingly flexible in their methodological approach. This therefore also helps us to reassess the genesis of the first \u2018New Left\u2019 of the late 1950s, and the birth of cultural studies in the early 1960s. In 1956 a number of Communist Party-affiliated thinkers left the CPGB, breaking with what they saw as the damaging anti-intellectualism of party orthodoxy. They instead embraced a number of interdisciplinary techniques in order to assess contemporary culture, in the hope of founding a politics more closely attuned to the experience of working-class people. Their work is often hailed as the moment when British socialism first started to examine everyday life in its full diversity, freed from the demands of political dogmatism.[CITATION-18] In fact, left intellectuals had been engaging with the politics of everyday life in this way for at least two decades previously. Indeed, as will be shown, the nostalgic accent which New Left writers such as Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams placed on the traditional working-class community was not the sole building block of left thought across this period. It was but one facet of a more heterogeneous political tradition, of which another major animating concern was to think beyond class altogether, and to examine how culture operated at the level of the individual.From the mid-1930s onwards, a number of British left-wing intellectuals began to seek a closer appreciation of the \u2018everyday\u2019 experiences of working people. The(), a Communist Party-affiliated theoretical journal launched in 1934 and edited by Tom Wintringham, Montagu Slater, Amabel Williams-Ellis, Edgell Rickword, Randall Swingler and Alick West, became the \u2018nerve centre\u2019 of this endeavour.[CITATION-19] Along with John Lehmann and Ralph Fox, the editors of the journalthese figures believed that a critical engagement with everyday life, through literature, social observation and art, would act as the democratic \u2018bridge between Communists and fellow travellers and between social classes\u2019 that was required to topple capitalism.[CITATION-20] This was part of a Popular Front-inspired attempt to yoke together a broad coalition of \u2018progressive\u2019 social groupings against both the iniquities of industrial structures and, more pressingly, the threat of fascism.However, a set of much older influences was also marshalled for this urgent task. A literary language of artisanal \u2018craft\u2019\u2014one which drew on the writings of Matthew Arnold and William Morris, and which John Burrow, Stefan Collini and Donald Winch have described as characteristic of British liberalism\u2014was applied to the specific problems generated by modern society.[CITATION-21] In particular, the ability to express one\u2019s individuality was seen as a means of eluding the rigid social categories imposed by capitalist society. The journals published vivid, first-hand tales of working-class experience written by \u2018worker-writers\u2019, which dramatised the apparently unclassifiable nature of everyday existence.\u2019s leading theoreticians believed that capitalism attempted to imprison ordinary people within a monolithic \u2018class\u2019 identity. As Jack Lindsay, ancontributor and prolific political novelist, later explained, \u2018the alienating process (in Marx\u2019s sense)\u2019 stripped workers of their identities. The \u2018struggle against it\u2019 would therefore begin from a creative celebration of individual expression.[CITATION-22] Jack Hilton, a Rochdale plasterer, fireman, and carpenter who had used periods of prolonged unemployment to take up writing, filled his writings with heroes from the margins of capitalist life: tramps, boxers, road-menders, the unemployed, and gypsies.[CITATION-23] Their protean existences demonstrated a heroic ability to survive within, but never because of, society\u2019s strictures.Working-class culture was therefore prized for its romantic, anti-capitalist values. But it was also admired for the solidarity of its institutions. Plebeian spaces such as working-men\u2019s clubs, football grounds and the pub provided the well-established foundations needed to develop spontaneous, egalitarian impulses. As the poet and Communist Party activist Charles Madge articulated, in a poem first published in, the future socialist society would first emerge in the pub, where worker and intellectual would draw together over \u2018The industrial drink, in which my dreams and theirs/ Find common ground\u2019.[CITATION-24] Mass-Observation was formed by Madge and the anthropologist Tom Harrisson in 1937, with the aim of fulfilling the prescription of exploring the dynamics of working-class life. They hoped that studying everyday life would readjust the power balance in British society, which saw a few \u2018men of genius\u2019 ruling through the stifling of public expression.[CITATION-25] As well as contributing pieces to the, Madge published his own Modernist poetry. His work was influenced by I.A. Richards, his tutor at the University of Cambridge, and T.S. Eliot, who acted for a while as his artistic patron. Madge was also involved in the world of British Surrealism, and helped to organise the 1936 Surrealist Exhibition in London. More mundanely, he had worked as a journalist for thein the early 1930s,[CITATION-26] and Madge recalled with fondness the idiosyncratic insights into popular culture which this role had granted him. These cumulative aesthetic and professional influences, each of them concerned with the irreverence and \u2018magic\u2019 to be found within everyday life, ensured that Madge\u2019s political outlook was always much more flexible and amenable to the realm of culture than the \u2018Stalinist orthodoxy\u2019 of which he and his CPGB comrades have been accused.[CITATION-27] Crucially, his relatively unique intellectual formation also led him to be more interested in understanding the mediated forms of culture found within capitalist society than many of hiscolleagues.Over the course of the 1930s Madge grew increasingly dissatisfied with the rather impressionistic depictions of working-class life given by other Popular Front thinkers. This was best illustrated by another of Madge\u2019s interventions in thedebates, his submission to C. Day Lewis\u2019s(1937). This volume was effectively an extendedmanifesto. It featured work by the writers Edgell Rickword, Arthur Calder-Marshall, Edward Upward and Rex Warner, as well as by J.D. Bernal, the socialist scientist, and the Marxist art historian Anthony Blunt.[CITATION-28] Madge\u2019s article, \u2018Press, Radio, and Social Consciousness\u2019, had already appeared in a slightly modified form in.[CITATION-29] What marked it out from the other contributions was its approach to issues of culture. Day Lewis had cast the creative tools needed to challenge the capitalist order in classically bourgeois terms. He poured scorn on theatre and cinema. These were \u2018ludicrously trivial\u2019 and \u2018fatuously pretentious\u2019 mystifications produced to dupe the masses.[CITATION-30] As Rex Warner stated, it was the \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 values of art, literature, and poetry that should be mobilised to write about everyday life.[CITATION-31] Madge, however, rejected this formula. He believed that \u2018high culture\u2019, and in particular fiction, could only offer \u2018an escape into the worlds of wish-fulfilment\u2019.[CITATION-32] Working-class people simply preferred other things; and their culture should thus be examined on its own terms.To this end, Madge and his new M-O colleagues began engaging with social-scientific ideas. M-O\u2019s first publication, which also came out in 1937, featured a section detailing a range of social-psychological, sociological and anthropological \u2018best works\u2019 from which left thinkers could purportedly learn. These included studies carried out by Political and Economic Planning (PEP), The Pilgrim Trust, the Chicago School of sociology, Oscar Oeser\u2019s Social Psychology research group at the University of St Andrews, and the New Fabian Research Bureau.[CITATION-33] There was extended discussion of Robert and Helen Lynd\u2019s Middletown study of Muncie, Indiana, in which the Lynds had employed anthropological, ethnographic and journalistic techniques to probe the \u2018average\u2019 American experience of twentieth-century life.[CITATION-34] Marie Jahoda and Hans Zeisel\u2019s socio-psychological investigation of unemployment in Marienthal, Austria, was also highlighted. Jahoda and her team used oral testimony, participant observation, and statistical sampling to uncover the effects that unemployment had on the wider community.[CITATION-35] As Madge now argued in, these more objective forms of social research could also serve the Popular Front\u2019s political purpose. The empirical study of patterns of leisure, popular pastimes, and the consumption of mass entertainment offered a far more realistic insight into working-class experience. Madge\u2019s initial artistic interest in the popular media thus fed into a wider turn towards the \u2018everyday\u2019 within inter-war sociology, subsequently forming the basis for M-O\u2019s \u2018bottom-up\u2019 description of working-class culture. Non-voters, for example, were analysed as individuals with whole affective worlds rather than as socially aberrant. In fact, they \u2018had as good a reason for not voting as the voter has for using the vote\u2019.[CITATION-36] Gambling, too, was praised as an important \u2018outlet for personal frustration, ambition, and faith\u2019, something which had been \u2018often ignored by opponents\u2019.[CITATION-37] M-O\u2019s findings were politically troubling. Although these activities were popular, they were also consumed on a more individualistic basis and undercut the traditional socialist concept of monolithic class solidarity. Madge, and Mass-Observation, perceived that ordinary life was \u2018stratified into a large number of subtly graded class cultures\u2019, formed around a complex web of associational, economic and individual relations.[CITATION-38] To Madge, this appeared to offer a more accurate understanding of the social world. He argued that social analysis, and subsequent political action, could only \u2018start from an acceptance of the real conditions of experience\u2019.[CITATION-39] Everyday life had to be studied from below, and without any preconceived assumptions about \u2018correct\u2019 class behaviour. This held the key to appreciating working-class experience and, ultimately, advancing social progress.M-O therefore emerged out of a wider debate within 1930s socialism. However, it made a crucial break with this milieu. It corrected the impressionistic valorisations of working-class culture which were otherwise commonplace in the Popular Front-era left. To do so, it left behind explicitly politicised writing, and instead called for a more detached form of social analysis. It argued that every aspect of \u2018everyday life and everynight life\u2019 needed to be examined in a critical, non-judgemental manner, even if this meant considering topics which might initially seem politically disconcerting to socialist intellectuals.[CITATION-40] Mike Savage has claimed that many sociologists in this period remained guided by more patrician forms of social analysis.[CITATION-41] Nonetheless, this left-wing, explicitly \u2018modern\u2019 social science actively sought to break down these older assumptions, and to achieve a more relativistic depiction of culture. Ultimately, however, its desire to create an \u2018instrument\u2019 which might bring about concrete social change was hampered by a lack of funding.[CITATION-42] In fact, by the winter of 1938\u201339 M-O was \u2018close to collapse\u2019, with many of its researchers unpaid, hungry and profoundly disgruntled.[CITATION-43] It was the new opportunities opened up by the extension of the wartime and post-war state that enabled a realisation of M-O\u2019s initial aims.This moment came in the early to mid-1940s, as the course of the war turned in Britain\u2019s favour. Across the political spectrum, thoughts turned to post-war reconstruction. Social researchers were now in demand\u2014and Charles Madge was a notable beneficiary. He had begun investigating the \u2018social factors\u2019 involved in economic decision-making in 1938, using the ethnographic field site that M-O had established in Bolton as his base.[CITATION-44] Although he left M-O in 1940, he continued his project, working at what he called the \u2018fruitful borderland between economics and social research\u2019,[CITATION-45] and his study fed into an investigation of regional spending patterns sponsored by J.M. Keynes and the National Council for Social and Economic Research (NCSER).[CITATION-46] This resulted in a series of articles published in thefrom 1940 to 1941.[CITATION-47] Keynes was eager to gain insights into working-class fiscal habits as he sketched out a new taxation policy, and Madge\u2019s experience in this field now made him a sought-after figure.Madge\u2019s study of distinct financial \u2018cultures\u2019 in Coventry, Bolton, Bristol, Glasgow, and Leeds demonstrated that individuals possessed their own rituals regarding money, which were strongly resistant to external change.[CITATION-48] Nonetheless, they also possessed a strong \u2018practical and empirical\u2019 streak.[CITATION-49] This had come to the fore in the war. Madge used oral testimony to illustrate how ordinary families had complied with household budget constraints, but had reframed them within existing patterns of working-class life. This problematised the vision of class struggle articulated by earlier left-wing figures.had framed itself as the intellectual vanguard needed to lead ordinary people in their inevitable struggle against the capitalist state. But Madge now believed working-class cultures were powerful and creative enough to organise themselves. He argued for a society structured so that the idiosyncratic patterns of social life which he had explored in the regions could be reproduced on a national basis.Michael Young was another left-wing sociologist who benefited from these new opportunities. Before the war Young had initially worked as a solicitor at McKenna and Company, before taking an Economics degree at the LSE, where he attended additional classes in political science, commercial law, and social and economic history.[CITATION-50] At the same time, he also remained active in the world of London grass-roots socialism. There were strong links in the 1930s between the Workers\u2019 Educational Association (WEA), the Labour Party, and local left-wing community projects, with which M-O itself had been involved.[CITATION-51] Young was involved in these endeavours while at the LSE, through his activism with the Communist Party, and as a member of the WEA.[CITATION-52] Young was particularly interested in exploring how the vibrancy of working-class culture might be encouraged. The war effort gave him an ideal opportunity to think this through, as community-based projects such as the WEA were co-opted into the expanded civil defence and military apparatus.[CITATION-53] He founded the state-funded Industrial Discussion Clubs Experiment in 1943, along witheditor Amabel Williams-Ellis and the Marxist art historian Alan Jarvis. These were essentially WEA discussion sessions replicated in a factory setting. As Jarvis later explained, their groups attempted to provide safe spaces where \u2018the real contemporary problems of real people\u2019 might come to the fore.[CITATION-54] In 1939 Young secured a position as a researcher for Political and Economic Planning, the think-tank founded in 1931 by Max Nicholson. He began to study how the new institutions of the wartime state interacted with pre-existing patterns of working-class life, while \u2018carrying out all sorts of welfare work\u2019 in Blitz-era London.[CITATION-55] His findings were presented in a PEP research pamphlet published in 1941 on the management of the wartime social services. Far from destroying them, Young found that the London County Council\u2019s shelter policies had bolstered working-class initiatives. In Bermondsey, co-operation between \u2018the local authority, the ARP organisations, voluntary bodies and representatives of the shelter population\u2019 had produced a flourishing sense of community.[CITATION-56] The council had distributed books and allocated more spaces for civic use. The community in turn used these to organise adult education classes, lead collective reading and wireless groups, and encourage workshops in painting and creative writing. State policy therefore did not \u2018replace\u2019 working-class culture, and could instead \u2018provide new and richer opportunities\u2019 for its development.[CITATION-57] Moreover, it cut across the barriers imposed by socio-economic class. New community schemes helped to foster \u2018unexpected sources of social leadership\u2019, with working-class residents leading their middle-class neighbours in communal activities.[CITATION-58] If properly planned, Young concluded, state policy could be used to allow every individual to have a fair stake in society.The wartime state provided socialist intellectuals with the opportunity to study everyday life at closer hand. Two different strands of thought arose from this. Madge believed that the ingenious working-class cultures he had valorised as acritic, and had carefully charted as an M-O and NCSER-sponsored sociologist, were entirely autonomous. They functioned at a family, and even an individual, level. The state therefore needed to use top-level planning to remove economic inequality, while allowing the free play of working-class individuality to proliferate from the bottom up. Young argued for close, micro-level linkages between local authorities and existing systems of working-class mutualism, in order to bolster an organic communal politics. As he later argued, it was in the kinship group of extended family, and \u2018amongst friends at work, in the pub\u2019 that ordinary people were most themselves; in short, were most individual.[CITATION-59] The state should nurture these resistant spaces within everyday life, using them as the foundation stones on which to construct a true democracy. Madge thus believed that \u2018civic experience\u2019 was constructed out of private habits and customs, expressed at an individual level.[CITATION-60] In contrast, Young argued that people were only most free to express these private desires when in a group, encouraged by the presence of like-minded \u2018fellows\u2019.[CITATION-61] Nonetheless, both agreed that the overriding aim of socialism was to free individuals to behave in diverse ways, even if this contravened certain normative assumptions held by socialist leaders. This had been the driving dynamic of their political careers, ever since the earliest debates at the. A number of historians have suggested that the wartime projects of social reconstruction mobilised the intelligentsia in some way.[CITATION-62] The \u2018collective\u2019 nature of the war, with its emphasis on the sacrifices made by the working class, so it is argued, caused British intellectuals belatedly to veer towards progressivism, without really wishing radically to transform society. This had the consequence that the policies of the Welfare State simply repackaged the paternalistic assumptions of the ruling class, ensuring that a social hierarchy built on \u2018cultural privilege\u2019 remained almost untouched.[CITATION-63] The work of Madge and Young challenges this narrative. These left intellectuals were part of a longer process of attempting to understand everyday life, with intellectual roots stretching much further back into the previous decades. Their engagement was centred less explicitly on \u2018class\u2019 analysis, and was principally concerned with seeking to bolster diversity and individuality within working-class life.By the same token, some historians have suggested that the work of left-wing intellectuals with the wartime state dulled the radical message of Mass-Observation and the Communist milieu from which it emerged.[CITATION-64] But, as we have seen, Madge, Young and their sociologist colleagues had already broken with overtly politicised writing in the 1930s. They had adopted a more flexible \u2018left\u2019 position, and their primary allegiance was to social observation. Collaboration with a range of liberal or centrist social-research projects set up in the 1940s was seen as the best means to further this politics of \u2018everyday life\u2019; but it did not imply outright accommodation with reformist measures. Both Madge and Young offered strikingly critical words when invited by William Beveridge to comment on a draft of hisin 1944.[CITATION-65] They attacked Beveridge\u2019s \u2018idealist\u2019 approach, arguing that the policies of social amelioration he proposed could never be achieved in a capitalist society chained to motives of \u2018prosperity\u2019 and greed.[CITATION-66] These left intellectuals therefore continued to articulate a systemic critique of capitalism that was very similar in nature to the 1930s Communist Party analysis; however, they now believed that a truly democratic politics could only emerge from sustained study of popular culture.The strategic differences between Madge and Young\u2019s own ideological positions were largely brushed over in the period of wartime reconstruction in the mid-1940s. Instead, they concentrated on presenting sociological work which underlined the creativity of everyday life., a journal of contemporary criticism founded by Madge in 1945, became an important vehicle for this critical sociology. The former Mass-Observation researchers Peter Hunot, Bill Naughton, Diana Murray-Hill, Dennis Chapman, Priscilla and Henry Novy, and John Atkins were all contributors, as was the co-founder of M-O, Tom Harrisson. Published over the course of the subsequent two years, the journal sought to bridge disciplinary divides, by drawing together literary criticism, economics, history, and ethnography to produce a \u2018total\u2019 sociology of ordinary life, such as M-O had been founded to achieve a decade earlier.[CITATION-67] A particularly successful example of this methodology was the photojournalistic study of suburban life produced by Peter Hunot and the photographer Arnold Behr. Hunot remained an energetic activist for civil liberties throughout his life, and was part of the conscientious objection movement during the Second World War. He also carried out a number of social surveys with Mass-Observation in the 1940s.[CITATION-68] He was specially commissioned by Charles Madge to produce the report on Britain\u2019s growing suburbia, which featured in the November 1946 edition of. It presented a non-judgemental account of life in Clarence Crescent, a London County Council estate of 87 prefabs in the borough of Wandsworth.[CITATION-69] Hunot\u2019s piece was based on research that he had initially carried out during the war, largely while a tenured Mass-Observer;[CITATION-70] the opportunities provided by post-war social reconstruction enabled him to revisit his sociological findings and reflect on their wider cultural and political meanings.In his study, Hunot wanders around the estate in the classic style of the \u2018form he cites as an influence.[CITATION-71] He introduces a number of media in order to deepen his account of suburban life. He chats with inhabitants, overhears lively, jumbled conversations, and filters in descriptive passages of the neighbourhood landscape, all interspersed with Behr\u2019s photography.[CITATION-72] The effect is very similar to E. Wright Bakke\u2019s thesis, published in 1933, on the \u2018unemployed men\u2019 of South-East London. Influenced by nineteenth-century English social observation, as well as Chicago School sociology, Bakke used impressionistic description, oral testimony, and stylised \u2018observed\u2019 vignettes to achieve a more subjective and \u2018human\u2019 account of everyday life.[CITATION-73] The resemblance to the work of Bakke is particularly evident in Hunot\u2019s treatment of household objects. Bakke had described how the many different \u2018brightly polished door-knobs, letter slot covers, and in some cases name-plates\u2019 he found on neighbourhood doors all carried complex socio-symbolic meanings.[CITATION-74] Similarly, Hunot notes how the way in which each home is furnished is expressive of a sense of independence, evoking the ornaments, red-ochred concrete door slabs, second-hand pianos, polished doorknockers, and the brightly-coloured and carefully cultivated flower arrangements he encounters during his meanderings.[CITATION-75] These idiosyncratic objects highlight the ingenuity of working-class individuals. Hunot\u2019s household pen-portraits connected these sociological techniques to an enduring aim of the British left. By writing a deeper sociology of everyday life, he was aiming to think beyond crude categories of \u2018class\u2019 and to gain a heightened appreciation of working-class experience. A monolithic, class-based understanding of culture mattered far less than individual taste.Hunot\u2019s piece concentrates primarily on its descriptive task. Nevertheless, its ideological roots are undeniable. The study is underpinned by strong cultural and political argument. While Bakke\u2019s work had been an investigation into the socio-psychological effects of unemployment and its arguments had been directed at political leaders and policy-makers, Hunot, by contrast, wanted to make a precise socio-political statement. He wrote to correct the many cynical accounts of council-estate, and by extension working-class, life which pervaded the period. Many public left-wing intellectuals, such as George Orwell and J.B. Priestley, held ambiguous views on Britain\u2019s emerging suburbia. Their political writing had celebrated the traditions of English everyday life, arguing that its sympathetic egalitarianism could be used to construct a progressive national collective.[CITATION-76] The newly privatised cultures apparent on suburban estates\u2014municipal as well as private\u2014seemed threatening to these civic values. Although he spoke of its \u2018essentially democratic\u2019 nature, Priestley in particular remained deeply ambivalent about the \u2018new England\u2019.[CITATION-77] Council estates eroded social inequality and deprivation; but their homogeneous character was also \u2018lacking in zest, in gusto, flavour, bite, drive, originality\u2019. Consequently, Priestley feared that traditional working-class culture was being swept away by homogeneity and Americanisation, by \u2018something a bit too cheap ... a trumpery imitation of something not very good even in the original\u2019.[CITATION-78] Hunot\u2019s irreverent description of working-class habits challenged this pessimism. Council estates could be more than mere laboratories for a new kind of dull equality. The myriad ways in which people decorated their homes showed that they were in the process of re-making their new surroundings.[CITATION-79] There was more than \u2018sufficient talent\u2019 within Clarence Crescent\u2019s populace to organise a lively civic life, should they wish to do so.[CITATION-80] For now, however, the great trauma of war meant that people were \u2018content\u2019 to remain \u2018individualist\u2019. This in itself was not a \u2018fatal deficiency\u2019. Working-class desires, Hunot argued, were fluid: \u2018people like to be sociallike to be away from the surveillance of other people interested in their activities\u2019.[CITATION-81] Just as Clarence Crescent\u2019s residents had adorned their interiors in inventive ways, they would come to develop an authentic suburban culture.Hunot even played a neat literary trick with the reader, interjecting his own sense of cultural dislocation into the narrative. This displayed the friction between working-class culture as lived, and as incorrectly imagined by observers. When visiting one of Clarence Crescent\u2019s homes, he declares himself to be \u2018shocked to be confronted\u2019 by a rather incongruous \u2018life-size model of a black and white spaniel dog made of porcelain\u2019.[CITATION-82] Hunot cannot understand how or why it is sitting on an otherwise conservatively-outfitted suburban kitchen table. Rather than seeking to compress such an object into a rigid sociological framework, Hunot lets his discursive incomprehension speak for itself. Working-class life, he implies, is so rich that the words of a middle-class sociological researcher cannot do it justice. As Michael Young argued, even the most sympathetic attempts to \u2018capture\u2019 a sense of working-class \u2018spirit\u2019 would be \u2018stultified by the very slipperiness of their quarry\u2019.[CITATION-83] Hunot was using his sociology to articulate an idea that had grown increasingly significant within left-wing intellectual circles over the previous decade. Thecoterie had used literary techniques to describe the potency of working-class experience. Their impressionistic approach was forceful, but brushed over exactly how and why ordinary people expressed themselves. Hunot stated his arguments in more measured, sociological terms. This allowed him to demonstrate how working-class individuals acquired, arranged, and rearranged material culture in a variety of ingenious ways. His overriding intention was to show that, given adequate resources, ordinary people could and would build their own cultures for themselves.Peter Hunot was thus working to fulfil M-O\u2019s founding aim. He wanted to write a sociology which encapsulated working-class diversity, and challenged the stereotypical accounts of everyday life produced by out-of-touch politicians and intellectuals. His work therefore demonstrates the important continuities which existed between the socialist debates of the 1930s and the period of post-war reconstruction. It also illustrates that a more libertarian conceptualisation of socialism was not necessarily discovered by post-war Labour revisionists, but was a more continuous tradition rooted in social observation. Finally, it therefore also highlights that a belief in individuality and diversity was an enduring theme of left-wing thinking in this period, and was more significant to twentieth-century British socialism than has previously been appreciated.As the Labour government began to build its New Jerusalem between 1945 and 1951, the political context shifted. The newly installed Socialist government appeared ready to enact radical reform, and so the task was now to consider how society could best nurture working-class individuality in practice. Charles Madge summed this up in the introduction to the April 1946 edition of: the \u2018next challenge\u2019 for the left was to analyse how individual desires could be combined with \u2018the activities of people in groups and in the mass\u2019.[CITATION-84] Michael Young swiftly rose to the position of Secretary and then Director of PEP, often recruiting figures he had worked with in the 1930s as his employees. Charles Madge joined the organisation in 1941, as did the one-time Mass-Observers Kathleen Box and Priscilla and Henry Novy. Articulating an outlook of \u2018hopeful Leftism\u2019, PEP\u2019s task, according to Young, was to succeed in \u2018reconciling planning with democracy\u2019.[CITATION-85] Its research officers sought to ensure that the model of planned growth emerging in Britain did not efface the ingenuity of working-class culture. In 1945, Young was also appointed as the Director of the Labour Party\u2019s Research Department, almost immediately overseeing the completion of the party\u2019s 1945 election-winning manifesto. He went on to spend six years with the Research Department.[CITATION-86] Young was enthusiastic about this role, hailing his position as a \u2018new outlet\u2019 for his brand of democratic socialism.[CITATION-87] By being able to influence Labour politics from within, he hoped that his insights, and those of his sociological colleagues, would help the government to develop a \u2018comprehensive national plan\u2019 to confront the \u2018questions of outstanding public importance\u2019 in a democratic way.[CITATION-88] One of Young\u2019s key collaborators at PEP was Fran\u00e7ois Lafitte, another former Communist Party activist.[CITATION-89] Like Young, Lafitte had spent the early 1940s observing the systems of social organisation which had sprung up in wartime. He authored a stirring critique of the forced detainment of refugees from Nazi Germany, which was published as a best-selling \u2018Penguin Special\u2019 in 1940. In it, he employed populist reportage, investigative policy analysis and oral testimony in an attack on the \u2018whittling away\u2019 of \u2018the traditional civil rights of British citizens\u2019.[CITATION-90] Together, Young and Lafitte began working out how to plan society in order to bolster these personal liberties. They believed that the growing \u2018Bigness\u2019 of society was changing the way in which politics worked, now that the nation was increasingly cross-cut by new linkages propelled by the expansion of industry and finance.[CITATION-91] Consequently, power, Young argued, was becoming increasingly fragile, as traditional parliamentary decision-making was challenged by the international systems of the world economy.[CITATION-92] But such change was nothing new to workers. Industrial society had spent the past 150 years \u2018tossing\u2019 them in a relentless \u2018sea of change\u2019;[CITATION-93] and, in response, ordinary people had developed a \u2018very ancient\u2019 tradition of defiantly clubbing together with their \u2018fellow workers\u2019.[CITATION-94] They had built unions, working-men\u2019s clubs and co-operatives, carving out spaces for more fraternal instincts amid the unfriendliness of unfettered capitalism. Now, in an epoch of further destabilising change, these systems of mutualism, with their historic roots, offered a solid foundation upon which to organise society.However, Young was quick to explain that this was by no means a yearning for some kind of \u2018misty\u2019 collectivist past.[CITATION-95] To illustrate his point, he reinterpreted the early writings of Karl Marx, particularly theMarx had written that capitalism reduced people to the value of their labour, trapping them within a fixed social identity. A man became \u2018a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic\u2019, and was forced to \u2018remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood\u2019.[CITATION-96] This was even more true of the increasingly complex world of the mid-twentieth century, with its \u2018vast division of labour\u2019.[CITATION-97] The working-class spaces that Young and Lafitte identified were resistant to this division of labour. An evening spent at the working-men\u2019s club did not force one to assume any particular identity. To paraphrase Marx, this meant that in working-class communities man was theoretically free to hunt, fish, herd, or criticise as he pleased; in fact he could do all four at once, should he wish. Crucially, he could do so openly, without ever becoming ensnared within a specific social category. Young and Lafitte believed that working-class culture produced a set of authentically socialist values, within which \u2018the individual mattered\u2019 and his \u2018self-respect\u2019 was supported by the wider \u2018community commune\u2019.[CITATION-98] Reformers needed to harness these activities, and to transform them into a national politics.However, the role of the group was above all prized because it enabled people to be more \u2018individual\u2019. Indeed, the importance of individual self-expression to this strand of British socialism was evident in the rather different vision of the socialist collective posited by Charles Madge, and some of the former Mass-Observers whose writing he cultivated at. Madge\u2019s break with the Communist Party thinkers he had aligned himself with in the 1930s stemmed from his dissatisfaction with what he regarded as their monolithic vision of working-class culture. In his 1938 \u2018Drinking in Bolton\u2019 poem Madge had written in praise of the pub not because of its symbolic \u2018working-class\u2019 identity. The pub was special because it was a material space which facilitated personal interaction, free from social stricture. \u2018He\u2019 and \u2018they\u2019 shared a drink; but they did so while remaining individuals. In fact, Madge argued, the idea that shared experience automatically replaced individuality, and bound people together as a \u2018collective\u2019, was fundamentally anti-democratic.This was a defence of individualism which was rather different in accent from the one proposed by Michael Young. Young, and Lafitte, believed that the communal spaces within working-class life offered the protection needed to enable individuals to express themselves. Madge in contrast argued that cultural diversity was already in existence. It was apparent all around, in the creative ways in which ordinary people engaged with popular commerce and with mass entertainment. It was therefore \u2018community\u2019 that needed to be created. The state should structure society in such a way as to remove all economic barriers to the freedom of expression, but individuals would make socialism, from the ground up. As a result, Madge viewed rising affluence, or rather, the possibility of rising affluence, as the most important phenomenon of the twentieth century. He argued that it was a potentially democratic development: as more and more people gained access to the market, they would be equipped with new tools through which to express themselves. The rise of working-class incomes \u2018above subsistence level\u2019 had put them on a par with their autocratic leaders, and \u2018emancipated\u2019 people to express themselves in new ways\u2014an act which challenged the old capitalist power structures.[CITATION-99] featured a number of ethnographies which discussed working-class consumption. Perhaps most successful among them was the imaginative portrait of a \u2018spiv\u2019 produced by the ex-Mass-Observer Bill Naughton in 1945.[CITATION-100] Naughton was a Co-operative Society coal-lorry driver from Bolton. He had encountered M-O before the war, at its Bolton-based \u2018Worktown\u2019 field site.[CITATION-101] Naughton was an aspiring writer, who would go on to pen the novel(1962), which became(1966), the celebrated film starring Michael Caine.[CITATION-102] He had been attracted to M-O by the opportunity to observe and describe the experience of \u2018his\u2019 world; now, he wanted to draw on these observations to offer a political statement on working-class culture.The spiv, introduced by Madge as \u2018as significant in his way as a bishop, a film star or a millionaire\u2019, was indicative of the new kind of hybrid identity thrown up by emerging working-class affluence.[CITATION-103] Naughton\u2019s spiv still embodies the values of freedom and vitality valued by left-wing worker-writers in the 1930s. Indeed, he closely resembles some of Jack Hilton\u2019s protean heroes. Naughton\u2019s protagonist is a lorry boy, whose roving lifestyle closely models the \u2018outlaw\u2019 existences described by Hilton. His travels around the country, chatting, drinking, and womanising, exude a heroic masculinity. He \u2018seldom applies himself to the job\u2019, preferring to \u2018behave crude and tough with girls\u2019, usually with a \u2018successful\u2019 outcome. He appears \u2018mentally quicker than most young men\u2019, using this dexterity to elude recriminations from reproachful bosses and vengeful, cuckolded husbands.[CITATION-104] Naughton used first-hand testimony, rendered in a scattergun South London argot, to highlight his character\u2019s incessant energy.Naughton and Madge might have seemed to be valuing a type of working-class ingenuity that did not differ greatly from that of Hilton\u2019s early 1930s writings. However, this working-class ebullience was now expressed through novel means. Whereas Hilton\u2019s heroes had been drenched in the sweat of working-class toil, Naughton\u2019s spiv was far more likely to be doused in a liberal sprinkling of the latest French cologne.[CITATION-105] He was a \u2018big city product\u2019, far slicker and more savvy than the grimy figures from the industrial North who had filled the output of the worker-writers of the 1930s. The spiv\u2019s individuality was expressed through the creative way by which he consumed commercial products. He out-dazzled his dowdy-looking colleagues by \u2018never owning fewer than four good quality suits\u2019. He confounded the uptight middle-class clients he encountered on his travels by \u2018always\u2019 turning up to work in one, combined with suede shoes, a gleaming white collar, and the obligatory \u2018flashy jewellery\u2019. He wore these nominally middle-class products in a defiantly working-class way, carrying them off with a \u2018whole little cocky attitude\u2019.[CITATION-106] In Naughton\u2019s account, it is the spiv himself who provides the most accurate summary of his cultural make-up. He forcefully states that \u2018there\u2019s nothing worse than a bloke who tries wearing a fancy cut of clothes but hasn\u2019t got the touch off\u2019.[CITATION-107] Buying and possessing clothes and jewellery had become a means of expressing one\u2019s personality. Ordinary people now had an even more democratic tool to stage their identities, through mass capitalism. Madge believed that working people should be given adequate material opportunities to bolster these inventive cultures. The state needed to use top-level planning to remove economic and social barriers to consumption. This would fully allow people to meet and interact together within society, finding democratic \u2018common ground\u2019\u2014just as Madge and the workers had while \u2018Drinking in Bolton\u2019 almost a decade earlier.[CITATION-108] Many contemporary left-wing analysts, however, viewed affluence with trepidation. Lawrence Black and Stuart Middleton have charted the ambivalence with which both leading Labour Party figures and the rank-and-file viewed working-class consumption.[CITATION-109] Similarly, Richard Hornsey has argued that the \u2018bourgeois morality\u2019 of post-war planners was troubled by the \u2018ineffable fluidity\u2019 of figures with liminal class or sexual identities. In this way, Naughton\u2019s character of the spiv, and his \u2018exaltation\u2019 of \u2018frivolity and fashion\u2019, clashed with social democracy\u2019s faith in planned \u2018progress and stability\u2019.[CITATION-110] But Madge, and the writers he cultivated at, attempted to reconcile irreverence and acquisitiveness with egalitarianism. In so doing, Madge was prefiguring the work of the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, and the rich portrayals of working-class cultural life that it produced from the 1960s onwards. As Madge showed, ordinary people enjoyed indulging in a wide variety of leisure activities, many of which were based around the material culture of capitalist society. This did not mean they were suffering from false consciousness; instead, rising incomes served to reinforce the ingenuity of working-class expression.These different sociological responses to post-war reconstruction chimed with a number of strands of Labour Party thought. Ben Jackson has argued that we should move away from characterising the Labour Party in the 1940s and 1950s as divided by what he believes to be the \u2018overrated\u2019 economic argument between left-wing \u2018Bevanites\u2019 (the proponents of wholesale nationalisation) and right-wing \u2018Gaitskellite\u2019 revisionists (the advocates of Keynesian demand management). Instead, he has suggested that the most significant division in this period was between those thinkers who conceived of socialism solely as the \u2018egalitarian distribution of material goods\u2019, and those who believed it should also comprise the \u2018older ambition\u2019 of encouraging more \u2018co-operative and fraternal social attitudes\u2019.[CITATION-111] Jackson traces the complex roots of these ideological fault lines, highlighting the importance of contemporary sociology, psychology and longer-rooted ethical versions of socialism. To these diverse origins, we can also add the critical investigations of everyday life which emerged from the Popular Front in the 1930s, and were honed through social research in the wartime and post-war reconstruction effort.Indeed, in the late 1940s and 1950s both Young and Lafitte advanced their ideas in discussions within the Labour Party Socialist Union grouping. Young was notably influential within this circle, discussing ideas and providing policy suggestions to Anthony Crosland, Hugh Gaitskell, Evan Durbin, Rita Hinden and Richard Crossman.[CITATION-112] Young\u2019s thought, particularly as expressed in(1958), was interpreted in two divergent ways. His faith in the working-class collective, expressed most forcefully in, which he published with Peter Willmott in 1957, appealed to figures on the Labour left such as Crossman, and later communitarian thinkers of the New Left.[CITATION-113] But his proposals to release this untapped reservoir of working-class \u2018talent\u2019 by restructuring Britain\u2019s \u2018caste society\u2019 were read differently.[CITATION-114] Revisionist thinkers such as Crosland and Gaitskell took his writings as vindication of the idea that socialism\u2019s first task should be to temper the sharper edges of capitalist society, adapting it to fit the new demands of ordinary people. Crosland argued that he wanted to grant Young\u2019s assertive working class the opportunity to escape \u2018the bottom\u2019 and \u2018rise to the top\u2019.[CITATION-115] Young never accepted that socialism was simply about enabling people to \u2018rise up in the world by light of any mathematical measure\u2019.[CITATION-116] Nonetheless, this link between Young and figures such as Crosland allows us to reconfigure how we view the socio-economic arguments which later formed the revisionist credo. While some have suggested that the revisionists wanted entirely to bury the idea of class,[CITATION-117] in the case of figures such as Young, we can see that their concern was an attempt to revise one-dimensional, massifying conceptions of working-class culture, and to advance a politics that respected the individualist traditions found within everyday life. This is very different from denying the existence of \u2018class\u2019 altogether. In fact, a link can be traced between these discussions and those first held around the Communist Party in the inter-war period. It is also important to recognise that the more \u2018traditional\u2019 Labour left and the right-wing revisionists were both engaging with Young\u2019s sociological arguments. This debate regarding the future direction of social democracy had longer, more substantive roots than is generally appreciated, which stretched back to the intellectual developments of the 1930s and 1940s.Nonetheless, many of the former M-O researchers were frustrated by the limited scope for reconstruction which Labour politics afforded, and by their experience of formal political office more generally. Madge was appointed Social Development Officer of Stevenage New Town in 1947. He later recalled the \u2018frustration\u2019 he felt when he was told there was only sufficient money for 75 staff members, rather than the 5,000 he claimed that he had been promised.[CITATION-118] Madge felt that he had acquired a sophisticated understanding of \u2018what pre-war legislators used to call the \u201cworking classes\u201d\u2019, and how they lived and interacted together.[CITATION-119] But his experiences in Stevenage highlighted the large gap between his dreams and Treasury reality; a disjuncture which Madge could not help but \u2018find more sad than funny\u2019.[CITATION-120] Moreover, there remained the possibility that working-class people simply did not want to be planned for. The last page of Madge\u2019s(1943) had summed up these tensions.[CITATION-121] The text is one of a number of \u2018plans\u2019 Madge published in the mid-1940s. He struggled to sketch out a post-war framework which could match strong economic growth with cultural diversity. The book is filled with prescriptions for reorganising industry along fairer and more efficient lines, and yet the very viability of these plans is knowingly questioned by Madge\u2019s choice of the cover inset photograph. A workman peacefully snoozes on his building site. He seems unmoved by the busy schemes for reconstruction which fill the pages of the book. Emphasising this point, a copy of J.C. Smuts\u2019ssits apparently unread on his chest.[CITATION-122] The message is clear: the diverse and determinedly independent hopes and dreams of ordinary people, which formed the focus of Madge\u2019s sociological analysis, had to be accounted for in public policy-making. But this same independence forcefully contested the idea that the working classes either wanted or needed their habits to be \u2018planned\u2019 into existence.By the later 1940s, however, fears of the suffocating impact of planning seemed to be becoming a reality. In 1947, Michael Young warily noted the \u2018disillusionment of many formerly enthusiastic supporters of the Labour Party\u2019. He was worried that \u2018right-wing authoritarian elements\u2019 would marshal the middle class behind some kind of extra-parliamentary, quasi-Fascist movement.[CITATION-123] Leo Kuper\u2019s 1953 study of ninety households in Coventry, to which Madge provided the foreword, found that many inhabitants hated the \u2018blueprint for living together\u2019 which post-war planners had attempted to impose on them.[CITATION-124] These findings highlighted the unparalleled political and social polarisation which marked the period.[CITATION-125] The Conservatives launched a strongly partisan campaign against the Labour Party\u2019s \u2018post-war settlement\u2019, attacking its supposed profligacy, bureaucracy, and authoritarianism. Large elements of the middle class turned against the government, rejecting its redistributive policies as favouring the \u2018special interests\u2019 of its working-class constituents.[CITATION-126] In turn, the transition to nationalisation also fostered rising industrial militancy, and brooding resentment between rank-and-file trade unionists and central government.[CITATION-127] These developments served as a warning to political planners that they would never truly be able to speak for the people. Young too became increasingly disenchanted with organised politics. As the late 1940s degenerated into bitter political and social conflict, he became frustrated by his inability to push forward progressive political change, and by what he perceived as the conservatism of his colleagues in the Labour Party Research Department. His radical suggestions for \u2018workers\u2019 control\u2019, elaborated in the pamphlet(1948), were rejected by both Ernest Bevin and Herbert Morrison.[CITATION-128] As the report was replaced with a more staid second edition, which he completely disowned, Young feared that he was becoming \u2018out of touch\u2019 with the ordinary people he hoped to serve.[CITATION-129] These tensions are evident in some of his drafts of(1948) and his unpublished collection of essays \u2018For Richer, For Poorer: Essays on Family, Community, and Socialism\u2019 (1952).is the most important statement of his political vision that Young made while he was still a Labour Party employee. The work was officially published as a Labour Party pamphlet in 1949, and sees Young grappling with what he presents as the \u2018great dilemma of modern society\u2019: the challenge of reconciling localised social democracy with the economic demands for large-scale decision-making.[CITATION-130] In the published text, Young remains loyal to the hope that socialism will resolve this problem. However, the draft copies held within his papers are filled with scorn for political leaders, and their belief that \u2018the town planners and architects have the magic wands in their hands\u2019.[CITATION-131] Young\u2019s thought was increasingly marked by the strong class polarity that he felt was re-making British society, and he was increasingly pessimistic that middle-class reformers would ever be able to plan for the working class. These statements were removed for publication. By the early 1950s, these frictions were laid bare. \u2018For Richer, For Poorer\u2019 was the last policy document that Young presented to the Party, and the latent disquiet ofwas fully unleashed. Seeing his proposals for localised and participatory democracy rejected, Young now believed that top-level government was doomed forever to remain aloof from working-class experience.He left his Labour Party post shortly afterwards, to undertake his Ph.D. at the LSE under the supervision of Richard Titmuss, before founding the Institute of Community Studies with Peter Willmott.[CITATION-132] Madge too left organised politics, becoming the first Chair of Sociology at Birmingham University in 1950. Lafitte joined Madge, becoming Chair of Social Policy and Administration at Birmingham in 1959, while Young recruited Madge as a member of his ICS advisory board in 1957. Basing itself in East London, the ICS hoped to investigate the patterns of working-class life which politicians simply did not understand. Young envisaged(1957), the most famed product of the work of the ICS, as a sustained attack on out-of-touch politicians. He believed that \u2018man\u2019s deepest needs\u2019 were not being adequately encapsulated by contemporary policy.[CITATION-133] The ICS has often been critiqued for producing idealisations of \u2018traditional\u2019 working-class culture, which reflected the over-mythologised understanding of class which persisted within strands of the British left in this period.[CITATION-134] But this is to neglect the experiences that had formed Young\u2019s worldview. Young\u2019s over-valuation of certain aspects of working-class life\u2014notably the power of community and the enduring ties of family\u2014was explicitly and self-consciously derived from his experiences as a contributor to the project of post-war reconstruction.[CITATION-135] It was a politicised attempt to call for greater local democracy, and for more power to be devolved from the central state to ordinary citizens. Young, like his fellow participants in sociological investigations in the 1930s, still wanted to free people at an individual level; but the means of achieving this had simply changed over the years. Although the travails of the post-war period had given a greater saliency to group forms of organisation such as community, kinship, and family, the principal focus of the ICS\u2019s work remained its wish to uncover the individual \u2018detail of people\u2019s lives\u2019.[CITATION-136] Both Ross McKibbin and Mike Savage have argued that the years after 1945 saw the rapid degeneration of social democracy as it was abandoned by disillusioned middle-class progressives and half-hearted \u2018reformist\u2019 intellectuals during the crisis years of the late 1940s.[CITATION-137] Indeed, much the same was argued by contemporary New Left critics, who believed that the turn away from the Labour government by the middle class demonstrated the foolishness of pursuing anything other than a strongly socialist and class-based form of politics.[CITATION-138] The case of Michael Young and his sociologist colleagues shows that the dichotomous narrative of the \u2018rise and fall\u2019 of post-war social democracy cannot be entirely accepted. These intellectuals stepped away from party politics through conscious choice, frustrated by its limited potential to enact radical social change. But they did not renounce their convictions wholesale. Instead they took them onwards into professional sociology, in the hope that from there they could reshape politics. This was not surprising for a group of intellectuals whose primary commitment, from the very beginning of their careers, had always been to the sociological investigation of working-class life. Indeed, the work they produced as sociologists in the 1950s built up an important intellectual resource for the left, as it continued to examine how public policy could be more closely related to everyday life.In 1957, the socialist historian Raphael Samuel perceived that a \u2018New Left\u2019 had arisen over the past decade. He pinpointed three important strands of thought which had emerged since the early 1950s, and which in his view would re-energise the socialist movement: the cultural criticism of Raymond Williams, Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall; the socialist theory provided by E.P. Thompson and John Saville; and the sociological investigations of ordinary life undertaken by the LSE sociologists Richard Titmuss, Peter Townsend and Brian Abel-Smith\u2014whom Young, Madge and Samuel himself had worked with at the ICS. All of these thinkers were drawn together by an interest in working-class culture, and a desire to forge a politics more closely attuned to the everyday habits of ordinary people.[CITATION-139] Despite Samuel\u2019s optimism, however, the shared concern with \u2018everyday life\u2019 failed to bring these camps together in the way that he hoped.The intellectuals who formed the two key New Left journals,and, did so in the hope of reviving the creative \u2018Marxism of the thirties\u2019, which they felt had since been \u2018extinguished\u2019 by the Cold War and the coming of the affluent society. They hoped to encourage socialist feeling within \u2018everyday life\u2019, seeing this as the best way of overcoming the \u2018gigantic problems\u2019 facing modern society.[CITATION-140] Distinctively \u2018class\u2019-based forms of culture were to be the starting-point for a renewed revolutionary politics\u2014which was particularly urgent given the flight of intellectuals from the Communist Party of Great Britain in wake of its continued support for Stalinist Soviet Russia. Michael Young and his ICS colleagues had also come to place greater emphasis on the role of the working class. But they had arrived at this position from a different route. They did not want to reignite class politics as an end in itself. Instead, over the course of the 1940s and 1950s, they had come to see the complex networks of community which characterised working-class neighbourhoods as the best mechanisms for protecting individual freedoms amid the rapid political, economic and social change re-making modern Britain. This different accent, on \u2018community\u2019, \u2018family\u2019 and the \u2018individual\u2019 alongside, or even at times over, \u2018class\u2019, caused friction between the ICS sociologists and their younger New Left colleagues.Important methodological divisions also hindered full intellectual collaboration between these different perspectives. In particular, the younger Marxist New Left figures were sceptical of sociology, regarding its vision of society as too \u2018static\u2019. Peter Worsley, for example, strongly criticised the \u2018facile optimism\u2019 of both Mass-Observation and the ICS. He argued that their \u2018super-empiricist\u2019 descriptions of micro-level cultural formation failed to encapsulate the more \u2018complex processes\u2019 at play within working-class life, which only a Marxian approach could capture.[CITATION-141] Richard Hoggart, in a review of Mass-Observation\u2019s work, argued that \u2018objective\u2019 sociological investigation failed to capture the imaginative \u2018life and meanings\u2019 beyond everyday occurrences.[CITATION-142] Moreover, it was tarred by the influence of what Charles Taylor called the \u2018piecemeal\u2019 reformism of the hated revisionists, with whom many of the sociological intellectuals had been associated.[CITATION-143] Therefore, despite a shared concern with the \u2018everyday\u2019 and its relation to democratic socialist politics, there was remarkably little intellectual co-operation between the thinkers of the New Left and their sociological counterparts.This had the consequence that the inventive, relativistic take on culture which had marked, for example, the best of Charles Madge\u2019spublications, was sidelined. New Left figures became increasingly preoccupied with romanticising \u2018class\u2019 as a group experience, but often forgot that class was experienced in a variety of different ways. E.P. Thompson, for example, was at best sceptical about any form of activism which differed from the class politics that he knew and understood. In a brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of contemporary protest movements, Thompson denied that the \u2018Dope-addicts and \u201cBeats\u201d, stilyagi, gang conflicts and race riots\u2019 which appeared to be challenging the ruling order were anything more than \u2018anti-political nausea\u2019 suffered by \u2018inarticulate\u2019 youths.[CITATION-144] Stuart Hall, too, although more open to the new cultural forms of jazz and skiffle, ultimately believed them to be a modified form of the \u2018commodity fetishism\u2019 suffered by an increasingly \u2018status\u2019-obsessed working class.[CITATION-145] Thompson and Hall, like many of their New Left colleagues, were bound to a vision of \u2018correct\u2019 class behaviour. This caused them to miss the ways in which people behaved beyond class\u2014and to forget that encouraging these heterogeneous forms of expression had been a central aim of the British left. This increasingly pushed sociological insights out of the leftist fold, with the consequence that subsequent historians have come to see the New Left\u2019s variant of socialist thought as indicative of all left-wing debate in the post-war years. However, as this article has sought to demonstrate, the New Left did not discover the fertility of working-class culture. A number of left thinkers, who began their careers in the circles around Mass-Observation, and who took their analyses onwards into various spheres of debate in the 1940s and 1950s, had been engaging with everyday life for at least two decades prior to the foundation of theand the.Acknowledging the importance of this form of social observation refines our understanding of the intellectual development of the mid-twentieth-century British left. It helps to recover the range of sociological and political influences which developed over the course of the 1930s and 1940s, resonated with aspects of Labour thought in the period of post-war reconstruction, and fed into the later \u2018New Left\u2019 debates of the 1950s. This tradition of left-wing social analysis was intellectually heterogeneous, drawing on a number of literary, sociological, anthropological and ethnographic techniques to argue for the creativity of everyday life. Its key figures were also relatively peripatetic, variously occupying roles as amateur critics, political advisors, professional researchers and tenured academics to push forward their brand of progressive thought. Just as we are familiar with the diverse origins of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century British socialism, this article has shown that a similar variety of ideas and spaces of intellectual production helped to shape subsequent configurations of British left-wing thought.In particular, it has highlighted the existence of a more individualist strand of British left-wing thought, interested in recovering the subjectivity and diversity of everyday life. A number of contemporary Labour Party thinkers have recently revisited the first New Left, arguing that its faith in the instinctive, close-knit nature of working-class culture should be adopted in order to return to more collectivist forms of political and social organisation.[CITATION-146] But, as I have shown, interest in the working class as a group was not the sole element driving left-wing analysis in this period. Just as important was a belief that culture operated at an individual level. Michael Young declared that he wanted to abolish inequality, not because he \u2018wished to make men equal\u2019 but \u2018to show that they were not\u2019.[CITATION-147] Even as the exigencies of post-war political planning caused him to place greater emphasis on the role of group associations, he did not let go of this maxim. These ideas influenced modernisers on both the left and the right of the Labour Party, and also laid the ground for the communitarian politics of \u2018everyday life\u2019 developed by the New Left. Matching an understanding of working-class individuality to an egalitarian collective politics\u2014what Young had described as the greatest \u2018democratic dilemma\u2019\u2014deserves continued appreciation as an enduring theme of mid-twentieth-century left-wing thought.[CITATION-148] The cover inset image from Charles Madge\u2019s(1943).",
