    "article": "The memoirs of the parliamentarian lawyer and MP Bulstrode Whitelocke are invaluable as a primary source for historians wishing to understand the political history of the 1640s and 1650s. Yet, despite broad recognition of the contentious nature of this material, surprisingly little has been done to establish the accuracy of Whitelocke\u2019s account or to probe the motives behind the writing of his post-Restoration reflections. By focusing on Whitelocke\u2019s recollections of two famous encounters with Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and 1652, this article demonstrates that there is much in the detail of those accounts that fails to convince in the light of what is known of events and the author\u2019s activities from evidence beyond his memoirs. Rather, it seems that the accounts of these meetings were fabricated in order to obfuscate Whitelocke\u2019s activities during the Interregnum period and to propagate a series of narratives that served the author\u2019s purposes as he sought political rehabilitation after the Restoration of 1660. By failing to recognise the memory games at play in Whitelocke\u2019s work, historians have unwittingly embedded many of those same narratives in their accounts of the period, not least concerning the durability of the regime established in 1649 and Cromwell\u2019s kingly ambitions.The memoirs of the lawyer and MP Bulstrode Whitelocke (1605\u201375) are as treacherous as they are essential.[CITATION-1] Written after the Restoration, and published posthumously in late 1681 as, Whitelocke\u2019s reflections provide crucial information concerning the Interregnum that is unmentioned in any other source.[CITATION-2] In the evidentially \u2018dark and vacant\u2019 period between the battle of Worcester and the dissolution of the Rump Parliament, Whitelocke offers illumination, not least in his account of two meetings that purportedly took place with Oliver Cromwell in December 1651 and November 1652.[CITATION-3] In recounting those meetings, Whitelocke offers a rare glimpse into Cromwell\u2019s motivations and machinations.Historians have long recognised that Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs must be handled with care. For Thomas Carlyle, Whitelocke\u2019s conversations with Cromwell were of \u2018dubious authenticity\u2019; his memoirs \u2018smack a little of the date when he redacted them\u2019.[CITATION-4] Nevertheless, for want of other evidence, Carlyle and most historians since have relied upon Whitelocke\u2019s account. For all the caveats about memoirs being self-serving and present-centred, Whitelocke\u2019s testimony is taken to be, more or less, truthful.[CITATION-5] His evidence remains integral to scholarly accounts of the 1650s, underpinning historical narratives about the Commonwealth regime and its ultimate failure.This article demonstrates a pressing need to reassess Whitelocke\u2019s evidence and the conclusions built upon it. While Whitelocke did not always remove seemingly damaging material from his accounts, he did shape it to disseminate certain narratives about the various Interregnum regimes and his role within them. Far from shying away from his status as a Cromwellian confidant, he played upon it, using his knowledge of private affairs to obfuscate publicly known details about his activities. Focusing upon Whitelocke\u2019s accounts of his meetings with Cromwell in 1651 and 1652, this article shows how aspects of both accounts fail to match their historical context. Rather, they were perfectly calibrated to suit Whitelocke\u2019s purposes after 1660, obscuring his part in the events of the Interregnum and asserting his enduring loyalty to Stuart monarchy.Besides reassessing Whitelocke\u2019s account, however, this study also illuminates the broader problem of memory sources for civil war scholarship. While important recent research explores how memories of the wars were constructed and contested by examining previously untapped sources, including petitions, ceremony and visual culture, much can still be learned from more familiar repositories of memory, including memoirs.[CITATION-6] Memoirs allow focused study of the dynamic relationship between individual and collective memory\u2014the ways in which private memories were fitted to, or shaped around, \u2018public\u2019 memories prescribed by the state after 1660.[CITATION-7] Yet the relationship was not unidirectional. Whitelocke did not simply frame his memoirs around an accepted public account; he also crafted his own narratives about the events of the 1640s and 50s which, in turn, influenced subsequent civil war histories. This examination of Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs exemplifies the difficult and complex interplay during the early modern period between personal experience, memory and history. Historians must realise that civil war memory is not simply an object of historical study; it is also embedded in civil war histories, underpinning many of the narratives that scholars continue to write about the period.Had Whitelocke never written his memoirs, his role in the events of the 1640s and 1650s would still be recognised today. When awaiting Charles II\u2019s return in early 1660, Whitelocke undoubtedly wished his profile had not been so prominent. One can imagine his reaction in March 1660 when a satirical pamphlet, entitled, cast a spotlight on his political career with particular emphasis on his enmity towards the Stuarts.[CITATION-8] Ventriloquising Whitelocke, the anonymous author claimed that the disrespectful treatment he received while negotiating with Charles I at Oxford in 1643 first \u2018implanted in me such an inveterate, implacable malice to him and his posterity\u2019.[CITATION-9] In 1651, he \u2018was sent to make speeches against the young King\u2019, the future Charles II, \u2018at\u2019, which he did with \u2018much vigour and confidence\u2019.[CITATION-10] Whitelocke\u2019s \u2018Masterpiece\u2019 was his \u2018Embassy unto\u2019, where his aim was \u2018to baffle and depose Princes\u2019, advancing Queen Christina\u2019s abdication in the hope that her successor would be more amenable to invading Poland, thereby drawing off Spanish forces that might otherwise aid the Stuart cause.[CITATION-11] Many wanted revenge on Whitelocke at the Restoration. He noted how he \u2018was threatned by some ag[ains]t whom he had acted ... that they would procure him to be excepted out of the Act of oblivion and generall pardon\u2019.[CITATION-12] The Convention Parliament contained numerous adversaries, chief among whom was the architect of the Restoration, George Monck. Whitelocke heard how Monck worked to have him \u2018excepted in the Act of Oblivion, if not for life\u2019 then \u2018to be disabled for any office &c\u2019.[CITATION-13] Monck\u2019s hostility apparently derived from an incident in November 1659, when, having heard of Monck\u2019s intention to march into England, Whitelocke, then a member of the Committee of Safety, went to the Common Council of London to inform them of \u2018the proceedings of Moncke; & that the bottom of his design was to bring in the King\u2019.[CITATION-14] Monck was incensed by Whitelocke\u2019s actions, which \u2018putt a dishonour uppon him\u2019 and \u2018might [have] spoyled all the buisnes\u2019 of the king\u2019s return.[CITATION-15] For his part, Whitelocke saw no reason why Monck should bear a grudge; of the two of them, \u2018Moncke had the better & the effect of what he designed\u2019.[CITATION-16] Whitelocke did everything he could to avoid the malice of his enemies. He called on friends and family to work on his behalf, even securing an audience with the king in early June 1660.[CITATION-17] The whole effort cost Whitelocke a \u2018great deale of money in gratifications, & buying out of ennemies\u2019.[CITATION-18] Even with such painstaking management, however, Whitelocke could not conceal his past actions. Enemies such as William Prynne, who mined the parliamentary record for evidence against Whitelocke, had plenty to draw upon.[CITATION-19] Pre-empting their accusations, Whitelocke \u2018drew up a large paper of the State of his own case, in all the changes & revolutions\u2019 which he \u2018transcribed & delivered to his friends in both houses as he apprehended fitt & seasonable\u2019.[CITATION-20] This \u2018Case of Bulstrode Whitelocke Kt\u2019 demonstrates the dexterity with which Whitelocke deflected the charges that he anticipated his enemies would level against him. It also provided the basic narrative framework around which he constructed his lengthier memoirs in the years that followed.Whitelocke\u2019s essential defence in 1660 was his avoidance of the key political events of the 1640s and 1650s. He \u2018had no hand in secluding the members of the House of Commons, nor in any force uppon publicke assemblies att any [time] butt declared his judgem[en]t ag[ains]t it & refused to act in it, & detested it\u2019.[CITATION-21] Of course, he passed silently over his willingness to servethose regimes responsible for forcing parliaments. He also disavowed any role in Charles I\u2019s trial. He could hardly deny that he had been named to the committee appointed on 23 December 1648 to \u2018consider how to proceed in a way of Justice against the King\u2019: it was in the Commons\u2019 Journal.[CITATION-22] But Whitelocke insisted that he refused to attend the committee; he left town and \u2018returned not, till that buisnes was over\u2019.[CITATION-23] Whitelocke also denied involvement in the various constitutional upheavals of the Interregnum. He had \u2018no hand in any changes of governem[en]t, the greatest whereof were made when he was beyond Sea\u2019.[CITATION-24] This defence is intriguing when one considers that Whitelocke was only \u2018beyond Sea\u2019, serving as extraordinary ambassador to Sweden, from November 1653 to the summer of 1654. This meant he was absent during the establishment of the Protectorate; but he was very much at the centre of affairs for other significant upheavals, including the abolition of the kingly office and the House of Lords in early 1649, and the forced dissolutions of the Rump in 1653 and 1659. To diminish his own culpability, Whitelocke stressed that the Cromwellian seizure of power in late 1653, rather than the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1649, was the revolutionary pivot of the period.Equally devious was Whitelocke\u2019s assertion that Cromwell never really trusted him. \u2018Cromwell bare him no favour, but left him out of the Little Parlem[en]t, & out of his Councell, before & after he was Prot[ecto]r\u2019.[CITATION-25] According to Whitelocke, Cromwell even coerced him into going to Sweden \u2018to ridde him out of the way\u2019.[CITATION-26] He played down the fact that he retained Cromwell\u2019s favour during the Protectorate, though he could not altogether conceal it. Even after he \u2018layd downe\u2019 his place as lord commissioner of the Great Seal in 1655 in opposition to Chancery reforms, he accepted a lucrative treasury post.[CITATION-27] Whitelocke was apparently still in favour in June 1657 when, at Cromwell\u2019s second inauguration ceremony, he rode in the protectoral coach and even helped to vest the Protector with his robes of state. Further advancement followed later that year when Whitelocke was summoned by Cromwell to sit as a lord in the newly created \u2018Other House\u2019.[CITATION-28] Whitelocke also sought to underline his enduring loyalty to the Stuart cause. He countered accusations that his Swedish embassy was prejudicial to the royalists. He stressed that his mission \u2018did not derogate from the K[ing]\u2019; Queen Christina herself remarked how he \u2018spake of his Prince w[i]th respect, & of his adversaries like a gentleman\u2019.[CITATION-29] Mischievously, Whitelocke also called on Cromwell as a witness to his pro-Stuart credentials. Cromwell did not trust Whitelocke, and kept him out of favour, precisely because he \u2018him to incline to the Kings restauration, & to have correspondence for that end, as their Intelligences also informed the Councell\u2019.[CITATION-30] The phrasing here is a masterpiece of studied ambiguity. Whitelocke did not claim that he advocated Charles II\u2019s restoration, only that Cromwellthat he did. The Council received \u2018Intelligences\u2019 claiming that Whitelocke had correspondence \u2018for that end\u2019\u2014but were these reports?[CITATION-31] In the light of what he later wrote in his memoirs, it is intriguing that Whitelocke did not claim in his \u2018Case\u2019 that he told Cromwell directly of his preference for restoring Charles II.Ultimately, Whitelocke\u2019s efforts paid off. On 14 June 1660, after reading the \u2018humble Petition of Bulstrode Whitlock\u2019, the motion to except him from the Act of General Pardon, Indemnity and Oblivion was defeated by 175 votes to 134, or \u2018carryed by 50 voices\u2019, in Whitelocke\u2019s exaggerated account.[CITATION-32] It was in this tense atmosphere, as Whitelocke struggled to defend life, property and career, that he devised a number of narratives about the 1640s and 50s which were subsequently fleshed out in his memoirs. Whitelocke worked on those memoirs around the mid-1660s, producing two manuscripts that, after heavy editing, were published posthumously as the.[CITATION-33] The first and more detailed of the manuscripts, known as the \u2018Annales\u2019, begins in the year of Whitelocke\u2019s birth, 1605, and ends in 1656; the second, described erroneously by its modern editor as Whitelocke\u2019s \u2018Diary\u2019, begins in the same year but continues up to his death in 1675.[CITATION-34] The relationship between the manuscripts is ambiguous. The \u2018Annales\u2019 is described as a \u2018public history\u2019\u2014telling the story of English affairs, but written in the first person. The \u2018Diary\u2019, though covering many of the same events, lacks the detail of the \u2018Annales\u2019 and describes Whitelocke\u2019s activities in the third person. The anonymous editor of the printedseems to have consulted both manuscripts\u2014up until 1656, the bulk of the text derives from the \u2018Annales\u2019, albeit rendering the text in the third person; after 1656, the editor appears to have continued the narrative by using the \u2018Diary\u2019.[CITATION-35] This means that theare a hotchpotch that reproduces neither of Whitelocke\u2019s original texts faithfully. An updated edition of the, printed in 1732 and reissued in 1853, converts the text back to the first person, and adds previously unprinted material from the \u2018Annales\u2019, but much remains omitted or imperfect. For this reason, we must turn to the manuscripts to explore more closely the narrative that Whitelocke, as opposed to his editors, wanted to tell.It is unclear why Whitelocke wrote his memoirs, or why he composed two separate accounts.[CITATION-36] In the \u2018Annales\u2019, he insists that they were merely \u2018to instruct his children\u2019 and were not \u2018for publique view\u2019. Yet he also warned his children that they would probably \u2018heare your father censured\u2019 for the work.[CITATION-37] Indeed, it is possible that, like the \u2018Case of Bulstrode Whitelocke\u2019 in 1660, his memoirs circulated in manuscript. The vigour with which Whitelocke battled against being barred permanently from office in 1660 suggests that he hoped for political rehabilitation. Yet, even with the full benefit of the Act of General Pardon, Whitelocke struggled to decontaminate his past. The fact that he found so much time to write these accounts, along with a couple of toadying treatises for Charles II in defence of monarchical power, attests to his ongoing efforts to escape the political wilderness.[CITATION-38] Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs are an exercise in legerdemain; they draw attention to certain events while distracting the reader from others. They must be scrutinised closely to comprehend why exactly Whitelocke chose to divulge certain information and, where possible, to look for what was hidden or omitted. Besides exploring how each episode fits within the story that Whitelocke wanted to tell, we must examine whether his account stands up to what we know outside of his text; where events have no proof beyond Whitelocke we must be especially wary.One such event is the meeting that Whitelocke records under the date of 10 December 1651 as \u2018Uppon the defeat att Worcester\u2019.[CITATION-39] According to Whitelocke, Cromwell \u2018desired a meeting with divers Members of Parliament, and some chief Officers of the Army, at the Speakers House\u2019. There, Cromwell:proposed to them, that now the old king being dead, & his son being defeated, he held it necessary, to come to a settlem[en]t of the Nation. And in order therunto he had requested this meeting, that we togither might consider & advise what was fitt to be done, & to be presented to the Parlem[en]t.Whitelocke opened the discussion by asking \u2018in the first place\u2019 what sort of government was desired: \u2018whether of an absolute Republique, or with any mixture of Monarchy\u2019. Cromwell agreed this was \u2018the right point, & indeed it is my meaning, that we should consider, whether a republique, or a mixt Monarchicall governem[en]t will be best to be setled, & if any thing Monarchicall, then in whome that power shall be placed\u2019.[CITATION-40] Whitelocke claims that the army officers present \u2018were ag[ains]t any thing of Monarchy\u2019; the lawyers, on the other hand, \u2018were generally for a mixt Monarchicall governem[en]t, & many were for the D[uke] of Gloucester\u2019, Charles I\u2019s youngest son, \u2018to be made king\u2019. Whitelocke himself proposed that there \u2018may be a day given for the kings eldest son, or for the D[uke] of Yorke his brother to come in to the Parlem[en]t, & uppon such termes as shall be thought fitt, & agreeable both to our Civill and spirituall liberties, a settlem[en]t may be made with him\u2019. Cromwell, responding to the lawyers\u2019 suggestions, opined that it would \u2018be a buisnes of more than ordinary difficulty\u2019, but \u2018if it may be done with safety, & preservation of our rights both as English men, & as Christians, that a settlem[en]t with somewhat of Monarchicall power in it, would be very effectuall\u2019.[CITATION-41] For historians, this meeting demarcates a crucial phase in the history of the Commonwealth regime.[CITATION-42] The post-Worcester turning point is a central motif of Blair Worden\u2019s seminal study of the Rump Parliament. Besides galvanising radical aspirations in the army for social, legal and religious reform, it was an occasion for constitutional reflection. The abolition of monarchy was deeply unpopular even among those complicit in the events of 1649; kingless government was a stop-gap and never meant to be a permanent fixture.[CITATION-43] Those wanting to restore monarchy had to be patient, however. \u2018Before Worcester\u2019, Worden explains, \u2018the royalist threat made it unthinkable that the Rump should voluntarily restore monarchy\u2019.[CITATION-44] It was \u2018only when the royalist threat had been eliminated\u2019 that it became \u2018practical to advance proposals for some form of monarchical settlement\u2019, and \u2018Cromwell was among the first to air them\u2019.[CITATION-45] In the short term, however, nothing came of those discussions, \u2018and the issue of monarchy was quietly dropped\u2019.[CITATION-46] But was \u2018the issue of monarchy\u2019 ever an issue at all? Beyond Whitelocke\u2019s account, and a few hostile pamphlets making the perennial accusation that Cromwell sought to be king, there is little to suggest that Cromwell\u2019s preference was for kingly government or that MPs were working towards such a settlement.[CITATION-47] The reliance on Whitelocke\u2019s unique testimony becomes especially concerning when one considers several anomalies in the content of his account. Most curious is the assumption underlying the conference: that its participants had a free choice between a republican and a monarchical settlement. While historians habitually point to this meeting to demonstrate the appetite for constitutional change post-Worcester, a closer look at Whitelocke\u2019s account suggests that the discussion concerned not so much aof government as theof one.All the speakers seemed oblivious to the realities of the political settlement as it stood in 1651: it was as if the events of 1649 had never happened. For instance, when John Desborough asked, \u2018why may not this as well as other Nations, be governed in the way of a Republique?\u2019, he ignored that this was precisely the way the nation had been governed since 1649.[CITATION-48] He did not ask why the nation should notto be governed in such a way. Conversely, the lawyers argued that a settlement without monarchy would be unworkable. Oliver St John believed that it \u2018be found, that the governem[en]t of this Nation, without something of Monarchicall power,be very difficult to be so setled, as not to shake the foundation of our lawes, & the liberties of the people\u2019; Whitelocke was adamant that the \u2018lawes of England are so interwoven, with the power & practise of Monarchy, that to settle a governem[en]t without somthing of Monarchy in it,make so great an alteration in the proceedings of our lawe,, nor can we wellthe inconveniencies which will arise therby\u2019.[CITATION-49] Both St John and Whitelocke warned of problems thatarisethe government were settled in a non-monarchical fashion. They ignored completely the fact that the government had already been settled \u2018without somthing of Monarchy\u2019 for almost three years; one wonders why itsshould make \u2018so great an alteration\u2019 that they had \u2018scarce time to rectify\u2019 its faults or to anticipate its inconveniences. They ignored the changes effected in early 1649 to facilitate the exercise of the laws under the new kingless regime, not least the alteration of writs and styles used in the law courts, which Whitelocke helped to draft.[CITATION-50] Moreover, all of those lawyers present had acted in their judicial capacities since the establishment of the Commonwealth. Yet none of the opponents of monarchy raised this fundamental flaw in the lawyers\u2019 argument: that by serving the post-1649 kingless regime they were witnesses against themselves.Equally strange is that nobody at the meeting mentioned the 1649 Act abolishing the kingly office, which stated bluntly that \u2018no one person whatsoever shall or may have, or hold the office, style, dignity, power or authority of King\u2019.[CITATION-51] While it could be contended that the \u2018mixed monarchical\u2019 solution proposed at the meeting circumvented the Act by proposing that kingly power be shared, and not reside in one person alone, the fact remains that all the suggested candidates were prohibited by that law. Those who endeavoured \u2018the reviving or setting up again of any pretended right\u2019 of Charles, James or \u2018any other the issue and posterity of the said late King ... to the said regal office, style, dignity, or authority\u2019 were to be proceeded against as traitors.[CITATION-52] It therefore seems odd that Sir Thomas Widdrington blithely supposed that \u2018we shall hold it most just to place that power in one of the sons of the late king\u2019.[CITATION-53] Whitelocke even proposed that a day be appointed for Charles or James \u2018to come in to the Parlem[en]t\u2019 so that \u2018a settlem[en]t may be made with him\u2019.[CITATION-54] Edward Whalley objected by pointing out that \u2018[t]he kings eldest son hath bin in armes ag[ains]t us, & his 2[nd] son likewise is our ennemy\u2019, but failed to note the Act barring them from the throne. Widdrington recommended \u2018the late kings third son, the D[uke] of Gloucester\u2019, who was \u2018still amongst us, & too young to have bin in armes ag[ains]t us, or infected with the principles of our ennemies\u2019.[CITATION-55] Yet this still amounted to setting upthe issue and posterity\u2019 of Charles I and was no less treasonous under the purview of the Act.Intriguingly, when referring to the meeting, few historians give credence to the names that Whitelocke claims were touted as potential kings. For instance, Austin Woolrych and J.C. Davis both ignore Whitelocke\u2019s suggestion about inviting Charles or James to take the Crown, noting only the plan to crown Gloucester.[CITATION-56] Ian Gentles does not mention the Stuart candidates at all, suggesting that once Cromwell expressed a preference for settlement with \u2018somewhat of monarchical power\u2019 in it, \u2018the thought would have occurred to everyone in the room that since no Stuart was permitted to exercise monarchical power, who else but Oliver could fill the role?\u2019 Yet Whitelocke\u2019s account hardly bears this out. Those lawyers who backed the Stuart children seem to have been oblivious to what Gentles suggests should have been obvious: that \u2018no Stuart was permitted to exercise monarchical power\u2019.[CITATION-57] Leaving aside the 1649 Act, the proposals for a Stuart restoration also seem odd, given the timing of the meeting. When introducing his account, Whitelocke makes plain that the conference took place \u2018Uppon theatt Worcester\u2019\u2014a strange choice of words for what was, emphatically, a parliamentarian victory.[CITATION-58] From the outset, Whitelocke emphasises that this battle was a decisive blow to the royalist cause. This is backed up by Cromwell\u2019s opening address: \u2018that now the old king being dead, & his son being defeated, he held it necessary to come to a settlem[en]t of the Nation\u2019.[CITATION-59] It suggests that Cromwell could only contemplate settlement once the Stuarts were totally defeated and their hopes of recovery extinguished. In short, when introducing this meeting, Whitelocke signposts repeatedly that onlythe king was dead, andhis son was completely defeated, were minds able to turn to constitutional settlement.With this context established, the words uttered by Whitelocke at the 1651 meeting assume a greater magnanimity than if they had been expressed in an earlier or later setting. His willingness to offer Charles the opportunity to return when his cause was at its lowest ebb amplified Whitelocke\u2019s good intentions. He made no secret that there should be conditions: any settlement with Charles should be \u2018uppon such termes as shall be thought fitt\u2019 to secure \u2018our Civill & spirituall liberties\u2019.[CITATION-60] Of course, this was exactly what occurred in 1660. Yet Whitelocke\u2019s suggestion, in the context of late 1651, is far more generous given that, at that point, the incumbent government was secure\u2014poles apart from the pandemonium of 1659 that narrowed political options drastically. Monck brought about a restoration in 1660 because there was no viable alternative; Whitelocke claimed to have advocated that strategy in 1651 when the possibilities for future settlement seemed open.But this is all an illusion. If we look at Whitelocke\u2019s actions outside the framing of his own account, his attitude towards the Stuarts appears far less benign around the time of Worcester. On 25 August 1651, the Commons\u2019 Journal records that Whitelocke reported \u2018from the Council of State, a Proclamation, declaring Charles Stewart, and his Abbettors, Agents, and Complices, to be Rebels and Traitors to the Commonwealth of England\u2019.[CITATION-61] That he neglects to mention this in his memoirs is understandable. The proclamation did not mince its words: Charles was already \u2018a Traytor of a former Date\u2019 and had since rendered himself \u2018more and more obnoxious to the Penalties of the Laws of England, Declaring and Adjudging High Treason\u2019.[CITATION-62] When the proclamation was published the following day, the Rump also ordered that a letter sent by Charles to the Lord Mayor and aldermen of London, forwarded to Parliament by Whitelocke on the Council\u2019s behalf, should be \u2018burnt ... by the Hand of the common Hangman\u2019.[CITATION-63] Whitelocke\u2019s role in blackening Charles\u2019s reputation lived on in royalist memories. The hostilerecalled the time when Whitelocke was \u2018sent to make speeches against the young King atwhen he was at\u2019, which he did \u2018with so much vigour and confidence\u2019 that Robert Tichborne, alderman and sheriff of London, \u2018durst throw the Kings Declaration into the fire made at the Exchange\u2019.[CITATION-64] It surely served Whitelocke\u2019s purposes to distract from this episode by claiming that, shortly after, he recommended Charles\u2019s rehabilitation. Yet it seems unlikely. Even after their emphatic victory at Worcester, the majority in Parliament sought to bring Charles to justice, not to negotiate with him. One week after the battle, Parliament issued a further proclamation calling for the \u2018Discovery and Apprehending of, and other Traytors his Adherents and Abettors\u2019. In no uncertain terms, it demanded the \u2018speedy Apprehending of such a Malicious and Dangerous Traytor to the Peace of this Commonwealth\u2019; he was \u2018to be proceeded with ... as Justice shall require\u2019.[CITATION-65] Even if Whitelocke was prepared to ignore Charles\u2019s crimes, it is unlikely that the army officers at the meeting in December would have forgotten them. Yet, as with the deafening silence concerning the 1649 Act, according to Whitelocke nobody mentioned that Charles had been declared a traitor by Parliament.Equally suspicious is the lack of a British context in Whitelocke\u2019s account. Arguably, the settlement of Scotland, not England, was Parliament\u2019s priority immediately after Worcester. Plans for union were announced in a declaration by the Council that was presented by Whitelocke for the Rump\u2019s approval on 23 October.[CITATION-66] According to that declaration, Scotland was to be:incorporated into, and become One Commonwealth with this of England; whereby thethat is established here, and enjoyed by the good People of this Nation, under theof England, asmay be derived and communicated unto them, with such convenient speed, as the same can be made practicable amongst them.[CITATION-67] There was no suggestion that Scotland, or England, would return to monarchy: the declaration castigated \u2018Charls Stuart, pretended King of the Scots\u2019 and his abettors.[CITATION-68] That Whitelocke said nothing in his memoirs about his involvement in this declaration is hardly surprising. By setting out its blueprint for Scotland, Parliament reaffirmed its confidence in the constitutional arrangement already settled in England. This was not a regime riddled by self-doubt or pausing to reflect upon the basis and form of its government: rather, that form of government was to be exported to Scotland in order to extirpate the dregs of Stuart monarchy.[CITATION-69] Besides presenting the draft declaration to the Rump, Whitelocke also reported the Council\u2019s recommendations for eight commissioners to be sent into Scotland, including Oliver St John.[CITATION-70] The commissioners\u2019 instructions were debated by the Rump on 4 December.[CITATION-71] On 10 December, the day when Whitelocke suggests the meeting at the Speaker\u2019s house took place, he reported amendments to those instructions.[CITATION-72] If there really was a meeting that day, surely Scotland would have been at the forefront of the minds of those present\u2014particularly St John, who was preparing for his journey north. And yet, according to Whitelocke\u2019s account, nobody mentioned Scotland at all. While discussing the future of the English government, nobody thought it worthy of note that the Rump had already decided to extend kingless government into Scotland. According to Whitelocke, discussion focused on the settlement of \u2018the Nation\u2019; nothing was said about the nations.Much of Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 meeting seems odd upon closer inspection. The content of the meeting sits uneasily with the context in which it purportedly took place and contains startling silences, not least concerning the 1649 Act, the proclamations against Charles II and the issue of settling Scotland. Such are the incongruities in the account that one might ask whether the meeting occurred at all.Yet the 1651 meeting was not the only occasion in Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs when he was embroiled in discussions concerning the nation\u2019s future settlement. Three years earlier, in December 1648, Whitelocke had similar conversations with many of those who were present in 1651. On 18 December 1648, Whitelocke notes how he and Widdrington went to the office of the Master of the Rolls and Speaker of the Commons, William Lenthall, to meet with Cromwell. The assembled had \u2018a long discourse togither about the present affayres\u2019, concluding with Cromwell appointing \u2018another time ... for us to meet againe ... to consider & conferre how the settlem[en]t of the kingdome might be best effected\u2019.[CITATION-73] The next meeting took place on 21 December at the Speaker\u2019s house, where discussion again turned to \u2018the settlem[en]t of the kingdom\u2019. In conclusion, Widdrington and Whitelocke were enjoined to \u2018drawe up tomorrowe, some heads uppon the discourse\u2019.[CITATION-74] The paper they produced included \u2018heads for a Declaration, what the Parlem[en]t intendeth for the settlem[en]t of the kingdome, to be considered off, & offered to the Parlem[en]t & Council of the Army\u2019.[CITATION-75] This all seems very familiar. In his account of the 1651 meeting, Whitelocke claims that Cromwell \u2018held it necessary, to come to a settlem[en]t of the Nation\u2019 and hoped those present \u2018might consider & advise what was fitt to be done, & to be presented to the Parlem[en]t\u2019.[CITATION-76] The feeling ofis more pronounced when one reads Whitelocke\u2019s account of a subsequent meeting on the afternoon of 23 December 1648. Once again, he and Widdrington went by \u2018appointm[en]t\u2019 to the \u2018speakers house\u2019 and met \u2018divers gentlemen of the house, & we consulted about setling the kingdome by the Parlem[en]t, & not to leave all to the sword\u2019. Although theare not divulged, Whitelocke hints that discussion centred upon the issue of what to dothe king\u2019s trial. Should the army be left to shift for itself or should a parliamentary settlement be put in place? Both Whitelocke and Widdrington \u2018spake our minds freely\u2019\u2014although he never reveals what they said. Instead, Whitelocke provides a synopsis of the meeting, the details of which are familiar enough:some of them were wholly ag[ains]t having any king att all, others were ag[ains]t having the present king or his eldest or second son, to be king, others were for the 3[rd] son the D[uke] of Gloucester, who was among them, & might be educated as they should appoint, to be made king.[CITATION-77] Interestingly, it seems nobody spoke for the current king. The key issue was whether to have no \u2018king att all\u2019 or to retain monarchy with one of Charles I\u2019s offspring.Although held three years apart, the meetings of 1648 and 1651 took place at the same location, involved many of the same people, and offered the same solutions. But were they really separate meetings? Perhaps Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 conference simply transposes details from 1648 to three years later. The inconsistencies in the content of the 1651 meeting disappear when applied to the context of late 1648. With preparations for the king\u2019s trial underway, it was perfectly natural to consider the question of settlement. It made sense for Whitelocke to ask whether \u2018an absolute Republique\u2019 or government with \u2018any mixture of Monarchy\u2019 was the best way forward, because that decision had yet to be made. In this context, St John\u2019s warning that it \u2018will be found, that the governem[en]t of this Nation, without something of Monarchicall power, will be very difficult to be settled\u2019, or Whitelocke\u2019s complaints that kingless government would make such changes in legal proceedings \u2018that you have scarce time to rectify, nor can we well foresee the inconveniencies\u2019, seem apposite.[CITATION-78] In late 1648, the lawyers stared into the abyss, pondering the consequences of the king\u2019s destruction. With the purged Parliament and army officers pushing forward the king\u2019s trial and execution there was a pressing need to find a settlement sooner rather than later.Whitelocke\u2019s proposal that a day might be \u2018given for the kings eldest son, or for the D[uke] of Yorke his brother to come in to the Parlem[en]t\u2019 also seems more appropriate in the context of late 1648.[CITATION-79] At that point Charles and James had not so blotted their copybooks as to preclude the possibility of them ascending to their father\u2019s throne. The army\u2019sof November 1648 proposed \u2018that a timely and peremptory day may be set for the Prince ofand the Duke ofto come in and render themselves\u2019.[CITATION-80] Of course, even if the Stuart brothers complied, thedid not guarantee rehabilitation. It recommended that Charles \u2018be proceeded against in justice, or remitted, according as upon his appearance he shall give satisfaction or not\u2019. Likewise, James must \u2018give satisfaction or not concerning his carriage in and since his going out of the kingdome (being without leave) and in opposition or Contempt of the Parliament\u2019 before he could \u2018be considered as to future trust, or not\u2019.[CITATION-81] Yet thedemonstrates that in late 1648, even in army circles, the possibility of Charles or James becoming king remained open. The same could not be said in 1651: besides the Act of 1649, the Rump\u2019s emphatic declarations of treason against Charles and his abettors for their complicity in levying a third Civil War meant that, if they were to fall into Parliament\u2019s hands, judicial proceedings were assured and not merely a possibility.The plan to make Henry Stuart, duke of Gloucester, king also better fits the context of late 1648. On 23 December 1648, it was urged that Gloucester, \u2018who was among them, & might be educated as they should appoint \u2026 be made king\u2019.[CITATION-82] Similarly, at the 1651 meeting Widdrington touted Gloucester, who was \u2018still amongst us & too young to have bin in armes ag[ains]t us, or infected with the principles of our ennemies\u2019.[CITATION-83] Yet, while Gloucester was very much \u2018among them\u2019 in late 1648, residing in London in the care of the earl of Northumberland, this was not the case by late 1651. In mid-1650, following Charles\u2019s arrival in Scotland, the Council of State deemed it unsafe to keep the younger Stuart children nearby. In response, the Rump resolved that Henry \u2018be removed forthwith beyond the Seas,\u2019.[CITATION-84] Ultimately, the Council sent Henry and his sister Elizabeth to the Isle of Wight, under the guardianship of Anthony Mildmay.[CITATION-85] It may also be significant that Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 meeting is far more detailed than those of late 1648. While this could reflect his fading memory of events, it may have been a deliberate ploy. In the context of the Restoration, it would be understandable if Whitelocke played down his role in discussions about constitutional settlement without Charles I that took placethe king\u2019s trial and execution. Whitelocke was careful enough to note that the 23 December meeting occurred only after Charles\u2019s position seemed hopeless. He describes in the \u2018Annales\u2019 how, earlier that day, there had been \u2018a sharpe debate\u2019 in the Commons which \u2018sett on foote\u2019 the \u2018great designe of taking away the King\u2019: the \u2018fierce party\u2019, backed by the army, \u2018prosecuted their designe with all eagerness\u2019, meaning that \u2018no opposition would be to any effect or purpose\u2019.[CITATION-86] This provides the necessary context for the meeting at the Speaker\u2019s house that afternoon; that is, it was onlythe fate of the king was certain that discussion of a settlement without Charles began in earnest, with many MPs attempting to preserve Stuart monarchy. But this was an inglorious defence: it made the best of a bad job, effectively conceding Charles I\u2019s ruin. The sensitivity of the discussions at that meeting may explain why, when writing up his \u2018Diary\u2019, Whitelocke omitted it altogether.[CITATION-87] It served Whitelocke\u2019s cause to shift details from the 1648 meetings to the context of 1651. In this later setting, speeches in favour of the Stuart children became a plea for restoration, rather than a tacit condoning of the removal of Charles I. It gave the impression that Whitelocke and many MPsto harbour hopes in 1651 of seeing one of Charles\u2019s sons placed on the throne. Above all, the 1651 meeting distracts from Whitelocke\u2019s prominent role in bringing the regime of 1649 into being. Besides entrusting Whitelocke to prepare an order for altering the style of writs so that legal proceedings ran in the name of Parliament rather than the king, the Rump also committed the drafting of the Act for abolishing the House of Lords to his \u2018especial care\u2019.[CITATION-88] Moreover, Whitelocke helped to pen the Rump\u2019sof 17 March 1649, which defended \u2018Setling the present Government In the way of A Free State\u2019.[CITATION-89] This was, quite literally, a defining document for the fledgling regime; it defended the regicide as well as the abolition of the kingly office. Whitelocke\u2019s prominent role in drafting the Declaration stuck in the memories of his enemies: hostile commentators writing across the following decade remembered \u2018Declaration\u2019 or \u2018Patriot... his Declaration for a Free State\u2019.[CITATION-90] Whitelocke could hardly deny his authorship of the. He admitted in his memoirs that on 16 March he presented Parliament with \u2018a draught of the Declaration which he was commanded to drawe\u2019.[CITATION-91] Yet he alleged that the draft he presented was very different to the published version. After his draft was read in Parliament, it was \u2018moved to passe it presently without any committm[en]t\u2019 but Whitelocke \u2018moved it might be committed to amend some faults in it\u2019. This proved to be counter-productive, because \u2018uppon the Commitem[en]t they made it much sharper than I had drawne it, & added divers clauses, which I thought matters fitt to have been omitted\u2019.[CITATION-92] This was an ingenious defence. Unable to deny his role in drafting the, Whitelocke claimed to have penned a milder version, only for it to be amended, expanded and made \u2018much sharper\u2019. But aspects of Whitelocke\u2019s account are suspect. One wonders why the radical majority in Parliament initially accepted Whitelocke\u2019s draft \u2018without any committm[en]t\u2019; it was apparently only after Whitelocke himself requested a committal that sweeping changes were made. Moreover, the fact that the Journal records that Whitelocke reported those revisions on 17 March casts doubt on the extent to which he disapproved of them.[CITATION-93] Whitelocke fails to elaborate on the \u2018faults\u2019 in his original draft and those matters in the revised version that he thought better \u2018omitted\u2019. His defence is another example of his clever use of silence and concision to allow the best possible reading of his actions. Despite conceding authorship of thehe leaves it to the reader\u2019s imagination to guess what portions were his and which were \u2018sharper\u2019 than he intended.After the Restoration, there were clearly some passages in thefrom which Whitelocke was more eager to distance himself than others. Particularly troubling would have been the opening section justifying both the king\u2019s execution and the exclusion of the House of Stuart. It stressed that Charles\u2019s crimes tainted his children, making them incapable of rule. It was clear that \u2018from these Branches could be expected no other, then the same bitter Fruit which fell in the Reign of the Father, who had engaged Them in his own ways and quarrel\u2019. Because the \u2018two Eldest\u2019 sons had appeared \u2018in actual Arms\u2019 against Parliament, it was clear that \u2018No more Safety or Security could be hoped for from Them, then from their Predecessor\u2019. Moreover, thedenied that \u2018the younger Children\u2019, including the duke of Gloucester, \u2018were born to any thing\u2019. To avoid a \u2018Succession of Misery\u2019 it was decided to take \u2018away the Succession of that, from whence it hath always risen, and would certainly spring again, if permitted to take new Root\u2019.[CITATION-94] There was nothing to suggest any glimmer of hope for a Stuart restoration: it was a firm defence of that clause in the Act abolishing the kingly office which made it treason to set up \u2018any pretended Right of ... the Issue and Posterity of the ... late King\u2019.[CITATION-95] For a man who claimed \u2018no hand\u2019 in the greatest upheavals of the Interregnum, Whitelocke clearly helped to facilitate the change of government in 1649, including the altered form of legal writs, the Act abolishing the House of Lords and the printed defence of the new regime. When writing his memoirs, Whitelocke never denied his role in establishing the Commonwealth regime: his profile had been too prominent for such a tactic to work. Instead, he minimised his complicity and diminished the threat that regime posed to the Stuart cause. His account of the 1651 meeting is integral to this process. It suggests that, whatever his involvement, the constitutional changes of 1649 were a stop-gap, not a bar to monarchy or the Stuart cause. It gives the impression that the discussions of late 1648 did not end when Whitelocke and others backed the kingless Commonwealth in 1649. Rather, they continued to long for a monarchical government, and a Stuart revival, well into the 1650s.These narrative strategies, when coupled with the many inconsistences between content and context, all strengthen the case for Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 meeting being either a complete invention or based upon words uttered in late 1648. Of course, the latter option raises further issues that would need explanation. Most obviously, while most of the speakers mentioned were in London in both late 1648 and 1651, a few were not. Charles Fleetwood does not appear to have been active in army affairs in late 1648 and John Desborough was not in London, being appointed governor of Yarmouth. Equally, some key players in the discussions in late 1648 are missing from the conversation in 1651. For instance, Richard Deane, one of the officers at meetings in late 1648, was away from London in 1651 serving as a major general in the army then occupying Scotland.[CITATION-96] Cromwell\u2019s son-in-law Henry Ireton was also a key figure in late 1648, but in 1651 he was commanding Parliament\u2019s forces in Ireland, where he died on 26 November.[CITATION-97] All this does not eliminate the possibility that Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 meeting borrows details of conversations from three years earlier, however. Perhaps earlier speeches from 1648 were assigned to speakers known to have been around in late 1651. This could explain a curious mistake whereby Fleetwood and Desborough are both assigned the rank of \u2018Colonel\u2019. By late 1651 these men were Lieutenant General and Major General respectively, and in earlier and subsequent passages of the \u2018Annales\u2019 Whitelocke gives both their correct titles.[CITATION-98] Perhaps the slip reveals that their names were added as an afterthought. With officers such as Deane or Ireton no longer around in late 1651, Whitelocke may have assigned their roles in the discussions of 1648 to figures who became prominent players in the regimes of the 1650s.More broadly, whether Whitelocke invented or recycled his account of the 1651 meeting, it might also be asked how he expected to get away with it. If, contrary to his professions about seeking only to instruct his children, his manuscripts were circulated more widely, we might think that Whitelocke risked his deception being exposed by the meetings\u2019 participants. Yet this was unlikely: of the eight men whom Whitelocke records speaking besides himself, four were dead and three were in exile by the time he worked on his \u2018Annales\u2019.[CITATION-99] Charles Fleetwood was the only participant still living in England, but he remained tainted by his prominent role in the events of 1659; he was barred from holding office under the Act of General Pardon in 1660 and lived out his days in obscurity.[CITATION-100] Crucially, none of those lawyers who allegedly joined Whitelocke in recommending Stuart monarchy in 1651 were around to verify, or contradict, his story.So far this article has suggested that Whitelocke\u2019s account of the post-Worcester conference in 1651 is a fabrication, possibly grounded upon discussions that occurred three years earlier. Such an invention served Whitelocke\u2019s purposes in two ways: it indicated that the regime established in 1649 was never intended to last and implied that those involved in that regime, Whitelocke included, did not envisage or want the extirpation of Stuart monarchy. The fact that Whitelocke helped to establish the kingless regime and promoted anti-Stuart polemic is obscured by a narrative that suggests enduring loyalty to both monarchy and the Stuart cause. Yet Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1651 meeting also brought out another key theme that runs throughout his memoirs, namely the story of Cromwell\u2019s scheming for the Crown. This trope served two important purposes: besides showing that Whitelocke was Cromwell\u2019s dupe, it demonstrated that even Cromwell believed monarchy was preferable to kingless forms of government.Beyond Whitelocke\u2019s account, however, there is little to suggest that Cromwell favoured a government with \u2018somewhat of Monarchicall power in it\u2019. As with other aspects of the 1651 meeting, these words seem more suited to the context of late 1648. Then, in line with the army\u2019s, Cromwell was probably amenable to the option of a settlement with a semblance of monarchical power in it, most likely with Gloucester as a puppet king.[CITATION-101] Yet, once the decision was taken to abolish kingship, nothing outside of Whitelocke\u2019s testimony suggests that Cromwell professed a desire for the return of monarchical rule.[CITATION-102] With Charles II defeated, it does not appear that Cromwell suddenly had an appetite for constitutional change. Writing immediately after the battle of Worcester to Speaker Lenthall, Cromwell claimed that it had pleased God \u2018to establish the nation and the change of government, by making the people so willing to the defence thereof\u2019. Far from being an opportunity for constitutional change, Cromwell saw the decisive crushing of the Stuart cause as a providential affirmation of the kingless regime. What was now needed, according to Cromwell, was\u2014 social, legal and religious\u2014not aof government.[CITATION-103] According to Whitelocke\u2019s testimony, however, Cromwell not only contemplated replacing the kingless regime after Worcester, but also pondered setting himself up as monarch. The best-known, and most often cited, evidence of Cromwell\u2019s machinations is Whitelocke\u2019s record of a private conversation that he claimed to have had with Cromwell in St James\u2019s Park in November 1652.[CITATION-104] Like the 1651 meeting, however, many aspects of this account are problematic. Most obviously, there are technical grounds for questioning Whitelocke\u2019s report. Even if the conversation happened, it is unlikely that he made an accurate record of it. The version in the \u2018Annales\u2019 is set in the form of a detailed dialogue between the two men, giving an impression of immediacy and completeness. Yet unless Whitelocke took notes as he strolled with Cromwell in the park, his account would have been subject to memory fade, exacerbated by however much time elapsed before he committed it to paper. As Worden notes, Whitelocke\u2019s use of dialogue as a literary device casts doubt upon the accuracy of his record. It is for this reason that Worden sees the record of this conversation in the \u2018Diary\u2019, which is not in dialogue form and is much more concise, as the \u2018more lifelike\u2019 or \u2018fresher\u2019 of the two accounts.[CITATION-105] Leaving aside the practicalities of recording early modern utterances, however, there is much about the content of the conversation, as with the 1651 meeting, that does not match the context in which it supposedly took place or what we know of the subsequent actions of Whitelocke and Cromwell. The dialogue recorded in the \u2018Annales\u2019 opens with Cromwell complaining about the Rump\u2019s inaction on the issue of reform. This aspect of the conversation is believable enough, given Cromwell\u2019s writings and actions elsewhere. In words that echo his letters after Dunbar and Worcester, Cromwell claimed the need to \u2018improve the mercies & successes which God hath given us, & not to be fooled out of them againe\u2019; the Rump had to \u2018make good what we have so dearly bought, with so much hazard, bloud, & treasure\u2019.[CITATION-106] Cromwell levelled complaints against the Rump that chime with the army\u2019s stated grievances at the time. He criticised their \u2018designe to perpetuate themselves\u2019 and the \u2018scandalous lives of some of the chiefe of them\u2019; all \u2018these things\u2019 gave \u2018too much ground for people to open their mouths against them & to dislike them\u2019.[CITATION-107] As with the 1651 meeting, however, the conversation of November 1652 suggests that Cromwell was not only fed up with the Rump but also with the idea of sovereign unicameral parliaments. That is, his distaste for the Rump prompted him to question the constitutional arrangement settled in 1649. Specifically, Cromwell lamented the lack of restraints upon the Rump: they were \u2018lyable to no account to any nor to be controwled or regulated by any other power, there being none superiour, or coordinate with them\u2019. He predicted that \u2018unlesse there be some authority & power so full & high as to restraine & keep things in better order, & that may be a checke to these exorbitancies, it will be impossible in humane reason, to prevent our ruine\u2019.[CITATION-108] Beginning to catch Cromwell\u2019s drift, Whitelocke counselled obedience to Parliament: \u2018we our selves have acknowledged them the supreame power, & taken our Com[missio]ns & authority in the highest concernements from them, & how to restraine or curbe them after this, it will be hard to finde out a way for it\u2019. Yet Cromwell had a solution in mind. Suddenly, he asked Whitelocke to consider: \u2018What if a man should take uppon him to be king?\u2019[CITATION-109] Before examining Whitelocke\u2019s response to this searching question, it is worth pausing to consider how details in this conversation jar against what we know of events in the months that followed. Most obviously, the dissolution of the Rump was not the prelude to an alteration in the form of government or a power grab by Cromwell. The printed declaration issued by Cromwell and the Council of Officers two days after the dissolution stressed their commitment to government by sovereign unicameral parliaments. Prior to the dissolution, the officers and \u2018some of the Parliament\u2019, including Whitelocke, discussed an expedient whereby \u2018Supream Authority should be by the Parliament devolved upon known Persons, men fearing God, and of approved integrity\u2019. This was not a long-term solution; the assembly was entrusted with the \u2018Government of the Common-wealth... for a time\u2019 to carry out the reforms sought by the army. It would give the people time to \u2018forget Monarchy\u2019 and appreciate \u2018their true Interest in the Election of Successive Parliaments\u2019, thereby allowing the government to be \u2018settled upon a true Basis\u2019.[CITATION-110] Cromwell and the army were frustrated with the Rump Parliament, not with the rule of Parliament itself. They still hoped to secure that settlement first articulated in the 1649 Act abolishing the kingly office: government by successive, representative, parliaments without peril to the \u2018safety of the people that hath betrusted them\u2019.[CITATION-111] The Nominated Assembly was not considered a change of government; rather, it was meant to expedite pressing social, religious and legal reforms ahead of the return to government by elected parliaments in the not-too-distant future.[CITATION-112] Cromwell\u2019s call for checks and balances on the Rump in the conversation of November 1652 is more suited to the context of twelve months later, following the bitter experience of the failure of the Nominated Assembly and the foundation of the Protectorate. True, when defending theto the first Protectorate Parliament in September 1654, Cromwell argued that \u2018Government by a Single Person and a Parliament is a fundamental. It is the, it is constitutive\u2019.[CITATION-113] Yet, beyond Whitelocke\u2019s testimony, there is nothing to suggest that Cromwell saw things this way before the dissolution of the Rump. In late 1652 and early 1653 Cromwell and the army fixated upon the membership of Parliament, that is, ensuring that the right men were chosen, rather than restraining Parliament\u2019s legislative powers. They feared that elections under the Rump\u2019s bill for a new representative would return men of the same stamp as those time-servers who had frustrated the army\u2019s demands. The Nominated Assembly was a crude attempt to remedy this problem by creating a parliament in the army\u2019s image. As Cromwell later lamented in a speech to MPs in April 1657, the Nominated Assembly was \u2018a story of my own weakness and folly\u2019. It \u2018was done in my simplicity\u2019, at a time when Cromwell still naively believed that a packed assembly would get the work of reform done.[CITATION-114] The failure of that assembly demonstrated to Cromwell that controlling parliamentary membership was insufficient and that constitutional checks were needed to make government with elected parliaments work in the interests of the army. The result was thewhich not only set qualifications for parliamentary elections but also balanced legislative authority between the Protector and unicameral parliaments.[CITATION-115] If the details of the 1652 conversation fail to match the context, even more suspect is Whitelocke\u2019s response to Cromwell\u2019s searching question about kingship. Whitelocke told Cromwell that his proposed \u2018remedy\u2019 of taking the kingship \u2018would be worse then the disease\u2019. The title would \u2018be of no advantage\u2019 to Cromwell \u2018because you have the full kingly power in you already\u2019. As Lord General he controlled the \u2018Militia\u2019; in the \u2018nomination of civill officers\u2019 those he thought \u2018fittest are seldome refused\u2019; and even though he had \u2018no Negative vote in the passing of lawes, yett what you dislike will not easily be carryed\u2019. Overall, Whitelocke saw \u2018lesse envy & daunger, & pompe, butt not lesse power & reall opportunities of doing good, in your being Generall then would be if you had assumed the title of king\u2019.[CITATION-116] After Whitelocke\u2019s cold response, Cromwell probed further, claiming that he had heard \u2018some of your profession observe, that he who is actually king (whether by election or by discent) yett being once king, all acts done by him as king, are lawfull & justifyable\u2019. This was embodied in the 1495Act of Henry VII, which made it \u2018safer for those who act under a king (be his title what it will) then for those who act under any other power\u2019. Ultimately, Cromwell believed that the \u2018power of a king is so great & high & so universally understood\u2019 that it might \u2018indempnify in a great measure, those that act under it\u2019.[CITATION-117] Whitelocke was unmoved by these legalistic arguments; he put no trust in \u2018that Act of Parlement [of] ... H. 7. which will be little regarded or observed to us by our ennemies, if they should come to gett the upper hand of us\u2019.[CITATION-118] He warned Cromwell that if he became king then \u2018the question will be no more, whether our governem[en]t shall be by a Monarke, or by a free state, butt whether Cromwell or Stuart shall be our king & Monarke\u2019.[CITATION-119] On the face of it, this exchange might suggest that Whitelocke did little to modify his earlier opinions in his post-Restoration memoirs. After all, it hardly seems prudent for Whitelocke to admit that he claimed monarchy was of little value and that Cromwell was better off ruling without it. Yet it transpires that Whitelocke had not really given up on monarchy; rather, he dissuaded Cromwell, only to promote the idea of a Stuart restoration instead. With trepidation, he told Cromwell of \u2018private thoughts\u2019 that were \u2018not fitt or safe for me to communicate\u2019. When pressed by Cromwell to speak his mind, Whitelocke asked him to \u2018consider the condition of the King of Scots\u2019. Given his utter defeat at Worcester, Whitelocke believed that Charles \u2018& all about him cannot butt be very inclinable to hearken to any termes, wherby their lost hopes, may be revived\u2019. Cromwell should seek a \u2018private Treaty\u2019 with Charles by which \u2018you may secure your selfe, and your friends & their fortunes, you may make your selfe & your posterity as great & permanent to all humane probability, as ever any subject was\u2019. This treaty could remedy the constitutional ills that led to civil war, imposing \u2018such limits to Monarchicall Power as will secure our spirituall & civill liberties\u2019.[CITATION-120] In giving this advice, Whitelocke claimed to speak \u2018out of my affection & service to your Exc[ellenc]y & to all honest men\u2019.[CITATION-121] Cromwell, however, broke off the conversation abruptly, seemingly \u2018displeased with what I had sayd\u2019. Thereafter, Cromwell\u2019s \u2018carryage\u2019 towards Whitelocke was \u2018altered, & his advising with me, not so frequent nor intimate as before\u2019. Soon after, Cromwell sent Whitelocke away to Sweden \u2018that I might be no obstacle or impediment to his ambitious designes\u2019.[CITATION-122] Clearly, this account reinforces many of the same points as the 1651 meeting. It reaffirms that the discussion over monarchical government was ongoing in the early 1650s and had not concluded in 1649. The kingless government that Whitelocke helped to bring about was a stop-gap; his preference was, and remained, a restoration of monarchy with a Stuart candidate on the throne. Yet the account of the 1652 conversation was not simply a means to hide Whitelocke\u2019s activities under the kingless regime. It also helped Whitelocke to understate the role he went on to take during the Protectorate, particularly his central involvement in the offer of kingship to Cromwell in 1657.In 1660 Whitelocke\u2019s role in the offer of the Crown was inescapable. Not only was there proof enough in the Commons\u2019 Journal, there also emerged shortly after the Restoration an anonymous tract entitled, which demonstrated the extent of his support for Cromwellian kingship.[CITATION-123] This work purported to be a faithful account of the deliberations between Cromwell and a committee of ninety-nine MPs over Parliament\u2019s offer of the Crown in 1657. As the title-page announced, the case for Cromwell accepting the kingly title was \u2018Made good by the Arguments\u2019 of many MPs, including Whitelocke. Not only did this pamphlet mark the first time that a wider audience was exposed to the precise details of those debates, but it also contained what was then one of the lengthiest collection of words attributable to Whitelocke available in print. Indeed, Whitelocke, who was the chairman of the committee of ninety-nine MPs, has been suggested as the pamphlet\u2019s author.[CITATION-124] Recently, Ben Woodford has argued that the author was probably \u2018one of the committee members, as they had reason to print their pro-kingship comments in 1660\u2019.[CITATION-125] Claims of Whitelocke\u2019s authorship have been strengthened by the fact that the account of the kingship debates in his memoirs is conspicuously brief. In his manuscript \u2018Diary\u2019 he simply notes that when \u2018the Com[mit]tee attended his H[ighnes]s Wh[itleocke] spake to him uppon the point of the Title of King, giving reasons why he should accept of that Title, the Prot[ecto]r urged his reasons against it, & Wh[itelocke] replyed\u2019. He says no more, adding glibly that the \u2018whole debate is in print\u2019\u2014a clear reference to.[CITATION-126] We should be wary of taking Whitelocke\u2019s concision as a sign that he approved of\u2019s contents. Perhaps he was embarrassed by its publication. After all, the committee\u2019s spokesmen asserted not only the legal necessity of the kingly title, but also the security that it provideda Stuart restoration. Lord Broghill, for instance, urged Cromwell to accept the title because \u2018there is at present but a divorce between the pretending King and Imperiall Crown of these Nations, and we know that persons divorc\u2019t may marry again, but if the person be married to another, it cuts off all hope\u2019.[CITATION-127] These were hardly sentiments that Broghill and others would have wanted to publicise in 1660. Those who commented upon the contents ofquestioned the royalist credentials of the committee members. Summarising the pamphlet\u2019s contents in his acerbicof 1663, James Heath perceived that the \u2018main argument\u2019 for kingship was built upon theAct, \u2018by which all persons were indempnified that took up Arms for the King in being, which was one and the chief reason said Whitlock, why so many at first assisted the King against the Parliament, and would be his Highnesses care and security\u2019.[CITATION-128] As the introductory note \u2018to the Reader\u2019 ofsuggests, it was \u2018out of love to themselves, and [their] posterity\u2019 that MPs offered Cromwell the Crown.[CITATION-129] Woodford has argued that the printing ofwould have benefited those whose speeches it records because it \u2018aligned the committee members with monarchical government, regardless of which family wore the crown\u2019.[CITATION-130] But revealing oneself to be a supporter of monarchical government regardless of the family hardly proved one\u2019s loyalty to the restored Stuart monarch; thus, when the pamphlet was republished in 1680 during the Exclusion Crisis, its title was changed to. The committee of ninety-nine, the preface to the reprint explained, desired \u2018Oliver the late Usurper\u2019 to take the kingly title \u2018with an intent to exclude the Royal line\u2019; it was \u2018not Monarchy alone they first struck at, but the utter Exclusion of the Royal Line\u2019.[CITATION-131] Indeed, perhaps there is an alternative explanation for the publication ofin 1660. Rather than an attempt by Cromwellian confidants to save their political careers, its publication may have been designed to destroy them.[CITATION-132] This would explain why Whitelocke does not linger on the kingship debates in his memoirs. He rarely mentions the offer of the Crown explicitly, noting only in vague terms his efforts to \u2018promote the great buisnes of settlem[en]t of the Nation\u2019.[CITATION-133] He stresses that this was a work that he took no pleasure in. He grew \u2018tyred in this very great buisnes\u2019; he had \u2018much trouble ... in this great buisnes, uppon w[hi]ch he was putt by the L[or]d Broghill & others of his friends\u2019.[CITATION-134] Whitelocke studiously avoids stating his support for the scheme; he even \u2018declined\u2019 the \u2018first delivery of the Pet[itio]n and advice to the Parlem[en]t ... not liking severall things in it\u2019\u2014although he conspicuously fails to state what exactly he disliked.[CITATION-135] In 1660, as he struggled to defend himself against his enemies, Whitelocke\u2019s key defence was to emphasise both his good intentions towards the Stuarts and the suspicions that others harboured of his latent royalism. He claimed to have done his best in difficult circumstances; he upheld the law while secretly hoping for a Stuart restoration. The publication ofwas a hammer blow to those claims. Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs were, to a large extent, an attempt to repair the damage done to his reputation by that pamphlet.Whitelocke\u2019s account of his conversation with Cromwell in November 1652 seems designed to distract from the events of 1657. For anyone familiar with the contents of, the effect of reading this conversation would have been disorientating; the roles of Cromwell and Whitelocke in 1657 are reversed. On the one hand, Cromwell stresses the legal benefits of the kingly title, making arguments akin to those advanced in 1657 by the committee of ninety-nine, most notably the legal protection offered by the 1495Act. On the other hand, contrary to his speeches in 1657, Whitelocke plays down the legal necessity of the kingly title and claims that Cromwell has as much power, if not more, without it.[CITATION-136] Most importantly of all, whereas MPs recommended Cromwell take the Crown in 1657 to prevent a Stuart monarchy, in his account of the 1652 conversation Whitelocke urges Cromwell to shun kingship and to enthrone Charles Stuart instead.Yet just as it seems unlikely that Cromwell aimed at kingship in 1652, it is doubtful that Whitelocke advised the restoration of Stuart monarchy. For one thing, Whitelocke is inconsistent on this point. As already noted, when seeking to convince the Convention Parliament not to exclude him from the Act of General Pardon, he merely asserted that \u2018Cromwellhim to incline to the Kings restauration\u2019.[CITATION-137] One is left pondering why Whitelocke did not say more. If, as his memoirs claim, he had on at least two occasions\u2014in December 1651 and November 1652\u2014spoken in favour of a Stuart restoration, it would surely have benefited him to make those details public in 1660; to show he had explicitly advised Cromwell to restore Stuart monarchy, and not to leave his defence hanging upon the thread of mere suspicion.Rather, it seems that the details of the 1651 and 1652 meetings with Cromwell were fabricated, if not wholly invented, after Whitelocke\u2019s experiences at the hands of his enemies in 1660. This was not only a response to the emergence ofbut also a chance for Whitelocke to strike at his chief antagonist in 1660, George Monck. Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs demonstrated that he worked to bring about a Stuart restoration long before Monck ever had the wherewithal to pull it off. He invites the reader to consider whether Monck\u2019s actions were more opportunistic than principled. After all, in the 1652 conversation Whitelocke advised Cromwell to seek a private treaty with Charles II to secure his own interests and those of his friends. Monck in 1660 merely seized the opportunity that Cromwell failed to take in 1652: to make himself and his posterity \u2018as great & permanent to all humane probability as ever any subject was\u2019.[CITATION-138] The opportunistic and self-interested nature of Monck\u2019s actions was made more explicit in a later conversation in Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs, dated 22 December 1659, in the final days of the Committee of Safety. With Monck and his forces gathering on the Scottish border, Whitelocke advised Charles Fleetwood \u2018to send forthwith to the King att Breda, to offer to bring him in uppon good termes, & therby to gett before hand with Moncke\u2019. It was \u2018more prudence for Fletewood & his friends to be the instrum[en]ts of bringing him in, then to leave it to Moncke\u2019. By these means, \u2018Fletewood might make termes with the K[ing] for preservation of himselfe & his friends, & of that cause in a good measure in which they had bin ingaged\u2019; but \u2018if it were left to Moncke, they & all that had been done, would be left to the daunger of destruction\u2019.[CITATION-139] By the end of their meeting, Fleetwood resolved to \u2018send Wh[itelocke] to the K[ing]\u2019; but, upon leaving, Whitelocke \u2018met Vane, Disborow, & Berry, in the next roome comming to speake with Fletewood\u2019. Predictably enough, \u2018within a quarter of an hour, Fletewood came to Wh[itelocke] & in much passion said to him, I cannot doe it, I cannot doe it\u2019. Whitelocke\u2019s response was that \u2018you will ruine your selfe & your friends\u2019 and \u2018so they parted\u2019.[CITATION-140] Whether or not this encounter was another fabrication, it is striking how Whitelocke admits to advocating an accommodation with Charles II out of political calculation. Fleetwood had to beat Monck to Breda \u2018for preservation of himself and his friends\u2019 and to safeguard the cause for which they fought.[CITATION-141] All this echoes what Whitelocke advised Cromwell in 1652. In fact, it could be argued that both the 1651 and 1652 meetings provide necessary context for this later conversation, giving it a more favourable spin than if taken in isolation. After all, if Whitelocke only advised Charles II\u2019s restoration in late 1659, when the government was on the brink of collapse and the king\u2019s return seemed inevitable, then he was being just as opportunistic as Monck. If, however, Whitelocke could demonstrate that he hadsought to restore Stuart monarchy, and had advocated such a design on a number of occasions during the 1650s, then his advice in 1659 could be read in a more favourable light. It was Whitelocke\u2019s misfortune, so he claimed, that his designs were thwarted by the ambition of Cromwell in the early 1650s and the weak-mindedness of Fleetwood in 1659. As his defence to Parliament in 1660 explained, he was resigned to \u2018submit to what it pleased God to permit, & was not in his power to alter\u2019.[CITATION-142] Ultimately, Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs do not simply rewrite the political history of the Interregnum, they reimagine the road to the Restoration too. Having almost fallen victim to Monck\u2019s efforts to have him excluded from the Act of General Pardon, thanks in no small part to his own attempts in late 1659 to denounce Monck\u2019s plans to bring about Charles II\u2019s restoration, Whitelocke tried to turn the tables. Rather than being the man who almost let the cat out of the bag about Monck\u2019s intentions, Whitelocke suggested that he had long been striving to bring about what Monck only achieved at the eleventh hour. In his reinvention of events, it was Whitelocke who was the Stuart loyalist, not the opportunist Monck.This article has suggested that key episodes in Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs are fabrications designed to promote certain narratives that served his purposes after the Restoration. It might be asked whether Whitelocke, an eminent lawyer and devout puritan, was capable of devising and propagating such blatant mistruths. Despite the anomalies and discrepancies outlined here, without the clinching evidence of an earlier manuscript, written before the Restoration, it is difficult to prove conclusively that Whitelocke\u2019s activities and opinions at or nearer the time differed from those recorded in the \u2018Annales\u2019 and \u2018Diary\u2019. Whitelocke must have based his memoirs on a range of sources; it is inconceivable that he produced such detailed works from recall alone. Yet, as Whitelocke admits, the precautionary destruction of many of his papers in January 1660 left his account \u2018lesse perfect\u2019 than it might have been.[CITATION-143] One notable absence among Whitelocke\u2019s surviving papers is the \u2018journall of the affayres of my owne life\u2019, alluded to in the \u2018Annales\u2019, in which he set down daily \u2018where I was, with what company, in what intertainm[en]t & the like\u2019. He apparently kept this record until May 1649, when he decided to end the \u2018course of writing\u2019 it because he was feeling overwhelmed by the death of his second wife and \u2018weary & clogged with a multitude of publique buisneses\u2019.[CITATION-144] Clearly, this would have been a valuable source for Whitelocke when writing his memoirs, but it is not certain whether it was available to him. Given its coverage of the key period of late 1648 and early 1649, it was probably among the incriminating papers destroyed on the eve of the Restoration.[CITATION-145] Yet, while the materials upon which Whitelocke based his memoirs remain elusive, other manuscripts from before 1660 have survived. Particularly important are several volumes in which Whitelocke recorded his embassy to Sweden in 1653\u20134. As already noted, his role as ambassador was problematic for Whitelocke after the Restoration. Enemies claimed that the enterprise was an attempt to secure the kingless regime in Britain and to close off foreign support for the Stuart cause. Prior to 1660, Whitelocke amassed much material on the embassy, including a journal written at, or very near, the time of his journey and a more expansive, two-volume \u2018History Of Whitelockes Ambassy from England to Sweden\u2019, which fleshed out the earlier notes and inserted chapters on a range of political, religious and philosophical topics.[CITATION-146] Like Whitelocke\u2019s other writings, this was ostensibly for the instruction of his family, but there are hints that the notes were intended to justify his conduct to a wider audience.[CITATION-147] Internal evidence shows that the \u2018History\u2019 was written around the time of Richard Cromwell\u2019s Protectorate.[CITATION-148] After the Restoration, however, Whitelocke went through the text and amended it, deleting some passages and revising others. Many of those changes were incorporated into the post-Restoration iteration of Whitelocke\u2019s account, subsequently printed in 1772 as.[CITATION-149] Interestingly, in the \u2018Annales\u2019 Whitelocke mentions very little about his time abroad.[CITATION-150] Instead, he deliberately \u2018sett downe the passages relating to the Parlem[en]t & Army by themselves, & those relating to the Swedish Ambassaye by themselves, that both the one & the other may be the more cleerly & distinctly understood\u2019.[CITATION-151] The manuscript subsequently published as Whitelocke\u2019s journal of the Swedish embassy was thus intended as a companion volume to the corresponding section of the \u2018Annales\u2019, probably written at the same time, and employing the same editorial practices, as the rest of Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs.While there is insufficient room in this article to explore the various textual differences between the versions of Whitelocke\u2019s account of his embassy, a few examples will suffice to show that he not only made substantial alterations to his earlier notes of key conversations during the embassy, but that those changes amplified the narratives already identified elsewhere in his post-1660 memoirs. For instance, Whitelocke records a private meeting with Queen Christina on 5 January 1654. The pre-1660 account, in the \u2018History Of Whitelockes Ambassy\u2019, opens with Christina keen to discuss Cromwell and his family. Whitelocke assured the Queen that Cromwell was a \u2018gentleman of an antient & noble family\u2019, that his wife, Elizabeth Bourchier, was of a \u2018Noble & good family\u2019 and that their children were \u2018of good parts & liberall education\u2019. Whitelocke noted that the Queen \u2018seemed by this discourse which was large, to be convinced of the untrueth of some unworthy mention which had bin made of them to her\u2019. Then:Wh[itelocke] told her that much of the story of his Generall had some paralell in that of her M[ajes]auncestor Gustavus the first, who from a private gentleman of a Noble family, which her M[ajes]knew better then he, was advanced to the title of Marshall of Sweden, bicause he had risen up for the rescue of his countrey from the bondage & oppression, which the Tirant Danish King had putt uppon them, whome he as Generall of the Swedes had subdued, & expelled the Kingdome, & for his reward, was att last elected to be their King.The Queen approved of this comparison, saying that \u2018it was very true & a good paralel, & she believed, that Cromwell would be King of England in the conclusion\u2019. Whitelocke, who had not yet received news of the foundation of the Protectorate, responded that Cromwell could not be king \u2018bicause England was resolved into a Commonwealth to be governed as a free state without a King, & that Cromwell had already as Generall of all their forces both by land and sea a sufficient power & greatnes to content him\u2019. Christina was unconvinced, saying \u2018that hardly could any power or greatnes be called sufficient, when the nature of man was so prone as in these dayes to ambition\u2019. Whitelocke \u2018hoped that there was no such in his General\u2019. Yet, Christina felt \u2018that might easily be concealed, untill an occasion were given, & then it would show it selfe\u2019.[CITATION-152] The post-1660 renditions made significant alterations to this account. The opening part of the discussion was pared down, omitting the adjectives \u2018antient\u2019 \u2018noble\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019 when discussing the Cromwells and Bourchiers. In fact, despite Whitelocke noting in the earlier version that the \u2018discourse\u2019 about Cromwell\u2019s pedigree \u2018was large\u2019, the later versions offered no additional dialogue on this topic. Elsewhere, he disassociated himself from comments favourable to Cromwell altogether, such as his comparison between Oliver and Christina\u2019s great-grandfather, Gustavus I. Instead, Whitelocke placed his words into the mouth of the Queen. The edited text of \u2018Whitelockes History Of the Embassy\u2019 demonstrates his methods, deleting the words \u2018Wh[itelocke] told her\u2019 as well as the response to the speech where \u2018the Queen said that it was very true & a good paralel\u2019.[CITATION-153] The effect of these modifications, carried over into the printed version of the Swedish journal, made it appear that it was actually the Queen who told Whitelocke that:Much of the story of your generall hath some paralell with that of my auncestor Gustavus the first, who, from a private gentleman of a noble family, was advanced to the title of marshall of Sweden, bicause he had risen up and rescued his country from the bondage and oppression which the king of Denmarke had putt uppon them, and expelled the king; and, for his reward, he was att last elected king of Sweden; and I believe that your generall will be king of England in conclusion.[CITATION-154] In the earlier version, the Queen followed Whitelocke\u2019s lead in drawing a comparison between Cromwell and her ancestor. Her insistence that Cromwell would become king was not spontaneous but was prompted by Whitelocke\u2019s analogy. In the later versions, by contrast, Whitelocke\u2019s praise for Cromwell is glossed over, as is the fact that he first hinted at Cromwellian kingship.[CITATION-155] It seems that Whitelocke was again trying to deflect attention from the events of 1657. Asrevealed, Whitelocke made a speech on 16 April 1657 in which he urged Cromwell to take the kingly title in imitation of Gustavus I, \u2018a private Gentleman of a noble Family\u2019 who \u2018took up arms with his Countrymen against a Tyrant\u2019 and was first given the \u2018Title of\u2019, but afterwards \u2018their Parliament, judging it best to resume the old title, elected this Gentleman to be their King\u2019.[CITATION-156] By amending the later versions of his Swedish journal, Whitelocke complicated the picture, hinting that it was actually Queen Christina who told Whitelocke what he subsequently told Cromwell: that Swedish history provided a powerful exemplar of the necessity for Cromwell to take the Crown.The revised version of the conversation also emphasised Cromwell\u2019s ambition. In the pre-1660 \u2018History\u2019, Whitelocke told Christina that Cromwell \u2018could not be\u2019 king because England was a Commonwealth and he already had \u2018sufficient power\u2019 as Lord General. In the later, post-Restoration, version of the dialogue, the Queen then reiterated her point\u2014\u2018[r]esolve what you will, I believe he resolves to be king\u2019\u2014before adding, as in the earlier version, that the \u2018nature of man is so prone\u2019 to ambition. As in the earlier version, Whitelocke stated that he found \u2018no such matter in my generall\u2019, to which Christina responded that it might \u2018easily be concealed till an opportunity serve, and then it will show itselfe\u2019. In the original version Whitelocke did not comment on this, but after the Restoration he added a line of dialogue in which he conceded that \u2018All are mortall men, subject to affections\u2019.[CITATION-157] Before 1660, however, Whitelocke seems to have been much surer of Cromwell\u2019s lack of ambition. If, as he later claimed, Cromwell intimated desires of being king in November 1652, Whitelocke did not reveal this in his discussions with Christina. This is not to say that he was unwilling to divulge details of his private conversations with Cromwell to the Queen. In fact, in a subsequent conversation with the Queen concerning her abdication, Whitelocke reveals that \u2018a little before my comming out of England, my General told me, that he was resolved to quitt his charge, & to retire himselfe, from the which I endeavoured to dissuade him\u2019.[CITATION-158] Conspicuously, no record of this conversation can be found in Whitelocke\u2019s \u2018Annales\u2019 or \u2018Diary\u2019: the only conversation of substance recorded with Cromwell prior to Whitelocke\u2019s departure as Swedish ambassador, aside from the deliberations on the eve of the dissolution of the Rump, is that in St James\u2019s Park.[CITATION-159] If we are to reconcile this discrepancy in Whitelocke\u2019s testimony before and after 1660, we must accept that Cromwell sought the Crown at one moment only to contemplate retirement from public life at the next. It is often said that Cromwell had a split personality, but this seems unlikely: more probable is that Whitelocke invented one, or both, encounters. Clearly, it suited his purposes in the 1650s to emphasise Cromwell\u2019s lack of ambition, just as it was prudent to stress Cromwell\u2019s ambition after 1660. Less clear is which account was true, if either.In summary, the textual variations between the accounts of the Swedish embassy produced before 1660 and those produced later reveal editorial practices consistent with those suggested in this article for other parts of Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs. They demonstrate that Whitelocke was not above altering earlier records of conversations, even switching speakers to pass off his own opinions as those of others. That his interlocutor was still alive and able to contradict his version of the conversation should it have circulated more widely did not deter Whitelocke in this case.[CITATION-160] It makes it all the more probable that Whitelocke fabricated the words of those, like Cromwell, who were long dead. More broadly, the changes that Whitelocke made to the content of his post-Restoration account of the Swedish embassy tend towards the same narrative strategies identified in the conversations with Cromwell elsewhere in his memoirs. They suggest that Cromwell coveted power and that Whitelocke was set against the idea of Cromwellian kingship. Elsewhere in his Swedish journal, the text was altered to remove criticism of the Stuart cause, while passages where Whitelocke defended the change of government in 1649, and even the regicide, were expunged or heavily edited.[CITATION-161] Clearly, Whitelocke was not beyond fabricating or revising his past with an eye to the present. That he did so when writing up his notes of the Swedish embassy makes it likely that similar processes were at work with the \u2018Annales\u2019 too, of which the Swedish journal was a companion.This article has argued that Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs are far more treacherous than has been acknowledged. The many inconsistencies and incongruities in both the content and context of Whitelocke\u2019s accounts of meetings with Cromwell in 1651 and 1652 raise the strong probability that they are, at worst, complete inventions or, at best, the reworking of material borrowed from earlier and later events. The conference in 1651 echoes meetings held in late 1648; the conversation of 1652 is strikingly similar to the kingship debates of 1657.By fabricating these accounts, Whitelocke bolstered several claims first made in 1660, when he struggled to defend himself against exclusion from the Act of Pardon. Primarily, Whitelocke sought to affirm that Cromwell\u2019s seizure of power in late 1653, not the events of 1649, was the revolutionary pivot of the period. The settlement established in 1649, so Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs suggest, was nothing more than a stop-gap, as evidenced by the fact that conversations continued into 1651 and 1652 about constitutional settlement, with mixed monarchical solutions still foremost in the minds of Cromwell and many MPs. Whatever his involvement in the kingless Commonwealth, Whitelocke claimed that it was never intended to bar the way for the return of monarchy in the future.Linked to this, the accounts of the 1651 and 1652 meetings helped Whitelocke to demonstrate his enduring loyalty to the Stuart cause. While in 1660 Whitelocke merely claimed that Cromwellhim of harbouring a desire for a Stuart Restoration, in the memoirs he made plain to Cromwell those desires on not one, but two, occasions. This revelation was also designed to discredit his main antagonist in 1660, George Monck. In response to Monck\u2019s claim that Whitelocke had almost frustrated the whole business of the king\u2019s return, Whitelocke demonstrated that he always harboured hopes for a Stuart restoration. He had advocated such a course of action not only in 1659, but also in 1651 and 1652 when the royalist cause was at its lowest ebb following Worcester. Whitelocke suggested that he strove to bring about the Restoration long before Monck had the opportunity to do so.The account of the two meetings also strengthened Whitelocke\u2019s claim in 1660 that Cromwell schemed for power and that, consequently, he fell out of favour because he was an obstacle to Cromwell\u2019s ambitious plans. This narrative was dealt a blow by the publication of the kingship debates of 1657, which revealed that Whitelocke not only urged Cromwell to take the Crown but also that Cromwell had repeatedly refused that offer. It is therefore understandable that Whitelocke said little about the events of 1657 in his memoirs. That Whitelocke\u2019s \u2018Annales\u2019 apparently come to an abrupt end when the account reaches 1656 may indicate that the main narratives of Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs\u2014namely Cromwellian ambition and Whitelocke\u2019s latent Stuart sympathies\u2014became impossible to sustain in light of the details printed in.[CITATION-162] Whitelocke\u2019s account of the 1652 conversation was probably an attempt to muddy the waters.Once Whitelocke\u2019s accounts of the 1651 and 1652 meetings are discounted, however, the political history of the 1650s is transformed. Removing Whitelocke\u2019s evidence of backroom discussions over constitutional change in 1651, the kingless regime established in 1649 no longer seems like a stop-gap; there is little to suggest an appetite among MPs for constitutional change, much less for a Stuart restoration, post-Worcester. Much of the evidence outside of Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs, including the legal preparations for kingless government, the Act abolishing kingship, the Rump\u2019sof March 1649, the declarations against Charles Stuart in 1651, and the decision to export kingless government to Scotland after Worcester, undermine the notion that Whitelocke and others entertained mixed monarchical solutions and the enthroning of a Stuart king. The regime was not freewheeling, putting off the business of settlement for the future: the regime established in 1649, which Whitelocke helped to secure, was intended to besettlement. After Worcester, debate hinged uponwithin the existing constitutional arrangement, not aof government.True, a scheme to make Cromwell king emerged in 1657, but this was the product of developmentsthe dissolution of the Rump, not of a longing for such a solution among Rumpers, much less the secret machinations of Cromwell. Discounting Whitelocke\u2019s testimony, there is no evidence that Cromwell personally expressed a preference for the Crown. He did not even seek power in the first instance: the dissolution of the Rump led him to back the scheme for a Nominated Assembly to carry out necessary reforms, but his intention was to revert to government by unicameral sovereign parliaments thereafter. It was the failure of the Nominated Assembly that drove Cromwell and his allies to entertain constitutional arrangements that set up a single person to check Parliament\u2019s legislative authority. Even then Cromwell did not covet the Crown. The offer of kingship embodied in theof 1657 was devised by a number of Cromwellian acolytes, nervous about the regime\u2019s security should the Protector die suddenly, and a majority of Presbyterian MPs who saw kingship as a means to bind Cromwell by settling the government on a parliamentary footing.[CITATION-163] Yet, no matter how strongly Whitelocke and other MPs recommended such a scheme, Cromwell ultimately refused. Discounting Whitelocke\u2019s evidence, it seems most likely that Cromwell\u2019s refusal was the product of providential reasoning rather than political calculation. While Cromwell may have sought out solutions to keep monarchy in being in late 1648, once the decision was taken to abolish kingship he never sought to reinstate what providence had destroyed.[CITATION-164] Above all, this article suggests that scholars must reflect more on the ways in which the memory games played out in the Restoration era continue to taint histories of the 1640s and 50s. While some have suggested that Whitelocke did \u2018surprisingly little\u2019 to revise his \u2018own past with an eye to the present\u2019 or to omit \u2018potentially damaging material\u2019, it seems his methods were far more subtle and therefore less easy to detect.[CITATION-165] In the tense atmosphere of 1660, as Whitelocke struggled to save his life and livelihood, he concocted a number of claims to conceal or diminish his role in the events of the 1640s and 50s while conforming to many of the \u2018public\u2019 memories of the two decades that were propagated in official and semi-official print during the Restoration period. Whitelocke never denied his proximity to Cromwell or that he served the various regimes in the 1650s: these were too well known. Instead, he turned his position as a Cromwellian insider to his advantage, telling stories about private meetings that obfuscated much of the detail that was public knowledge.Even though Whitelocke\u2019s attempts to rehabilitate himself in his own lifetime failed, his literary efforts to reimagine the Interregnum, and his role within it, have had a highly influential afterlife. Echoes of the narratives that Whitelocke sought to establish in his memoirs, including the transient nature of the kingless Commonwealth regime, the ingrained and enduring support for monarchical government even among members of the Rump, and Oliver Cromwell\u2019s desire for the Crown, all still pervade historical studies of the period. Even where scholars look on Whitelocke\u2019s memoirs sceptically, they still broadly accept many of the stories that he told about the 1640s and 50s. As historians now consider the myriad ways in which the civil wars were memorialised and commemorated, it is worth reflecting on how the historical studies we write today are often themselves propagators of post-Restoration memories and narratives about the period.",
