    "article": "It is commonly supposed that all Anglo-Saxon laws were composed in Old English. This article argues that the law-code in the name of King Ine of Wessex (r. 688\u2013726) was written in Latin in his reign and only assumed its surviving Old English form in the ninth century when it was translated from Latin and appended to King Alfred\u2019s law-code. Linguistic evidence indicates that\u2019s language is that of a ninth-century translator, possibly working with Alfred\u2019s law-code, while its legal content is that of seventh-century Wessex. There are also several close parallels to continental legislation in Ine\u2019s laws, both in language and in content. This article suggests that these may be the result of Frankish legislation serving as a model for or inspiration to the makers of Ine\u2019s laws. The translation theory presented here explains many of the notorious linguistic peculiarities and problems of this text and its role within Alfred\u2019s code.\u2018Keine Spur l\u00e4sst etwa an einen Lateinischen Urtext denken.\u2019Felix Liebermann[CITATION-1] Anglo-Saxon kings issued their laws in Old English, or so goes the near universal assumption. This article aims to modify that view by presenting a possible exception: the laws of King Ine of Wessex (r. 688\u2013726). This unusually long and complex text presents a number of linguistic and legal oddities which suggest that it was originally composed in Latin.Ine\u2019s laws have always presented a puzzle, in part due to their curious textual transmission as a kind of appendix to the law-code of King Alfred, which was compiled around 150 years after Ine\u2019s reign.[CITATION-2] Ine\u2019s laws follow those of Alfred in all three manuscripts in which they appear,[CITATION-3] with no break in the chapter numbering.[CITATION-4] That said, Ine\u2019s portion is not integrated completely into Alfred\u2019s laws, as is indicated by a separate first-person preface in Ine\u2019s voice.[CITATION-5] In the scholarship, Ine\u2019s laws have therefore occupied an unclear position between independent text and constituent part, though no one has seriously questioned the authenticity of the text. Indeed, most scholars treat the extant version as a genuine Old English text in its own right, as suggested, for instance, by the fact that a majority of editors have chosen to present Ine\u2019s laws before Alfred\u2019s.[CITATION-6] I will argue here that the surviving version of the law-code does not represent the text issued by King Ine in the seventh century. From an investigation primarily of language, but also of legal content and manuscript transmission, it appears that these laws may originally have been written in Latin before being translated into Old English and appended to Alfred\u2019s law-code in the ninth century. Some of the linguistic evidence also reveals close parallels to continental legislation, and I will suggest that parts of Ine\u2019s laws may have been written following a Frankish model. This theory would explain the many oddities of the code and account for why its language is of the ninth century while its legal content is of the seventh. To make this case, I begin by reviewing the legal and linguistic basis for the dating of the extant Old English text (section I). In the two parts which follow, I argue for the existence of a Latin source text. The first part (sections II\u2013VIII) uncovers linguistic traces of an underlying Latin text and attempts to reconstruct some of the proposed lost Latin original. The second part (sections IX\u2013X) lends contextual support to the linguistic thesis by indicating how such a translation would fit into the Alfredian world and by proposing some motives for the production of Anglo-Latin law in the seventh century. In the conclusion (section XI), I discuss some of the wider implications of this theory, including those concerning the long-running debate about the reasons for putting law into writing in the early Middle Ages. I also consider how Ine\u2019s law-code should be used as evidence, arguing that its language must be considered in relation to Latin models and its concepts assessed in the context not just of seventh-century Wessex, but also seventh-century Francia and ninth-century Wessex.The assumption that the laws in Ine\u2019s name date from Ine\u2019s reign is a natural one. The manuscript transmission of the text has, however, required scholars to seek additional confirmation of that date in the code\u2019s legal content and linguistic form. It seems to have been taken for granted that both law and language must date from the same century, and this assumption has given rise to a tendency to see the idiosyncrasies of\u2019s language as seventh-century traits to match its seventh-century law. However, while the legal content seems likely to date from Ine\u2019s reign, the language does not appear to preserve anything that can be positively identified as seventh-century Old English.The starting point for dating the legal content should be the preface to the laws, which mentions Ine\u2019s advisors, bishops Eorcenwald and H\u00e6dde. This provides a date in the late seventh century, when both bishops were alive and in office.[CITATION-7] The next step is to assess whether the content could feasibly date from this period, a task which can be done partly through comparison with other laws. The available texts for such comparison are the later laws of Alfred, which provide a ninth-century contrast, and the three other extant legal texts from the seventh century: the laws of \u00c6thelberht (600 x 616), the laws of Hlothhere and Eadric (.685) and the laws of Wihtr\u00e6d (695), all kings of Kent. Comparisons of the legal content of these texts can be problematic, since they vary in scope and comprehensiveness and the degree of homogeneity between West Saxon and Kentish legal practices is unknown. That said, there are many similarities between the legal content ofand the other seventh-century laws, especially in terms of theft, religious transgressions and procedure.[CITATION-8] John Hines found \u2018a systematic variation which makes good historical sense\u2019 between the legal concepts found in the four texts, and noted, moreover, that the world they present matches evidence from archaeological and numismatic finds.[CITATION-9] Furthermore, there are many differences between the provisions inand those in Alfred\u2019s laws, especially in the penalties prescribed for similar offences, a fact which suggests that they do not originate from the same period.[CITATION-10] In general, then, there is no reason to doubt that the legal content is from around the time of Ine\u2019s reign.[CITATION-11] On the linguistic side, the situation is more complicated. As noted by Felix Liebermann\u2014the most influential editor of the Anglo-Saxon laws to date\u2014the witnesses to thetext conform to ninth-century orthography and inflection, and the assumption has always been that the seventh-century Old English was \u2018modernised\u2019 when the text was copied into Alfred\u2019s law-code.[CITATION-12] As a consequence, phonology is ruled out as evidence for the date of\u2019s language. The vocabulary does not provide much information either, since there are almost no other surviving Old English texts from the period, except for the three Kentish laws. Apart from the potential obstacle that these only survive in one twelfth-century manuscript,[CITATION-13] there are also very few significant similarities in vocabulary between them and.[CITATION-14] Most of\u2019s vocabulary is, however, relatively well attested in texts from the ninth century onwards, and there are no words, whether compounded or uncompounded (i.e. simplexes), with uncertain basic definitions. This is in contrast to the laws of \u00c6thelberht, which contain a number of simplex hapax legomena (that is, a word recorded only once) with no known meaning.[CITATION-15] Moreover, as Liebermann also noted,\u2019s grammar and syntax contain no clear indication that the text pre-dates the ninth century.[CITATION-16] As it stands, then, there is no positive evidence to suggest that the language ofis any older than Alfred\u2019s reign.The current scholarly assessment of Ine\u2019s law-code\u2014namely that it can be taken as a seventh-century text\u2014is based on non-linguistic arguments. Patrick Wormald\u2019s influential view was that thetext was left untouched by Alfred (apart from the cosmetic linguistic update), because Alfred would have removed those laws inthat contradicted his own had he made changes to the text.[CITATION-17] Like other scholars, Wormald assumed that the language was near enough original seventh-century Old English for the same reason.[CITATION-18] Others have argued more explicitly for a seventh-century date for the language, usually on the basis only of the text\u2019s linguistic quirks. This is the case, for example, with Frederick Levi Attenborough, who described the language ofin this way in his 1920s edition and translation of the early English laws:It is true that the terminology in general resembles that of later times and differs in many respects from the Kentish laws. But there are a number of terms which do not occur later, while in regard to others, we cannot be certain that they always bear the same technical meaning as in later times.[CITATION-19] Liebermann seems to have held a similar view, as he assumed that some of the rare words were old legal terms, which would have \u2018sounded archaic\u2019 by the 890s.[CITATION-20] Liebermann\u2019s and Attenborough\u2019s conclusions appear to stem from the many instances inwhere the context shows that the meaning of a word must be different from other attestations of it, or whereuses words which are absent from later laws (but occur frequently in other genres). There is, however, nothing about these words that makes it necessary to assume they are from the seventh century. Indeed, the argument presented here is that these oddities are not vestiges of a lost seventh-century vocabulary (technical or otherwise), but rather that they are the result of translation from Latin.This claim should not be surprising. Extant evidence suggests that prose writing in Old English only started in earnest in the ninth century, and it would thus be unexpected to see such a long and syntactically complex text as Ine\u2019s laws written in Old English as early as the late seventh century. While the seventh-century laws from Kent indicate that English was then in use for law-texts,[CITATION-21] their language choice does, of course, not prove that other texts must also have used Old English. In the end, the Old English prose of Ine\u2019s laws\u2014and indeed the text itself\u2014can only really be dated to the ninth century, and the question must therefore be whether the source underlying this ninth-century text was in Old English or in Latin. Latin is a good candidate not merely because the bulk of the other surviving Old English texts are of much later date, but also because there are concrete linguistic indications in that direction.Before presenting these traces of Latin, it is worth noting the different scenarios that could have produced them. Firstly, the whole code could have been composed in Latin. Secondly, some sections of the code could have been composed in Latin. Patrick Wormald believed thatwas a composite code made up of a core text issued in the 690s and additions accrued over the course of Ine\u2019s reign and possibly after.[CITATION-22] This is certainly a plausible context for proposing that some parts ofwere originally in Latin and some in Old English. However, I have identified traces of an underlying Latin text throughout the code, and have not yet found a concentration of Latinisms in particular sections, though more research into this possibility would be useful. Thirdly, and finally, the most conservative version of the thesis is that Ine\u2019s laws were written in Old English in the seventh century by an author who had Latin in mind. As we shall soon see, signs of mechanical translation speak against this, and, as the second part of this article will argue (sections IX\u2013X), there are reasons to believe that Alfred accessed a Latin, not Old English, version ofin the ninth century. Therefore, my proposal is that all of Ine\u2019s laws\u2014or at least a majority of its sections\u2014were composed in Latin in the seventh century. We can now turn to some of the most significant clues pointing in this direction\u2014and there are many more not covered in this article\u2014which cumulatively suggest an underlying Latin text.[CITATION-23] Our first trace of Latin appears to be the result of mechanical translation. In one of Ine\u2019s laws on theft, the word\u2018guilty\u2019 is used where\u2018guilty\u2019 or \u2018liable for\u2019 would be expected. The two words share one sense\u2014\u2018guilty\u2019\u2014butdoes not have the secondary sense \u2018liable for\u2019. This confusion could have arisen from a translation of a Latin word with both meanings, namely.The meaning of the relevant law is by no means straightforward:: Gif ceorl ceap forstil\u00f0 7 bire\u00f0 into his \u00e6rne, 7 befeh\u00f0 \u00fe\u00e6rinne mon, \u00feonne bi\u00f0 se his d\u00e6lbutan \u00feam wife anum, for\u00f0on hio sceal hire ealdore hieran: gif hio dear mid a\u00f0e gecy\u00f0an, \u00fe\u00e6t hio \u00fe\u00e6s forstolenan ne onbite, nime hire \u00f0riddan sceat.[CITATION-24] There are several uncertainties, but the issue at hand is whethershould be understood as \u2018liable for\u2019 or simply \u2018guilty\u2019, the former preferred in Attenborough\u2019s translation and the latter in Dorothy Whitelock\u2019s.[CITATION-25] The implicit claim in Attenborough\u2019s translation is that, which shares the meaning \u2018guilty\u2019 with, is here being used in another sense ofnamely \u2018liable for\u2019.[CITATION-26] with the sense \u2018liable for\u2019 is part of a standard phrase used to express compensatory and punitive payments in the laws of Alfred and later kings, butis not otherwise attested with this sense. A further problem with Attenborough\u2019s interpretation is the case of the associated noun (\u2018part\u2019), which\u2014ifis being used liketo mean \u2018liable for\u2019\u2014should be genitive or instrumental, whereas it appears in its uninflected form (i.e. nominative or accusative singular).[CITATION-27] Whitelock implicitly recognised the issues with the interpretation ofas \u2018liable for\u2019 and translatedas \u2018guilty for his part\u2019.[CITATION-28] However, there are no other attestations of such use ofeither and it seems no less necessary for this translation that the noun should be in the genitive or instrumental.The translation as \u2018liable for\u2019 does, however, appear to be the correct one: the final words of the law are somewhat unclear, but nevertheless show that it is a question of whether property is kept or not by the guilty party. Of course, we could merely be dealing with the result of some kind of scribal error; or perhaps we should assume thathad a sense of \u2018liable for\u2019 in early Old English which later disappeared, and that\u2019s archaic usage somehow escaped the modernising efforts of Alfred\u2019s copyists. But an alternative\u2014and less\u2014explanation is thatis a translation of, which shares\u2019s ability to mean both \u2018guilty\u2019 and \u2018liable for\u2019. In fact,is commonly used in compensation expressions in Frankish law in phrases such as \u2018iudicetur culpabilis duos denarios\u2019.[CITATION-29] This phrase is used extensively in thethe earliest version of which dates to the sixth century (known as the), in a context exactly parallel to that in whichis used in Anglo-Saxon law. The proposed Latin ofcould have looked like its continental counterpart; thephrase would then be evidence of a mechanical translation error, where the translator translated the wrong meaning of. This would also account for the non-inflected form of the noun, as\u2018to be judged liable for\u2019 appears to take an accusative noun in the continental texts.[CITATION-30] The putative Latin could be reconstructed thus: \u2018Si quis ingenuus furatus fuerit pecus et tulerit in domum suam, et inibi deprehensus fuerit, sit [/iudicatur] culpabilis partem suam\u2026\u2019.A similar error is found in the final section of, where chapter 70.1 opens: \u2018\u00c6t X hidum to fostre X fata hunies, CCC hlafa, XII ambra wilisc eala\u00f0\u2026\u2019.[CITATION-31] usually has the meaning \u2018food\u2019 andis attested with the sense \u2018as sustenance\u2019. However, both these options would leave us with an incomplete and essentially meaningless clause. Attenborough and Whitelock sought to remedy this by translatingas \u2018food rent\u2019, a sense unattested elsewhere.[CITATION-32] We could be dealing with yet another lost sense, but the confusion could also be cleared up with the Latin word. This has the meaning of both \u2018food, sustenance\u2019 and \u2018duty to provide food and maintenance\u2019, with the second meaning attested in English documents from the eighth century onwards.[CITATION-33] The Old English equivalent ofin the sense required to understand Ine\u2019s law is more likely to be\u2018food, food rent, levy\u2019, with the taxation sense attested in several charters and elsewhere.[CITATION-34] As with, it seems that a ninth-century translator might simply have translated the wrong sense of a polysemous Latin word.A different type of Latinism is found in\u2019s ordeal laws.\u2018basin, bowl\u2019 is used to denote the cauldron used for the ordeal by hot water and is arguably an Old English rendering of a Frankish legal term,\u2018cauldron\u2019. It is found in two clauses:: Se cirlisca mon, se \u00f0e oft betygen w\u00e6re \u00f0ief\u00f0e 7 \u00feonne \u00e6t si\u00f0estan synnigne gefo in[or:] o\u00f0\u00f0e elles \u00e6t openre scylde, slea him mon hond of o\u00f0\u00f0e fot.[CITATION-35] \u00deonne mon bi\u00f0 tyhtlan betygen, 7 hine mon bedrife\u00f0 to[or:], nah \u00feonne self nane wiht to gesellanne beforan[or:]. \u00deonne g\u00e6\u00f0 o\u00f0er mon, sele\u00f0 his ceap fore, swa he \u00feonne ge\u00feingian m\u00e6ge, on \u00f0a r\u00e6denne, \u00fee he him ga to honda, o\u00f0 \u00f0\u00e6t he his ceap him geinnian m\u00e6ge. \u00deonne betyh\u00f0 hine mon eft o\u00fere si\u00f0e 7 bedrif\u00f0 to[or:].

Within place ofthe two clauses would read:: The ceorlish man who is often accused of theft and then afterwards [one] catches [him] guilty in the *purchase [] or else in open guilt, one should strike off his hand or foot.: If a man is accused with an accusation and one forces him to the *purchase [], and he does not himself have anything to give instead of the *purchase [], then another man goes and gives his goods [] instead, on the terms on which he is able to settle, on the condition that he [the accused] goes into his hands until he is able to replace his goods []. When one accuses him another time afterwards and forces him to the *purchase [], if he who previously gave goods [] for him does not want to stand for him further and he then seizes him, then he loses his goods [], he who previously gave them for him.An accusation followed by \u2018forcing\u2019 someone \u2018to the purchase/transaction\u2019 does not make obvious sense within the Anglo-Saxon legal context. Furthermore, being \u2018caught guilty\u2019 in a transaction seems no different legally from being caught \u2018in open guilt\u2019, so it is difficult to see why the two should have been presented as alternatives. Linguistically, too, thereading is dubious: the second law has four additional occurrences of(with no variant readings) referring to goods of some sort. The potentially confusing use of the same word with two different meanings in such close proximity could be a sign that the original hadnotIn short, though neither clause is hopelessly unintelligible with thereading, it is not convincing.[CITATION-41] It seems, therefore, thatis the correct reading. Significantly for our purposes, there is an equivalent of this type of ordeal expression in Frankish law. The term, a variant spelling of(vessel of bronze, \u2018cauldron\u2019), is found in the.[CITATION-42] In this text, phrases containingclearly refer to some kind of ordeal, that is a court-mandated way of proving innocence or guilt involving offenders\u2019 hands (as seen in phrases such as \u2018ad ineum provocatus, manum incenderit\u2019).[CITATION-43] The verbs collocated withare\u2018to walk\u2019,[CITATION-44] and\u2018to summon, encourage\u2019, forming, as Liebermann noted, a parallel to\u2019s\u2018driven/forced to the cauldron\u2019.[CITATION-45] Finally, there is some circumstantial evidence for the suitability ofas a translation of: in the Alfredian ninth-century Old English translation of Gregory the Great\u2019s,is rendered as.[CITATION-46] No manuscript of the(or) is known to have existed in England, though it has been argued that copies could have been available early in the Anglo-Saxon period.[CITATION-47] But even without manuscript evidence, it is possible to establish relevant seventh-century contacts between Wessex and Francia. For example, the seventh-century West Saxon bishops Agilbert and Leuthhere were from Francia, and Leuthhere held his bishopric during the first part of Ine\u2019s reign.[CITATION-48] The two bishops mentioned as advisors in the preface to Ine\u2019s laws, H\u00e6dde (bishop of Winchester) and Eorcenwald (bishop of London), were English, but they both had continental connections: H\u00e6dde held Winchester jointly with Leuthhere and Eorcenwald seems to have undertaken at least one journey to Rome.[CITATION-49] What is more, Eorcenwald\u2019s name is cognate with that of a Merovingian mayor of the palace, Erchinoald (d. 658)\u2014who had family ties to the Kentish royal family\u2014and it has been proposed that the name similarity could indicate a familial connection.[CITATION-50] Another contemporary West Saxon churchman, Wine (.660\u201375), the first bishop of Winchester, was consecrated in Francia.[CITATION-51] And this is merely the tip of the iceberg in terms of connections between the seventh-century English church and the continent: many more are attested by the careers of the most famous churchmen of the age, Theodore, Hadrian, Wilfrid and Aldhelm. These personal connections suggest that Frankish laws could have been known in Wessex in this period, and copies of Frankish legal texts could have been in circulation there. If Frankish sources were available, then they would in all likelihood have been accessible to the bishops involved in making Ine\u2019s laws.Returning to the first of\u2019s ordeal laws with this possibility in mind, we can find similarities that are close enough not only to show thatis the correct reading and that it is derived frombut also to suggest direct influence from a Frankish text. One of the ordeal laws in thereads:Si homo ingenuus in furtum inculpatur et ad ineum prouocatus manum (suam) incenderit, quantum inculpatus fuerit, furtum conponat.[CITATION-52] And as we saw earlier,37 reads:Se cirlisca mon, se \u00f0e oft betygen w\u00e6re \u00f0ief\u00f0e 7 \u00feonne \u00e6t si\u00f0estan synnigne gefo in ceace o\u00f0\u00f0e elles \u00e6t openre scylde, slea him mon hond of o\u00f0\u00f0e fot.There are several linguistic parallels: \u2018homo ingenuus\u2019 (\u2018freeborn man\u2019) and \u2018se cirlisca mon\u2019 (\u2018theman\u2019; i.e. a freeman); \u2018in furtum inculpatur\u2019 and \u2018betygen w\u00e6re \u00f0ief\u00f0e\u2019; the past participle \u2018provocatus\u2019 and the temporal adverb \u2018\u00e6t si\u00f0estan\u2019 doing essentially the same work. The version inis more compressed, in that it only implicitly states that the accused is called to the ordeal through saying he was found guilty at the cauldron. Therefore, thephrase has no equivalent in Ine. However, Ine\u2019s way of expressing the offender\u2019s guilt has other Latin traces: the grammatically problematic phrase \u2018synnigne gefo in ceace\u2019 lacks the necessary pronoun or noun to go with, but it makes sense if interpreted in the light of the common collocations in Latin between\u2018hold, catch\u2019 and\u2018guilty\u2019 or\u2018guilty, accused (party)\u2019.[CITATION-53] Such constructions are seen, for example, in the sixth-century Edict of Theoderic: \u2018Qui bovem vel equuem errantem vel alius pecus abduxerit, furti magis reus tenendus est\u2026\u2019, or in the: \u2018Si autem domino iubente hoc fecerit, ad superiorem conpositionem dominus teneatur obnoxius\u2019.[CITATION-54] Finally, the differences in the sanction clauses could be explained as the result of different legal practices in Francia and early Wessex.[CITATION-55] With these parallels in mind, the hypothetical Latin version of\u2019s ordeal law might read: \u2018Si quis homo ingenuus in furtum saepe inculpatus tentus fuerit reus ad aeneum aut aliter in manifesto delicto, truncetur ei manus vel pes\u2019.There are further Latinisms in the second ordeal law (Ine 62). We might class among these the use ofwith the comparatively unusual sense \u2018instead of\u2019, rather than the common \u2018before/in front of\u2019.[CITATION-56] The meaning is clear from the rest of the law, namely that the accused party has the possibility of buying his way out of the ordeal, which is expressed as \u2018to gesellanne beforan ceace\u2019.[CITATION-57] A possible solution could be to see this word as a translation of Latinor, both of which have the sense \u2018before/in front of\u2019, but also \u2018instead of\u2019 with the ablative. Another instance is the rare phrase, \u2018accused with an accusation\u2019.[CITATION-58] This appears to be as odd in Old English as it is in Modern English, but could be accounted for by the Latin collocation of\u2018to accuse\u2019 and\u2018charge, accusation\u2019, where the noun is very frequently in the ablative case.[CITATION-59] A reconstruction of the first part of Ine 62 could therefore read: \u2018Si quis accusatus fuerit crimine et provocatus ad ineum nihil ne habuerit dare pro ineo\u2026\u2019. Such indications of underlying Latin constructions in the grammar seem to clinch the interpretation suggested by the use ofand the similarity in phrasing to the, namely that both of\u2019s ordeal laws were written in Latin after a continental model and subsequently translated.When God gave Moses his laws, he occasionally warned of the consequences of non-compliance with the words, \u2018let him die by death\u2019. In Old English, this phrase was commonly rendered asThis phrase is, for instance, used seven times in the prologue to Alfred\u2019s law-code, the bulk of which comprises several chapters from the Book of Exodus, translated from Latin into Old English. It also makes an appearance in. This is surprising, given that Ine\u2019s laws have no other biblical connections in language or content. I will argue, firstly, that this essentially Hebrew and Latin phrase is unlikely to have appeared in Old English inin the seventh century, and secondly, that the law in which it appears could have been borrowed from a continental legal text.The phrase is found in a clause prescribing the death penalty for theft:: Gif \u00f0eof sie gefongen,, o\u00f0\u00f0e his lif be his were man aliese.[CITATION-60] In the majority of its occurrences[CITATION-61] is a translation of the Latin, a phrase which occurs about forty times in the Bible, particularly in the Pentateuch.[CITATION-62] Perhaps as peculiar sounding in Latin and Old English as it is in Modern English, its origins and logic lie in a Hebrew construction\u2014an emphatic form combining the infinitive absolute with a perfect or imperfect form of the same verbal root.[CITATION-63] This type of construction does not exist in Latin, and Latin translations of the Bible kept theof the Hebrew by combining a finite verb with a noun in the ablative of the same root.[CITATION-64] In Old English, the phrase was constructed with two different roots, and the consistency with whichwas translated with these exact words seems to indicate that it became a standard phrase.In surviving Old English texts, the phraseoccurs fifty-three times in addition to the single instance in. Twenty-two occurrences are found in translations of the Bible,[CITATION-65] three in a translation of an apocryphal gospel,[CITATION-66] five in various other translations and glosses,[CITATION-67] thirteen in homilies,[CITATION-68] six in saints\u2019 lives[CITATION-69] and three in poems,[CITATION-70] and one under the year 1086 in the.[CITATION-71] Seven of the occurrences in translations of biblical passages are in the chapters from Exodus included in the prologue to Alfred\u2019s law-code.[CITATION-72] Of the occurrences in homilies, seven are found in quotations from the Bible, and five in passages translated from other Latin texts.[CITATION-73] The occurrences in saints\u2019 lives consist of one biblical quotation, and the rest translations of passages from other Latin source texts.[CITATION-74] Those found in poems are also based on Latin texts, with the occurrence in the poembeing a paraphrase of Daniel 2:12, that inof Genesis 5:24 and that inof a passage from her Latin saint\u2019s life.[CITATION-75] All the Old English sources where such occurrences are to be found are to varying degrees based on Latin texts, primarily the Bible, and forty-nine of the fifty-three occurrences have identifiable Latin equivalents.[CITATION-76] The phrases which theoccurrences translate are as follows: forms of(twenty-eight times);[CITATION-77] forms ofon its own (eight times);[CITATION-78] forms of other verbs of dying/killing (six times);[CITATION-79] and miscellaneous phrases with the \u2018mor-\u2019 root (six times).[CITATION-80] The primary association of the phrase is, therefore, with. Almost all thevariants translated in this way are found in Bible verses cited in non-biblical texts, as are about half the other verbs of dying and killing, indicating that the Old English translation into thephrase was influenced by the other biblical occurrences of. The occurrences ofas a translation of other phrases are found, with one exception, in homilies and saints\u2019 lives.[CITATION-81] Therefore, even when the Old English texts are the result of a free translation, the occurrences ofare almost always a response to a Latin phrase and almost always concerned with God and his laws. Its specific context is usually similar to that in which it is found in the Bible: it is the punishment for heathens, unbelievers, or those breaking God\u2019s commandments.The list of occurrences spans the entire Anglo-Saxon period\u2014though\u2019s is the only (supposedly) pre-Alfredian occurrence\u2014perhaps not making it a useful guide for our purposes. However, the usage distribution shows that the phrase appears consistently in a context of translation from Latin to Old English and one closely associated with the Bible over a long period. While it is therefore unsurprising in the prologue to Alfred\u2019s law-code, its use instands out. The context inis not one in whichappears in the Bible, since the Mosaic laws do not prescribe the death penalty for theft with these words. Theft is, however, one of the very few offences that do incur the death penalty in both earlier and later Anglo-Saxon laws.[CITATION-82] It seems unlikely that a supposed seventh-century writer ofin Old English would have used the Bible purely for linguistic inspiration while recording what seems to be a native legal practice, when there is no other evidence of either legal or linguistic use of the Bible in Ine\u2019s laws.Whether the hypothetical Latin text ofwould have includedor a single verb (most likely) is less clear. Some indication can be taken from a potential source of inspiration for Ine\u2019s laws, namely the(formerly the), a (possibly) seventh-century (conceivably) Breton law-text.[CITATION-83] It is relevant toin two ways: firstly, it includes a theft law very similar to\u2019s, and secondly, two of its other chapters useas a penalty clause.[CITATION-84] Chapter 27 in the A recension of thereads: \u2018Si quis ingenuus furtum fecerit et captus fuerit, ipse morietur\u2019.[CITATION-85] Apart from\u2019s compression ofto just \u2018thief\u2019, which could have happened at either the composition or the translation stage, these two clauses are remarkably similar.[CITATION-86] Another law on theft in thereads: \u2018Si quis agrum aut uillam conparauerit et ipse capitale furtum fecerit, morte morietur\u2019, and thephrase appears once more in a law on adultery.[CITATION-87] If the author ofwas mixing and matching, he could have constructed\u2019s theft law along the lines of the\u2019s Chapter 27, and taken the fullphrase from the second theft clause. Alternatively, it is possible that Ine\u2019s law was more or less a copy of something like27, usingonly, and that the biblical punishment clause was introduced at the time of the translation.[CITATION-88] The first of these is perhaps more convincing, given thatis very rare in secular legislative texts, but happens to appear in the same text as a near-identical version of\u2019s theft law. A reconstruction of Ine 12 in Latin could thus look like this: \u2018Si fur captus fuerit, ipse morte moriatur aut redimat vitam suam iuxta weregildum suum\u2019.Given the existence of a Latin model and the fact thatis always used to render a Latin phrase, it seems likely that the theft law inhas its origins in Latin. It is possible that this translation took place in the seventh century, though the case for the ninth century is supported by the standard use of the phrase at that time. The possibility that it was a standard phrase in Old English in the seventh century seems less likely, since there would inevitably have been a shorter period of usage, if indeed it existed at all. And the possibility that a seventh-century writer used this Latin- and Hebrew-derived phrase in a non-biblical context\u2014indeed a context in which this phrase was never used again in Anglo-Saxon England\u2014and, in so doing, happened to anticipate what would later become the standard Old English translation of a biblical phrase, seems less likely still.The very first line ofprovides another example of a Latinism:Ic Ine,Wesseaxna kyning, mid ge\u00f0eahte 7 mid lare Cenredes mines f\u00e6der 7 Heddes mines biscepes 7 Eorcenwoldes mines biscepes\u2026[CITATION-89] is essentially a Latin phrase, based on either\u2018by the gift of God\u2019 or\u2018by the grace of God\u2019. The latter expression seems to be a likely candidate, as it appears numerous times in surviving Anglo-Latin texts. Most significantly, it is found frequently in charters, where it functions as a way to introduce people and their office, usually in the opening line, just as in.[CITATION-90] Having said that, the Old English version (literally \u2018God\u2019s gift\u2019) is not rare either, with around 130 occurrences in the corpus of Anglo-Saxon texts.[CITATION-91] But the construction of the phrase inappears to be particularly Latinate: in most texts, the preposition used to express instrumentality is\u2018through\u2019, not. Only ten occurrences of the phrase useto express instrumentality, one of which is theclause.[CITATION-92] Of the remaining occurrences, three are found in the Old English translation of Bede\u2019s, with one of them in a phrase similar to the formula used in charters: \u2018Theodore mid Godes gife \u00e6rcebiscope\u2019, \u2018Theodore, archbishop by God\u2019s gift\u2019.[CITATION-93] A further three are found in charters, two in King Alfred\u2019s will, and one in a grant by Pope Sergius I to Aldhelm of Malmesbury.[CITATION-94] The will, the papal grant and one charter (S 914) exist in both Old English and Latin versions\u2014in the papal bull \u2018mid godes gife\u2019 translateson its own; in the charter S 914 the Latin equivalent is; and in Alfred\u2019s will, the Latin equivalent isin both occurrences.[CITATION-95] Another charter (S 333) in which this phrase appears may also be a translation from Latin.[CITATION-96] Charters were primarily written in Latin in the Anglo-Saxon period, and the ones written in Old English (which survive from the ninth century onwards) may be influenced by Latin formulaic phrases, which could be the case forin these instances.[CITATION-97] Another possibility is that the vernacular charters reflect the wording of oral declarations.[CITATION-98] Yet, sinceseems to be the more indigenous way of expressing instrumentality in this phrase, the instances withcould be a sign of a translation from Latin, where one of the available prepositions for translating a free-standing Latin ablative has been used. It seems that the introductory phrase inmight therefore have an underlying Latin text, which could be reconstructed as: \u2018Ego Ini gratia Dei rex Westsaxonum, consilio et doctrina Cenredi patris mei et Heddi episcopi mei et Eorcenwaldi episcopi mei\u2026\u2019.Another essentially Latin phrase inis\u2018as is fitting\u2019 (Ine 42). All the attested occurrences of the adjectiveare formed with \u2018it\u2019 and a form of the verb \u2018to be\u2019 in phrases similar to that in, and these appear almost exclusively in translations.[CITATION-99] occurs six times in the translation of Gregory the Great\u2019s, three times in the translation of Boethius\u2019s, twice in the translation of Theodulf of Orleans\u2019s, twice in the verse translation of the psalms, once in the prose translation of the psalms, once in a charter and once in.[CITATION-100] The Latin originals which thephrases translate include,,and.[CITATION-101] The basic construction of thephrases may be derived from Latin, since the more common phrases in Old English used to express the same meaning are formed in a different way. The two most frequent expressions with the meaning \u2018to be fitting\u2019 (vel sim.) areand, which have respectively around 300 and 600 occurrences (though not just in the sense relevant to this article). Both are impersonal verbs, functioning in similar ways toor.[CITATION-102] In fact, none of the other synonymous terms for \u2018be fitting\u2019 listed in the Old English Thesaurus are formed with the verb \u2018to be\u2019 and an adjective in the same way as thephrase. It is therefore possible that this phrase inis indication of an underlying Latin expression formed with\u2018to be\u2019 and an adjective, for example.The charter occurrence could indicate that the phrase was in more common use outside of a Latin context. That said, it is also tempting to see some kind of wordplay determining the use ofin the charter (S 1200), as it follows on almost directly from the use of the noun\u2018kindred, family\u2019: \u2018Nis E\u00f0elmode enig meghond neor \u00f0es cynnes \u00f0anne Eadwald his modar his bro\u00f0ar dohtar. Mest cyn \u00f0et\u2026\u2019.[CITATION-103] Elsewhere in this very short charter, one of the individuals involved, Cynethryth, is referred to by the shortened form \u2018Cyne\u2019, a further play on the cyn- root. It seems therefore that special circumstances dictated the use of thephrase in the charter, and that its primarily use was to render Latin.[CITATION-104] The termhas created legal confusion about the clauses in which it appears, though this confusion might be resolved by interpreting it in the light of a Latin equivalent,. The Old English word is only attested in translations and in, where it appears in a section on fighting in someone\u2019s house.[CITATION-105] It is used to denote what seems to be one of the lower orders of society, and both Alfred\u2019s laws and Ine\u2019s provide statements on the topic:: Gif \u00f0onne onhuse o\u00f0\u00f0e on gebures gefeohte, CXX scill. to wite geselle 7 \u00feam gebure VI scill.[CITATION-106] : Gif hwa on cierlisces monnes flette gefeohte, mid syx scill. gebete \u00f0am ceorle.[CITATION-107] Apart from\u2019s inclusion of the 120 shilling fine, these clauses cover the same material and stipulate the same compensation. Alfred\u2019s, that is a(a normal freeman), is relatively well attested in the laws and elsewhere.[CITATION-108] However,\u2019s\u2014a compound of\u2018tribute, rent\u2019 and\u2018payer\u2019\u2014is rare, with fifteen occurrences in the surviving Old English corpus. In thecontext, it is translated \u2018taxpayer\u2019 (Attenborough), \u2018rent-payer\u2019 (Whitelock), and \u2018Abgabenpflichtige\u2019 (\u2018taxpayer\u2019; Liebermann).[CITATION-109] The only attested occurrences of the word with this sense are in.[CITATION-110] has both the meanings \u2018rent\u2019 and \u2018tribute\u2019, and it is the second sense which dominates the use ofin its remaining occurrences.[CITATION-111] These are all in the sense of \u2018tributary, payer of tribute\u2019, usually in the context of peoples being subjugated. They are found in the translations into Old English of Orosius\u2019s(six occurrences), of various books of the Bible (three occurrences), of Bede\u2019s(two occurrences), of a liturgical work of Amalarius of Metz (one occurrence) and in a gloss of a Latin text (one occurrence).[CITATION-112] In Orosius,translates different words, including,,, always with the sense of peoples or cities being made tributaries to Rome.[CITATION-113] The two occurrences in Bede translate(as an adjective), and both are in the context of Anglo-Saxon kings subjugating other peoples in the British Isles.[CITATION-114] Two of the biblical instances and that in Amalarius translate\u2018debtor\u2019, another biblical occurrence renders the phraseand the gloss is for\u2018usurer\u2019.[CITATION-115] Two of \u00c6lfric\u2019s homilies feature the variant: once while citing Luke 7:41 (for) and twice in a homily where it is used to translateand.[CITATION-116] The oddity here is not just\u2019s exclusive use in translations from Latin, but also the question of what it means in the legal context. It is never used in another source to denote an Anglo-Saxon freeman. In, it appears alongside, which is slightly more common, with its twenty-four occurrences in the corpus primarily in glosses and translations as well as in some administrative documents.[CITATION-117] is usually taken to refer to a \u2018free but economically dependent peasant\u2019, and in thecontext it is translated \u2018Bauer\u2019 (\u2018farmer\u2019) by Liebermann, while Whitelock and Attenborough leave it as \u2018\u2019 and supply explanations in notes.[CITATION-118] Whitelock proposed but rejected the notion that\u2019s fighting law aimed to cover two types of peasant\u2014those who held land from a lord and paid dues and services () and those who farmed land of their own ()\u2014and ultimately she concluded that both words were probably referring to the same class of people: \u2018one who holds land from a lord at a rent\u2019.[CITATION-119] Attenborough suggested that they were two separate categories and thatreferred to a peasant who held a hide of land, as \u2018one of the commonest Latin terms for \u201chide\u201d is, which strictly speaking appears to be a translation of\u2019.[CITATION-120] The equation ofwithhas been made both before and after Attenborough, on the basis both of the equivalence betweenandand, as Attenborough points out, the connection to the hide.[CITATION-121] I would suggest thatis a translation ofand not the other way around, and not necessarily with reference to a hide. It is also possible thatis a translation of, a word whichfrequently glosses and translates and which may have had a connection with.is used as an adjective with the meaning \u2018subject to tax, tribute\u2019, but also as a noun, \u2018one who pays tax, tribute\u2019, which is the meaning of the Old English compound. The Old English term is formed from a noun (\u2018tribute, rent, tax\u2019) and a deverbal agent noun (\u2018payer\u2019 from\u2018to pay\u2019), which is a common way to make compounds in Old English. While some examples of this compound construction might go as far back as the early Germanic layers of the language, it continued to be productive throughout the period and new noun + deverbal noun compounds were formed freely.[CITATION-122] In particular, it was often used to translate Latin agent noun simplexes:was translated into\u2018roof-builder\u2019,into\u2018whale-hunter\u2019 andinto\u2018wage-payer\u2019, to take just a few examples.[CITATION-123] as a translation ofis therefore wholly in line with comparable Latin and Old English word forms.What is more, the wordas well asseem to have been used for (types of) freemen in Roman Britain and early Anglo-Saxon England, which makes it plausible that these Latin words were used in Ine\u2019s laws in the seventh century. Evidence forandas designations for groups in Britain is first found in the, in an edict issued by Emperor Constantine to Pacatianus, Vicar of Britain, in 319:Unusquisque decurio pro ea portione conveniatur, in qua vel ipse vel colonus vel tributarius eius convenitur et colligit; neque omnino pro alio decurione vel territorio conveniatur.[CITATION-124] In this provision on tax liability,andare listed as groups under a Romanand are seemingly distinct from each other.[CITATION-125] The exact legal and societal implications of the termsandin Roman law and history are much debated, but the basic sense ofwas \u2018tenant farmer\u2019, that is, someone cultivating the land who was in some kind of relationship of dependency with a landlord.[CITATION-126] In Anglo-Saxon England, the Roman termwas known and associated with the, for example by glossators of Aldhelm and Isidore.[CITATION-127] is, on the other hand, rarer in Roman law, but refers in general to a \u2018tax-payer\u2019.[CITATION-128] It is unknown whether Constantine\u2019s rescript used it to refer to a more specific system in Britain, though it does seem to be included to cover something whichdoes not.in Britain are also mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus, a fourth-century Roman historian, though perhaps with no more specific a meaning than \u2018tax-payer\u2019.[CITATION-129] It might also be relevant to note thatappears in some of the early continental laws, such as theand.[CITATION-130] As mentioned, the termappears frequently in early Anglo-Saxon charters and other texts (including Bede) as a land measurement referring to a hide.[CITATION-131] In one eighth-century charter, it is also used to refer to a group of people.[CITATION-132] This charter refers to bothandas groups of peasants, though in a way which may imply that the terms were interchangeable: it states that boundary clauses ought to be put in writing, because when they are not, disputes arise \u2018inter tributarios uestros nostrosque colonos\u2019, \u2018between yourand our\u2019.[CITATION-133] The change of term might just be for stylistic purposes, but it nevertheless shows thatwas used to refer to a category of freeman in early Anglo-Saxon England.[CITATION-134] This shows that the termwas in use not long after Ine\u2019s reign (which is more than we can say for).[CITATION-135] Taking this into account, the original law might have read something like this: \u2018Si quis pugnaverit in domo tributarii [aut coloni], exsolvat poenas CXX solidorum et colono VI solidos\u2019.[CITATION-136] Another rare word,, is found in a section on the sizes of groups of criminals. First,stipulates that a group with up to seven people is called\u2018thieves\u2019, between seven and thirty-five a\u2018band, troop\u2019, and over thirty-five a\u2018army\u2019 (Ine 13.1).[CITATION-137] The subsequent clauses give details on the oaths needed to clear one\u2019s name of such accusations, with the phrases \u2018se \u00f0e hlo\u00fee betygen sie\u2026\u2019 and \u2018se \u00f0e hereteama betygen sie\u2026\u2019.[CITATION-138] Whitelock translated the latter \u2018he who is accused of [taking part in] the raid of any army\u2019, Attenborough \u2018he who is accused of taking part in a raid\u2019 and Liebermann \u2018wer [der Theilnahme an] Heerpl\u00fcnderung bezichtigt ist\u2019 (\u2018he who is accused of [participation in] the plundering of an army\u2019).[CITATION-139] Seemingly following these interpretations, thegives\u2019s occurrence ofa separate sense (\u2018the act of taking part in a\u2019), distinct from the senses of the four other occurrences (\u2018booty, spoils, devastation\u2019).[CITATION-140] has the meaning \u2018army\u2019, but also the less frequently attested meaning \u2018plundering\u2019, and it is the latter which has commonly been accepted as the sense intended in.[CITATION-141] However, as we have seen,was used only a sentence before, unmistakably referring to \u2018army\u2019 (13.1)\u2014in fact, defining the number of people needed to make up an army\u2014perhaps making it unlikely that the word should suddenly shift to this much less common sense.The second element of the compound,has several meanings, among them \u2018line of offspring\u2019 and \u2018line of animals harnessed together\u2019.[CITATION-142] The second sense can be rendered as \u2018bringing into line\u2019 or \u2018yoking together\u2019, which would give the meaning \u2018mustering/bringing together an army\u2019 for.[CITATION-143] This fits the meaning ofmuch better than \u2018taking part in raiding\u2019, where the second element has presumably been interpreted with the dubious meaning \u2018being productive, teeming\u2019.[CITATION-144] Furthermore, while not necessarily secure evidence for the meaning of an Anglo-Saxon legal term, support could be provided by the, a twelfth-century translation of the Anglo-Saxon laws into Latin, which givesfor.[CITATION-145] In theis given the senses: (1) hire and (2a) gathering, muster, \u2018manred\u2019, (b) (?) marauding, (c) leadership\u2019.[CITATION-146] The difficulty is that sense 2b \u2018marauding\u2019 only has one citation, namely thetranslation of Ine\u2019s law. There is, therefore, no reason to suppose that the sense \u2018muster\u2019 was not intended. All in all, this would then suggest that Ine\u2019s law was setting out the procedure to clear oneself of an accusation of having gathered a, not of participating in one.The reason this might be relevant for the Latin translation theory is that a parallel is found in the, and the phrase used there may clarify the construction and meaning of the word. Theclause in question opens: \u2018Si quis collecto contubernio hominem ingenuum in domo sua adsallierit\u2026\u2019.[CITATION-147] It would be reasonable to infer that the person in question was responsible for the gathering of the\u2018gang, company\u2019, even though it is not explicitly said. The ablative absoluteis constructed only slightly differently from\u2019s phrase and both are made up of a noun and a deverbal element and both mean the same. This Frankish equivalent may therefore explain the meaning of this ill-understood compound as well as how it made its way into.With the linguistic observations of sections II to VIII in mind, we can now more securely assess\u2019s textual transmission. Two factors have in large part determined the modern scholarly understanding of Ine\u2019s laws: their transmission alongside Alfred\u2019s laws and the legal relationship between the two texts. In the prologue to his law-code, Alfred tells us in his own voice that he used Ine\u2019s laws as a source for the code in his own name.[CITATION-148] This surely does not simply refer to the inclusion of the completetextual block, because Alfred\u2019s own portion of the code contains many close overlaps with, for example on\u2018forcible entry\u2019, church sanctuary, changing lords or districts, fighting, felling trees, homicide, the celebration of Sundays and holidays and damage caused by animals.[CITATION-149] In some of these areas, the compiler behind Alfred\u2019s code made adjustments and changed details, such as the value of fines, though the indebtedness toat the level of law itself is very clear.Despite the reliance onin Alfred\u2019s portion of the code, there is a conspicuous lack of linguistic similarity between clauses that appear both in the completetext and in Alfred\u2019s portion. One example is provided by the law against fighting in the king\u2019s dwelling, which Alfred (or the compiler behind his code) must have copied from. It is rendered by Alfred as \u2018Gif hwa in cyninges healle gefeohte o\u00f0\u00f0e his w\u00e6pn gebrede 7 hine mon gefo, sie \u00f0\u00e6t on cyninges dome swa dea\u00f0 swa lif swa he him forgifan wille\u2019.[CITATION-150] The corresponding law inreads: \u2018Gif hwa gefeohte on cyninges huse, sie he scyldig ealles his ierfes 7 sie on cyninges dome hw\u00e6\u00f0er he lif age \u00fee nage\u2019.[CITATION-151] Despite the adjustment in legal details in Alfred\u2019s version, the two laws are essentially the same in content and basic linguistic construction. That makes the differences in vocabulary and phrasing stand out all the more. Of course, Alfred could have rewritten Ine\u2019s law in subtle ways that do not change the meaning of the law. But a more satisfactory solution to the problem is that Alfred used the Latin version ofas his source, and that the two clauses therefore represent two different translations of the same Latin original.The law on fighting in the house of a() and a(Alfred) has similar kinds of similarities and differences: \u2018Gif \u00f0onne on gafolgeldan huse o\u00f0\u00f0e on gebures gefeohte\u2026\u2019 (Ine 6.3) and \u2018Gif hwa on cierlisces monnes flette gefeohte\u2026\u2019 (Af 39). Again, Alfred\u2019s use ofin making this law is unmistakable both in legal detail and in the order of elements, but the lack of similarity in vocabulary stands out.[CITATION-152] Again, both Alfred and Ine\u2019s versions could reasonably be translations of what I suggested above might be the underlying Latin of Ine 6.3 (\u2018Si quis pugnaverit in domo tributarii\u2026\u2019). The clauses on\u2018forcible entry\u2019 offer a similar example. Alfred\u2019s law reads \u2018Cyninges burgbryce bi\u00f0 CXX scill. \u2026\u2019, while Ine\u2019s starts \u2018Burgbryce mon sceal betan CXX scill. kyninges 7 biscepes\u2026\u2019.[CITATION-153] The discrepancy in legal content does not necessarily account for the different syntax of Alfred\u2019s law. Variations of the same phenomenon are apparent to various degrees in another law on fighting as well as the laws on trees, changing districts, killing an innocent man and church sanctuary.[CITATION-154] The Latin translation theory provides a simple explanation: Alfred could have used the Latin version of Ine\u2019s law in making his own, leaving a text with the same general linguistic constructions, order of elements and legal content as the completetext, but with differences in vocabulary and phrasing.[CITATION-155] The Latin theory might also suggest some possible reasons whywas included as a full text by the makers of Alfred\u2019s code, the only one of its three stated sources to be treated in this way. As mentioned, in the final passage of the prologue to the law-code, Alfred, speaking in the first person, explained that he had borrowed from the laws of his predecessors King Ine of Wessex, King Offa of Mercia and King \u00c6thelberht of Kent.[CITATION-156] Nothing seems to be directly copied from the two other sources and there are fewer close correspondences than with, though their legal influence is apparent.[CITATION-157] The fact that onlywas both used in the making of Alfred\u2019s own laws and included as a separate textual block suggests that it was somehow different. That difference could, of course, be that it was the only West Saxon law of the three\u2014the importance of which is seemingly acknowledged by Alfred, as he places Ine first in his list of the three kings, rather than ordering them chronologically\u2014but it could also be thatwas included because it otherwise only existed in Latin.[CITATION-158] An alternative explanation is suggested by Wormald\u2019s theory that the extant text of Ine\u2019s laws was made up of separate decrees issued over the course of the king\u2019s reign, and potentially the reigns of his successors, perhaps finding its current form only by Alfred\u2019s time.[CITATION-159] As I suggested in section I, this could mean that only some parts ofhad originally been in Latin. The makers of Alfred\u2019s code may thus have included theblock as a way to bring together originally discrete texts, and translated its Latin sections into Old English to ensure linguistic conformity.[CITATION-160] There is a wider context which explains why Alfred may have sought such conformity in legislation. That is the Alfredian translation project, so called because of the king\u2019s explicitly stated intention to make Latin texts accessible in Old English.[CITATION-161] Alfred saw a need for vernacular versions of important texts, and the laws of his predecessor might reasonably have been considered a candidate for such an effort. Another text in this project is the prologue to Alfred\u2019s code, with, as we have already seen, its translation of several chapters of the Book of Exodus. Indeed, both the prologue and Ine\u2019s laws share much vocabulary with other Alfredian texts.[CITATION-162] Such similarities and the existence of a translation project do not offer proof of\u2019s Latin origins, nor do they fully explain its inclusion in the law-code. Nevertheless, the project does provide one plausible motivation for such a translation and therefore some circumstantial support. Moreover, it has the benefit of clearing up one of the long-standing puzzles surrounding Alfred\u2019s and Ine\u2019s laws, namely why there are duplications and contradictions between these two portions of the law-code.[CITATION-163] Ifwas included as a source text rather than as an integrated part of Alfred\u2019s laws, legally incongruous overlaps are not a problem at all.[CITATION-164] The final\u2014and most conjectural\u2014piece of contextual support is lent by Alfred\u2019s post-Conquest reputation. Alfred was remembered in the twelfth century as a translator of Latin texts in general, but the twelfth-century historian Geoffrey of Monmouth attributed to Alfred the translation into Old English of two (non-extant) British law-codes, at least one of which was said to have been in Latin.[CITATION-165] These stories may well have been fabricated by Geoffrey, though perhaps they had some basis in truth and may suggest that Alfred was associated specifically with the translation of Latin law.[CITATION-166] Speculations about the potential continental origins of or Latin models for English law make occasional appearances, but almost always in the context of \u00c6thelberht\u2019s laws.[CITATION-167] has so far escaped this kind of attention, perhaps because of the modern scholarly assumption that the Anglo-Saxon tradition of law-making in the vernacular was already established by the late seventh century.[CITATION-168] That is not an assumption we should make. There are just over a thousand words contained in surviving law-texts pre-dating Ine\u2019s reign and that total is only doubled if we add the laws of Ine\u2019s contemporaries. It is entirely possible that texts have been lost, but, for all we know, such lost texts could have been in English or in Latin.[CITATION-169] Thus, we have no good reason to consider vernacular law-writing an immutable tradition at this time. In addition, the surviving material means that all we can say is that vernacular law-writing was a Kentish tradition. We cannot assume that a king of Wessex would feel bound by the language of no more than three generations of intermittent law-making in a different kingdom.That does not, however, explain why or how Ine had his laws written in Latin. Potential motives are many and hard to pin down. Wormald\u2019s early theory for why law was put into writing at all saw the practice as an ideological emulation of Frankish kings and an acknowledgement that a Christian king ought to be in possession of written laws in accordance with the biblical and Roman model.[CITATION-170] The prologue to Alfred\u2019s law-code, with its translation of Mosaic laws, shows the most obvious evidence of a sense of affinity between the laws of the Bible and the Anglo-Saxons\u2019 own laws, but it is reasonable to think that a similar connection had been made earlier. Contacts with Frankish kings and churchmen were frequent enough for us to assume that Anglo-Saxon royalty must have had some knowledge of the existence of continental codes; the clergy would, of course, have been familiar with the already extensive Latin legislation of the church. In fact, even Roman law seems to have been taught at the school in Canterbury at the time of Ine\u2019s reign.[CITATION-171] Awareness of the laws of the Bible, the Romans, the Franks and the Church may have inspired an ambitious king like Ine to issue his laws in Latin.[CITATION-172] The opportunity to do so could have been provided by his bishops, Eorcenwald or H\u00e6dde, who might have had the knowledge and skill to compose a text of the sort that I propose existed in Ine\u2019s name. Their knowledge could, as I have indicated, have come from texts brought by some of their Frankish predecessors, a possibility which is strengthened by what appear to be near direct borrowings from continental texts. A copy of a continental law-code might have provided both an inspiration for Ine\u2019s code as a whole and a direct source for some of its clauses. In terms of linguistic practicalities, there is no reason to doubt that the bishops (or someone in their circle) could write this kind of Latin prose. The bishops\u2019 personal skills are unknowable, but a figure like the famous Latinist Aldhelm indicates that high levels of Latinity were achievable in late seventh-century Wessex.[CITATION-173] With possibility, motivation and skill plausibly accounted for, the time has come to return to the issue set out in section I, namely exactly what kind of influence produced the Latinisms in Ine\u2019s laws. The alternatives raised earlier included the suggestion that the whole text or some sections had been originally composed in Latin or\u2014a more minimalist option\u2014that it was written in Old English by someone influenced by Latin. And indeed, the second option could account for Latinate expressions and loan-words such asand. However, that possibility is significantly weakened by two factors: firstly, Alfred\u2019s rendering of laws copied from, and secondly, what seems to be mechanical translation producing incorrect or unidiomatic Old English.As I showed above, Alfred andsometimes state the same laws. When they do, the basic legal meaning and linguistic constructions are similar, but the phrasing and vocabulary are different. In fact, the phrasing differs in such ways as one might expect when an (Old) English speaker is faced with, say, a tricky Latin participle or verb in the subjunctive, and the vocabulary differences are within the expected variation for translation of a single Latin word. It is therefore possible to say that Alfred seems not to have used an Old English copy of, which suggests thatwas extant in Latin in the ninth century.Mechanical translation is evident in phrases such as,andSome of these produce what appears to be unidiomatic Old English and some are simply wrong. A writer who is merely influenced by Latin is liable to use loan-words and loan-phrases. They are, however, much less likely to include Latinate constructions and collocations. That is because such constructions do not arise from calques or word-for-word translation, but represent subconscious influence from the source language (in this case Latin) and are thus unlikely to occur when a native speaker is composing his own text.[CITATION-174] Such traces of underlying Latin are better explained by proposing that the surviving text was written by a translator who was occasionally too influenced by the source text to find the correct phrases and collocations in Old English, a phenomenon that modern translation studies have shown can lead to translation errors.[CITATION-175] Such \u2018translationese\u2019 appears both in laws with identifiable Latin models and where those same passages deviate from their models. That suggests that the author was not simply translating sources from Latin simultaneously with composing laws in Old English. This is, for instance, indicated by the first ordeal law, whereis found in the part where the author departed from the suggested Latin source. It seems that this phrase could not have ended up inunless we propose that the seventh-century author borrowed parts of the law from the, composed his own adjusted version in Latin, and then translated it into Old English himself, all the while retaining an unidiomatic expression. Trying to maintain a seventh-century date for the Old English involves many such contortions, and each different example of a Latinism requires us to bend in a different direction. In addition, more rationalising is then required to explain why the Old English of the extant version ofdates to the ninth century and not the seventh. Ultimately, the simplest solution might be that all ofor a majority of its sections were written in Latin in the seventh century and translated in the ninth.The details of the translation I am proposing are elusive, but the mere existence of an Anglo-Latin law-code in the seventh century has many implications.[CITATION-176] Firstly, it could add a new dimension to the long-running debate about the role and significance of written law in the early Middle Ages. As I suggested above, it could support Wormald\u2019s argument that lawmakers were deliberately attempting to evoke Roman, biblical and/or Frankish models.[CITATION-177] Perhaps Ine mimicked the Romans not just in committing law to writing\u2014as had \u00c6thelberht of Kent\u2014but also in composing that law in Latin.[CITATION-178] The result of such mimicry would have been to make early Wessex look more similar to its Frankish counterparts, perhaps suggesting that Ine attempted to stake a claim for a place among the big political players in England and on the continent.Alternatively, the existence of an Anglo-Latin law-code could suggest that Latin simply was the main written language of legal and administrative affairs in Wessex at the time. All other surviving legal documents from this period, namely royal diplomas (including over a dozen surviving in Ine\u2019s name), were written in Latin. The dominance of Latin in this sphere could originally have been caused by linguistic practicalities\u2014perhaps connected to the Frankish contingent in the higher clergy\u2014or it may be that Latin was simply part of the package when written legal genres were imported.[CITATION-179] The use of Latin could represent a mixture of such ideological and quotidian motivations or something else completely. In any case, the potential Latin origins of Ine\u2019s laws and their seeming use of Frankish material compels us to rethink how early Anglo-Saxon kings sought to position themselves within a wider cross-Channel political context and to consider the significance of yet another close connection between England and the continent in the sphere of administration, law and rulership.[CITATION-180] The Latin theory also calls into question how Ine\u2019s laws should be used as evidence for early Wessex. The surviving text of these laws contains the earliest attestations of words associated with the English administrative system, such as(\u2018shire\u2019) and(\u2018ealdorman\u2019), and they offer evidence for the early English history of slavery, taxation, the ordeal, guilds, labour service, money and much more.[CITATION-181] The difficulty is that many of the Old English words and phrases we rely on to assess such social and legal structures can only be taken as ninth-century attestations, and consequently, it is uncertain precisely what kinds of systems Ine\u2019s laws are describing. For instance, while the shire () came to be a distinct administrative unit in later centuries,\u2019sandcould be translations of words such asand.[CITATION-182] It is impossible to know whether such terms would have been used generically or with a specific administrative unit as their referent.[CITATION-183] In either case, I would suggest that the original words and their referents are hidden from view.Similar concerns apply more generally when attempting to useto investigate wider political developments and ideas. The primary evidence in this regard are the laws that mention\u2018a Briton\u2019 (also \u2018Foreign, slave\u2019), some of which also distinguish betweenand.[CITATION-184] These clauses have the potential to shed light on intriguing but obscure areas, such as the relationship between \u2018English\u2019 West Saxons and British subjects who came under West Saxon control during the seventh century, or, alternatively, on the relationship between \u2018English\u2019 West Saxons and potential remnants of the Romano-British population in Wessex.[CITATION-185] These terms have been taken to have bearing on ideas of nationality too: it has been suggested that Ine\u2019s laws positioned people as West Saxonthe king and other Germanic peoples, but as EnglishBritish neighbours.[CITATION-186] This may well be the case, but the theory thatwas only translated into Old English in the ninth century introduces cracks into the linguistic foundations of such claims, given that we cannot be certain of what words were used in the original text. What is more, such concepts must also be considered from an Alfredian and a continental perspective. For instance, the apparent emergence of an imagined community of \u2018the English\u2019 during Alfred\u2019s reign means that the use of the wordsandinmust be considered also in light of ninth-century notions of nationality.[CITATION-187] The fact that parallel categories to \u2018British\u2019 and \u2018English\u2019, namelyand, are found in, for instance, themeans that there is at least some chance that the presence of such an ethnic division in legislation was partly an import.[CITATION-188] It is in the nature of research on the early Middle Ages that small pieces of evidence come to matter a great deal. As we have seen, Ine\u2019s code is an irresistibly rich source for some of the murkier parts of the seventh-century world, including family life, animals and farming, food, money, social status, outsiders, criminal offences and so on. Consequently, Ine\u2019s laws are used widely and by scholars of many areas, most of whom are, no doubt, well aware of the dangers involved. However, we need to be even more diligent when relying on specific words or concepts: words should be considered against potential Latin models and concepts must be interpreted not just in the context of seventh-century Wessex but also in the context of ninth-century Wessex and seventh-century continental law. Such warnings stand regardless of one\u2019s thoughts ons original language, given its textual transmission and the undeniable oddities of its phrasings. But while the Latin hypothesis I have presented here may cast doubt on how we read some of our evidence, it also offers fresh and tantalising glimpses of seventh-century law and kingship.1.

        "14": "In terms of comparison between Ine and the Kentish laws, there are (expected) similarities in the basic vocabulary which is frequently used; the only significant similarity is huslgenga \u2018communicant\u2019, which only ever appears in Wi 23 and Ine 15.1 and 19. However, given that this word has to do with the Eucharist, it is likely that its use was prompted by a Latin term in both texts. The relatively rare word byrga \u2018surety, guardian\u2019 appears in both Ine and Hlothhere and Eadric\u2019s laws, but it also appears in Alfred\u2019s laws and a number of glosses and translations. Ine and Wihtr\u00e6d include similar rules on Sunday work (Ine 3\u20133.2/Wi 9\u201310) and thieves (Ine 12/Wi 21), but there are no similarities in phrasing and vocabulary. However, the final clause of Wihtr\u00e6d is a near verbatim version of a clause in Ine. Ine 20 reads: \u2018Gif feorcund mon o\u00f0\u00f0e fremde butan wege geond wudu gonge 7 ne hrieme ne horn blawe, for \u00f0eof he bi\u00f0 to profianne o\u00f0\u00f0e to sleanne o\u00f0\u00f0e to aliesanne\u2019 (\u2018If a foreigner or stranger walks through the woods off the path and does not shout or blow a horn, he is to be regarded as a thief, either to be slain or to be cleared\u2019). And Wi 28: \u2018Gif feorran cumen man o\u00fe\u00fee fremde buton wege gange 7 he \u00feonne naw\u00f0er ne hryme ne he norn ne blawe, for \u00f0eof he bi\u00f0 to profianne, o\u00fe\u00fee to sleanne o\u00fe\u00fee to alysenne\u2019 (\u2018If a foreigner or stranger walks off the path and he then does not shout nor blow a horn, he is to be regarded as a thief, either to be slain or to be cleared\u2019). Liebermann saw this as a direct borrowing from Ine into Wihtr\u00e6d (Liebermann, Gesetze III, p. 30), though it has also been suggested that the two laws used a common source, as the idea contained in the law is \u2018quasi-universal\u2019: Oliver, Beginnings, pp. 166, 179\u201380; S. Jurasinski, \u2018Royal Law in Wessex and Kent at the Close of the Seventh Century\u2019, in S. Jurasinski and A. Rabin, eds, Languages of the Law in Early Medieval England: Essays in Memory of Lisi Oliver (Groningen, 2019), pp. 25\u201344, at 32\u20134. Indeed, the shared source solution could be plausible, given that Wihtr\u00e6d\u2019s laws are Latinate throughout: its preface reads like a word-for-word rendering of church council decrees such as the Latin text of the council of H\u00e6thfeld in 679 and it is unique in citing a Latin oath, perhaps taken from the Collectio Canonum Hibernensis; see I. Ivarsen, \u2018A Vernacular Genre? Latin and the Early English Laws\u2019, Journal of Medieval History, xlvii (2021), pp. 497\u2013508, at 500\u2013501. Furthermore, Wihtr\u00e6d\u2019s content is influenced by a number of Latin ecclesiastical sources; see C. Cubitt, \u2018Bishops and Councils in Late Saxon England: The Intersection of Secular and Ecclesiastical Law\u2019, in W. Hartmann, ed., Recht und Gericht in Kirche und Welt (Munich, 2007), pp. 151\u201364, at 155\u20136; Liebermann, Gesetze III, p. 24; Oliver, Beginnings, e.g. pp. 165\u20136. Indeed, the Latinate language and ecclesiastical content of Wihtr\u00e6d led Wormald to suggest that the whole text might be a translation of a church council decree (MEL, p. 102). In fact, there is some linguistic indication that there is a Latin text underlying Ine and Wihtr\u00e6d\u2019s wording. The unusual pairing feorcund mon (feorran cumen) and fremde is reminiscent of the Latin collocation advena et peregrinus, which appears a few places in the Bible, frequently in patristic commentary, in at least one church canon (in Collectio Turonensis) and in the (eighth-century) Lex Baiwariorum (\u00a7\u00a731\u20132, ed. E. Schwind, Monumenta Germaniae Historica [hereafter MGH], Leges nationum Germanicarum [hereafter LL nat. Germ.], V, 2 [Hanover, 1926], pp. 336\u20137). None of the scriptural occurrences have much in common with Ine and Wihtr\u00e6d legally, though the occurrence in Lex Baiwariorum exhibits some parallels: it concerns the opposite of the Anglo-Saxon law, in that it seeks to ensure the peace and safety of peregrini (pilgrims) travelling on the road, and cites a version of Exodus 22:21 (which uses peregrinus and advena) to back it up. Lex Baiwariorum is later than both Ine and Withr\u00e6d\u2019s laws, though might still carry some indication of the use of this phrase earlier. Lex Salica might also offer some linguistic parallel in a law that reads \u2018Si quis per messem alienam ambulauerit sine uia aut semita uias fecerit, sol. XV cul. iud.\u2019 (Lex Salica, \u00a754, ed. K.A. Eckhardt, MGH LL nat. Germ., IV, 2 [Hanover, 1969]), given that \u2018ambulare sine via\u2019 is an exact equivalent to \u2018buton wege gangan\u2019. Though again, the meaning of the law is different. I have been unable to find an exact parallel in existing sources; in the end, there are a number of possibilities for how this law ended up in both Ine and Wihtr\u00e6d. As I will argue in this article, the cumulative case for Ine\u2019s Latin origins is strong enough to suggest that the Wihtr\u00e6d parallel must be fitted into this framework rather than vice versa (and we ought to bear in mind that while the two clauses are strikingly similar, they are not identical). A strong possibility is that this law was part of an originally Old English section of Ine; as we shall see below (n. 22), Wormald suggested that the text which Alfred transmitted as Ine\u2019s laws consists of a core and sections which accrued later on in Ine\u2019s reign or after. Perhaps the section containing Ine 20 was originally in Old English. Other alternatives include that Ine and Wihtr\u00e6d shared a Latin source and that the ninth-century translator had a copy of Wihtr\u00e6d he used when translating Ine; or that the clause in Wihtr\u00e6d, being the final clause of his laws, made its way into the text at some other point between its composition in the seventh century and its surviving form from the twelfth century. The conspicuously different wording on other topics shared by Ine and Wihtr\u00e6d (e.g. Ine 3, 3.2/Wi 8\u20139) offers some indication that the drafters of Wihtr\u00e6d were not using the existing Old English text of Ine directly.",

Another homily, Napier 44 (no. 38), uses the phrase in the same context in which it appears in Exodus, occurring in direct speech from God. This homily is very close to Napier 43, and both use a fairly unusual present participle construction for the swelte phrase. In Napier 43 the phrase translates Exodus 35:2 (\u2018occidetur\u2019) (Wulfstan: Sammlung der ihm zugeschriebenen Homilien nebst untersuchungen \u00fcber ihre echtheit, ed.

Regardless, the context in which the phrase is used in these sources is entirely similar to the rest of the works\u2014either biblical (Napier 44, Vercelli 8) or as punishment for not believing in God (Exaltation).

L. Bieler also seems to agree with such a date in The Irish Penitentials (Dublin, 1963), p. 7.

        "86": "The Excerpta exists in three English manuscripts: British Library, Cotton MS Otho E. XIII; Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Hatton 42; and Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 265. Otho and Hatton were probably written in Brittany in the ninth century, arriving in England in the tenth (see Gneuss and Lapidge, Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts, nos 361 and 629, and F.A. Rella, \u2018Continental Manuscripts Acquired for English Centers in the Tenth and Early Eleventh Centuries: A Preliminary Checklist\u2019, Anglia, xcviii [1980], pp. 105\u201316), and so they are not copies of an older English tradition of the Excerpta. Dumville proposed that the text in CCCC 265 was copied from a tenth-century Breton import too (Dumville, \u2018On the Dating of the Early Breton Lawcodes\u2019, p. 208 n. 9). However, it still cannot be ruled out that the Excerpta (or a similar text or the source on which it was based) existed in England at the time. Michael Elliot has identified a hand (perhaps tenth-century) making corrections to the Excerpta in Hatton 42, arguing that the nature of the changes suggest that the scribe was comparing the text against a different version (see \u2018Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 42\u2019, Anglo-Saxon Canon Law, available at http://individual.utoronto.ca/michaelelliot/manuscripts.html). I do not know whether the proposed comparison was made against one of the known English copies of the Excerpta or if this could be an indication of another English version once in existence. Sixteen clauses from the Excerpta are included near verbatim in a Welsh law-code in Latin extant in a thirteenth-century manuscript (Bieler, \u2018Towards an Interpretation\u2019, p. 388), though it is possible that these clauses only made their way into the Welsh tradition after the eleventh century (as proposed in Dumville, \u2018On the Dating of the Early Breton Lawcodes\u2019, p. 208). However, Stefan Jurasinski has noted similarities between the Excerpta and the laws of \u00c6thelberht, which he proposed could be due to direct influence (or alternatively the result of shared legal principles): S. Jurasinski, \u2018Germanism, Slapping, and the Cultural Contexts of \u00c6thelberht\u2019s Code: A Reconsideration of Chapters 56\u201358\u2019, Haskins Society Journal, xviii (2006), pp. 51\u201371, at 67\u20139. I would add that Excerpta chapters A11/P 9 (printed in Bieler, Irish Penitentials, pp. 138\u20139, 150\u201351) might be a potential source for the ill-understood laws on headwounds in \u00c6thelberht and Alfred\u2019s laws (which are printed and discussed in L. Oliver, \u2018\u00c6thelberht\u2019s and Alfred\u2019s Two Skulls\u2019, Heroic Age, xiv [2010], available at https://www.heroicage.org/issues/14/oliver.php).

Perhaps the underlying Latin word was latro, which can mean \u2018thief\u2019 but also \u2018robber, bandit, plunderer\u2019, and this second sense would suit the context in Ine better, given that the other two categories are \u2018band, gang\u2019 and \u2018army\u2019.",

Mynster \u2018minster\u2019 is a debated term. It derives from monasterium, but seems to encompass more than the translation \u2018monastery\u2019 would imply, as it could also be inhabited by clergy and played a role in pastoral care; see S.

The laws on moving districts and changing lords (Ine 39/Af 37) might provide another example. Here, Ine uses the word scir \u2018shire\u2019 and Alfred boldget\u00e6l \u2018district\u2019. Alfred\u2019s boldget\u00e6l could be a Mercian word, since it is only otherwise attested in the ninth-century translation of Gregory the Great\u2019s Dialogi, rendering prouincia. This translation was done by the Mercian bishop W\u00e6rferth, who was part of Alfred\u2019s circle of scholars. As Wormald noted, the presence of this word in Alfred\u2019s laws has in the past been taken as possible evidence of the underlying lost laws of King Offa of Mercia, though, as Wormald points out, the law in question is much more likely to be based on Ine\u2019s: P. Wormald, \u2018In Search of King Offa\u2019s \u201cLaw-Code\u2019\u2019\u2019, in his Legal Culture in the Early Medieval West, pp. 201\u201324, at 203\u20134. Wormald explained the discrepancy in word choice by proposing that scir \u2018shire\u2019 in Ine\u2019s day would not have referred to the same administrative unit as in Alfred\u2019s day, and that Alfred therefore had to look for another word to render Ine\u2019s law: MEL II, pp. 192\u20133. However, another solution, in the light of the argument made here, is that Alfred based his law on a Latin version of Ine\u2014which may have had prouincia or something else\u2014and that the translator of the clauses for Alfred\u2019s portion chose boldget\u00e6l and the translator of the whole Ine text chose scir. It would also account for the anachronism that David Dumville identified in Ine\u2019s use of scir (in an unpublished paper, cited in Dammery, \u2018Law-Code\u2019, p. 267, n. 121).

Seld. B. 14) copied out by William of Malmesbury in the twelfth century; see Cook, \u2018Aldhelm\u2019s Legal Studies\u2019, p. 111; M.R. James, Two Ancient English Scholars: St. Aldhelm and William of Malmesbury (Glasgow, 1931), p. 14; G. Dempsey, \u2018Legal Terminology in Anglo-Saxon England: The Trimoda Necessitas Charter\u2019, Speculum, lvii (1982), pp. 843\u20139, at 847\u20138. Indeed, Wallace-Hadrill suggested that the study of such a text at Canterbury in the seventh century may partly explain why the laws of Ine (as well as Wihtr\u00e6d) are so much more sophisticated than \u2018the disjointed tariffs of offences that passed for law with Aethelberht\u2019; J.M. Wallace-Hadrill, Early Medieval History (New York, 1976), pp. 127\u20138.",
        "172": "I call Ine ambitious with reference to the territorial expansion and consolidation of previous expansion in his reign, though nothing is known about the king\u2019s own aspirations. For details of the conquests and battles fought by Ine, see Yorke, Wessex, pp. 52\u201362, and Kirby, Earliest English Kings, pp. 48\u201360, 118\u201328. Patrick Wormald saw Ine as the \u2018de facto founder of the political order that prevailed in Wessex for the next century\u2019 (\u2018Ine\u2019, ODNB), and it seems that previous West-Saxon (or Gewissan) sub-kingships disappeared with Ine\u2019s kingship (B. Yorke, \u2018Wessex\u2019, in Lapidge et al., eds, Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia, p. 491). Perhaps Ine\u2019s decision to abdicate and travel on pilgrimage to Rome also suggests some sense of political grandiosity; see C. Stancliffe, \u2018Kings who Opted Out\u2019, in P. Wormald, ed., Ideal and Reality in Frankish and Anglo-Saxon Society (Oxford, 1983), pp. 154\u201376.",

Orchard, \u2018Aldhelm\u2019s Library\u2019, in Gameson, ed., Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, I, pp. 591\u2013605.",
        "174": "If we were to suppose that Ine was written in Old English in the seventh century, its writer must either have been a native speaker or someone very competent in Old English, given the length and complexity of the text.

        "176": "One implication that I do not deal with here is what it means for our view of the ninth century, the Alfredian translation project and Alfred\u2019s ideas of the appropriate languages of the law; for some discussion of this, see Ivarsen, \u2018Production of the Anglo-Saxon Laws\u2019, pp. 115\u201317, and \u2018A Vernacular Genre?\u2019.",
        "177": "The \u2018lex scripta\u2019 debate is primarily associated with Wormald, whose two most important articles in this area are \u2018Lex Scripta and Verbum Regis\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Inter cetera\u2019\u2019, which are supplemented by Chapter 2 of MEL (pp. 29\u2013110).",
        "178": "Bede noted that \u00c6thelberht decreed \u2018iuxta exempla Romanorum\u2019, but that his laws were composed Anglorum sermone: Bede, Historia ecclesiastica, ii. 5, ed. Colgrave and Mynors, p. 150. Wormald and others have interpreted this to mean that \u00c6thelberht was following the example of the Romans in committing law to writing rather than it signalling any Roman legal influence; see Wormald, \u2018\u2018Inter cetera\u2019\u2019, pp. 181\u20132, and MEL, p. 29.",
        "179": "There is an extensive historiography on the origins of the form and language of Anglo-Saxon charters, though there is some consensus that they were derived from the form of Roman private deeds; see Gallagher, \u2018Vernacular in Anglo-Saxon Charters\u2019, p. 208 and see also Gallagher, \u2018Asser and the Writing of Charters\u2019.",
        "180": "It is also possible that the use of Latin in law and administration could be seen in the context of British or Irish connections or even as vestiges of Romano-British practices; for the argument that Latin would have been the primary language in lowland Britain when the Anglo-Saxons arrived, see P. Schrijver, \u2018What Britons Spoke around 400 AD\u2019, in N. Higham, ed., Britons in Anglo-Saxon England (Woodbridge, 2012), pp. 165\u201371. However, the continental parallels in content and wording make Frankish influence a more plausible scenario, though the possible use of the Excerpta de libris Romanorum et Francorum (which was discussed above, n. 83) could perhaps suggest a connection to Brittany.",

For the possibility that scir was a translation of prouincia, see above, n. 154.

As he points out, the so-called Malberg glosses of the Lex Salica give walas for Romani, offering yet another link. It is also tempting in this regard to connect the potential use in Ine of the Breton law-text Excerpta de libris Romanorum et Francorum (for references, see the above discussion of swelte he dea\u00f0e), the title of which is present in four of five manuscripts of one recension (Bieler, \u2018Towards an Interpretation\u2019, p. 389)."
