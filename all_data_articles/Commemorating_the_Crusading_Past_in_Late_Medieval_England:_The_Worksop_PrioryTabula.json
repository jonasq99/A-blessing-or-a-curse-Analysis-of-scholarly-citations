    "article": "Memory has featured prominently in recent scholarship on the crusades. In particular, the remembrance of crusaders by their descendants and associated ecclesiastical institutions in the high Middle Ages has attracted considerable attention; however, few studies have concentrated on the commemoration of crusaders in the later Middle Ages. This article examines a late fifteenth-century genealogical poem, which was produced for public display on a tablet at Worksop Priory (Nottinghamshire) and contains unique information about members of the Furnival family on the Barons\u2019 Crusade (1239\u201341), in order to explore how and why medieval institutions preserved memories of crusaders into the late Middle Ages. It argues that, although inaccurate in its crusade narrative, the poem provides invaluable insights into the mechanisms of aristocratic family memory in medieval England; and it focuses on the important role of material prompts in the process of commemoration. Specifically, it suggests that an effigy of Sir Thomas de Furnival was erected at Worksop soon after his death away from home in 1241. In the absence of a written record, this cenotaph acted as a prompt to an oral narrative tradition which informed the Worksop poet when he came to compose his genealogical work. This study is, therefore, an analysis of crusade memory, but it is also an examination of the presentation of a crusade narrative to a public audience, an opportunity to unravel the confused history of three crusading brothers, and an attempt to understand the response of a medieval community that had suffered losses in overseas ventures.The() is a rhyme royal poem that was written in the late fifteenth century.[CITATION-1] In content, it is a genealogical history of the patrons of Worksop Priory\u2014a house of Augustinian canons situated in north Nottinghamshire\u2014covering the period from the institution\u2019s establishment during the early twelfth century until the time of the poem\u2019s composition. Over the course of twenty-nine Middle English stanzas, which are interrupted at irregular intervals by interjections of Latin text, the author of the poem, who names himself as Pigott, leads his readers around the priory\u2019s tomb monuments. Throughout, Pigott includes brief biographical details about the towering figures from the families of Lovetot, Furnival, Neville and Talbot who were the institution\u2019s primary patrons during its 400-year history.As a work of literature, theis often considered a poor example of its genre. In the 1819 edition of the Lansdowne manuscripts catalogue, it was derided as \u2018a wretched poem, written in seven-line stanzas \u2026 by one Pigott, probably a monk of the abbey\u2019,[CITATION-2] and the nineteenth-century historian John Holland described the work as \u2018rather long, and, from the nature of the subject, very dull\u2019.[CITATION-3] Almost a century later, Gordon Hall Gerould would remark that its author \u2018was by no means an accomplished poet\u2019,[CITATION-4] and the\u2019s most recent critic, Chris Given-Wilson, has observed that it was \u2018haplessly\u2019 composed.[CITATION-5] Few have been set alight, it would seem, by the artistic merit of this poem, but it is important for what it reveals about the institution\u2019s history. While Worksop\u2019s fourteenth-century gatehouse and Romanesque church still stand,[CITATION-6] three badly damaged alabaster effigies are the only evidence, other than the poem, that the priory housed the remains of many of its aristocratic patrons throughout the Middle Ages.[CITATION-7] Thealso goes some way to mitigating the loss of Worksop\u2019s cartulary, which went up in flames in 1761.[CITATION-8] Like many genealogical works of the time, the author of thesituated his account in a framework of events and movements that were prominent features of the landscape of historical consciousness in late medieval England.[CITATION-9] Over the course of its considerable chronological scope, this genealogical poem intertwines the lives of the Talbots\u2019 ancestors with the Norman Conquest, the Hundred Years War, the English dynastic wars of the fifteenth century, and the crusades. As research on historical consciousness in recent times has revealed, the remembrance of such events, moments and movements is integral to the functioning of collective memory and, therefore, communal identity.[CITATION-10] Much could be said about Pigott\u2019s use of all the above-mentioned medieval signposts in his attempt to build strong ties with Worksop\u2019s Talbot patrons through his telling of this family history. Unsurprisingly, William the Conqueror and the Conquest appear in two stanzas of the;[CITATION-11] as Elisabeth van Houts has demonstrated, 1066 quickly became entrenched in the historical consciousness of the Anglo-Norman, and then Angevin, realm.[CITATION-12] If there is a hero of the Worksop poem, though, it is John Talbot I, grandfather of the then lord of Worksop and \u2018most drede of all other with Frenchmen\u2019, who died while leading a characteristically reckless offensive operation, charging the cannon at the Battle of Castillon in Gascony in July 1453, in the final years of the Hundred Years War: five stanzas are devoted to John I\u2019s martial virtues, chivalry and accomplishments.[CITATION-13] Theis also of interest for the unique information it contains about the crusading experiences of the Furnivals, a kin group who occupied positions in the households of kings from the twelfth century and maintained high office into the late Middle Ages.[CITATION-14] It is the preservation and presentation of the Furnival crusading history as recorded in thethat forms the focus of the current investigation.The means by which crusades were remembered in medieval Europe has been a prominent aspect of recent crusade scholarship.[CITATION-15] The mechanisms of family memory, especially, have been subjected to important enquiries.[CITATION-16] So far, however, studies have tended to concentrate on the earlier period of crusading; and while the era of the later crusades is now better understood, thanks to the work of pioneering historians such as Norman Housley,[CITATION-17] the commemoration of crusading in the later Middle Ages has received only limited attention.[CITATION-18] As texts such as thedemonstrate, though, there is good reason and rich material for examining how and why crusades were remembered in this later period.Two of the poem\u2019s stanzas briefly narrate the participation of two Furnival brothers\u2014Thomas and Gerard, sons of another Gerard\u2014in a crusading venture to the Holy Land,[CITATION-19] reporting that Thomas perished as a martyr while there:Which Gerard gate Thomas; and Gerard ekeGood S. William cleped also in dede:Which Thomas to the Holy Lande went for to seekeThe sepulture of Christe, and therto agreedWith Gerard his brother, and there Thomas dyedSlayne of the Sarazens for Christes love,Therefore we trist Christ hath reward him above.[CITATION-20] Thegoes on to report that Gerard then returned home, but in doing so incurred the wrath of his grieving mother, Matilda de Lovetot (here named Maud). She was so distraught at the thought of her son buried in a Holy Land possessed by \u2018hathen\u2019 that Gerard was ordered back to recover the bones of his brother, and he dutifully set out on a second journey to repatriate the remains. According to the poem, Gerard was successful:When Sr. Thomas was slayne for Christes sakeHis broder came home Gerard agayne,And that Molde ther moder grevously gan takeThat his bones emong hathen shuld be lane,And made him retorne without more disdeyneAgaine to the Holy Lande, and his bones home brought,As it was Goddes will; that him dere boght.[CITATION-21] The subsequent stanza describes Thomas\u2019s tomb, which lay under an elaborate knightly effigy bejewelled with precious stones on the north side of Worksop Priory:Then tumulate here in Notinghamshire,At Wyrksoppe, the north syde of this mynster,With his helm on his hede will enquereWith precious stones sometyme, that were sett sere,And a noble charbuncle on him doth he bere.On his hede to see they may who so willOf my writing witness for to fulfill.[CITATION-22] Following on immediately from the description of Thomas\u2019s resting place, the reader is directed to the tomb of Gerard, who lay on the south side of the church under a marble stone, and that of \u2018Sr. William ther brother both flesh and bone\u2019, who, we are told, was buried in the Lady Chapel.What we have here is a description of Furnival involvement in the Barons\u2019 Crusade (1239\u201341) and the subsequent burials of the brothers at Worksop Priory.[CITATION-23] However, this unique account, which has informed many who have turned their attention to Furnival history ever since, is a deeply problematic narrative.[CITATION-24] A reading of Matthew Paris\u2019s, completed in the 1250s, tells us that Thomas I and Gerard de Furnival III were indeed present on this endeavour, and joined by their brother William, but a different version of events to the one contained in theemerges.[CITATION-25] Although Paris says nothing of Thomas\u2019s fate, he lists Gerard among several English nobles who perished in the east in 1241. It is of course possible that Pigott, who was writing more than two hundred years later and was seemingly unaware of these aspects of Matthew Paris\u2019s chronicle, simply confused the names of the two brothers, but scrutiny of complementary thirteenth-century evidence indicates that this discrepancy is more than a case of a misinformed writer. Indeed, when Matthew Paris\u2019s chronicle is examined alongside Court and Exchequer records, it appears that both Thomas and Gerard died on crusade. If the earlier evidence is to be favoured, then the account of Gerard\u2019s return to the Holy Land to recover his brother\u2019s remains is a fiction. The dissonance between the thirteenth-century sources and the fifteenth-centuryrequires further explanation.In order to examine both the development of the Furnival crusading history and its presentation to a late medieval audience, this study is set out in two distinct sections. First, an analysis of a variety of thirteenth-century records and chronicles sheds light on the fate of the three crusading brothers. A second section then explores the development of the crusade narrative over two centuries, examining the\u2019s function, audience, sources and influences. It is argued that the seeds of the unusual story found in the poem were planted shortly after Thomas\u2019s death when members of his family, most likely led by his mother, Matilda de Lovetot, constructed an elaborate effigy to commemorate the lost crusader and preserve his.[CITATION-26] This effigy acted as a material prompt for an orally transmitted narrative that mutated once it stretched beyond living memory. When writing about the crusades in his fifteenth-century poem, Pigott was reliant on this inaccurate narrative tradition, but in any case he was not so much concerned with precision as he was remembrance.It must be acknowledged that an argument for the existence of a centuries-long oral tradition made on the basis of three stanzas in a late medieval poem will be difficult for some to accept. As will be demonstrated, however, Pigott acknowledged that he had relied on chronicles at times, and he quoted from church inscriptions on occasion. Moreover, there is evidence of an earlier genealogical work produced in Latin at Worksop, and he appears also to have drawn on this. The absence of any reference to a written text in the crusade verses of his poem, when taken in the wider context of Pigott\u2019s treatment of sources, thus appears indicative of a process of oral transmission.This study is, therefore, an analysis of crusade memory: the Furnivals provide an opportunity to push the methodological approaches deployed by recent scholarship on the topic of crusade memory in the high Middle Ages into a later period. It is also an examination of the presentation of a crusade narrative to a wide audience, an attempt to understand the response of a medieval community that had suffered losses in overseas ventures, and, in the first section of this article, an opportunity to unravel the confused history of three crusading brothers.By the time that Pope Gregory IX called Christendom to crusade through his encyclicalin 1234,[CITATION-27] the Furnivals\u2014a family connected to the households of Philip II Augustus of France, and Richard I and John of England\u2014had established a notable, albeit relatively recent, tradition of service in the east.[CITATION-28] Gerard de Furnival I had risen to prominence during the Third Crusade,[CITATION-29] and he set out east again in 1204,[CITATION-30] where it is likely that he ended his days sometime after March 1205.[CITATION-31] Then, following his father\u2019s example, and perhaps motivated by both penance and political expediency after the civil strife of King John\u2019s reign in England, Gerard II took the cross for the Fifth Crusade and perished at Damietta in Egypt in 1219.[CITATION-32] Both the grandfather and father of Thomas, William and Gerard III had, then, died in the east, and while Pope Gregory did not make a direct appeal to familial crusading traditions in his encyclical, the presence of three Furnival brothers on the Barons\u2019 Crusade suggests that heritage remained an emotive issue for potentialin the 1230s. It is unnecessary to explore the expedition in detail here, as the background, preaching, recruitment and course of the crusade are dealt with elsewhere, but certain issues are pertinent.[CITATION-33] The call to arms was well received in England. According to Matthew Paris, the Furnivals were among a \u2018countless number\u2019 who took the cross eagerly.[CITATION-34] However, owing to a ten-year truce in the Holy Land, which was not scheduled to expire until 1239, many crusaders had a long time to wait before making good on their vows. In addition to the considerable delay, the difficulties involved in planning a crusade were compounded by Pope Gregory\u2019s own inconsistencies regarding the target of the expedition. The pontiff\u2019s attention was divided between the venture to Jerusalem and another that was running concurrently in aid of the Latin empire of Constantinople, which had come into being following the Fourth Crusade.[CITATION-35] By the end of 1239, though, a sizeable army of crusaders under the direction of King Theobald of Navarre (also count of Champagne) was on its way to the Holy Land. Meanwhile, in England, despite repeated attempts by the papacy to persuade several magnates to make the expedition to Latin Greece rather than travelling to Jerusalem, and a cooling of crusading fervour among some, considerable numbers made final preparations for departure.When it came time to set out, the Furnival brothers did not travel together in a single contingent. According to Matthew Paris, William joined Earl Richard of Cornwall, while Thomas and Gerard followed Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, through the Italian port of Brindisi.[CITATION-36] The reason for William de Furnival\u2019s separation from his brothers is uncertain and does not impact on the current investigation, but the matter is explored elsewhere.[CITATION-37] A third contingent from England led by William de Forz set out in 1241.Richard of Cornwall\u2019s venture departed England on 10 June 1240 and travelled south through France to Marseille. After arriving in the Levant during October, Richard\u2019s expedition was primarily one of peaceful negotiation. While in the Holy Land, he achieved the considerable feats of rebuilding the ruined fortress of Ascalon and negotiating the return of the remains of many Christian dead, but by the end of May 1241 he had set sail for Europe. It is likely, then, that William de Furnival was not involved in combat during his time in the east and that he was back home by the summer of 1241.The itinerary of Simon de Montfort\u2019s contingent, which included Thomas and Gerard de Furnival (and we are again reliant on Matthew Paris for this information), remains elusive.[CITATION-38] As Peter Jackson has noted, the study of the Barons\u2019 Crusade is severely hindered by a paucity of surviving source materials,[CITATION-39] and this is especially so for the events of Simon\u2019s expedition. In fact, his actions are almost entirely unknown after he set sail from Brindisi in October 1240,[CITATION-40] although a single letter written in the spring of 1241 suggests that he spent time in Acre alongside family members such as Philip de Montfort, lord of Toron.[CITATION-41] He was back in Western Europe, although not England, by the end of the same year.[CITATION-42] Most pertinently to this investigation, it seems he returned without either Gerard or Thomas de Furnival.Matthew Paris recorded Gerard III\u2019s death under the year 1241 in both hisand, the latter finished only nine years after Gerard\u2019s passing.[CITATION-43] While it would be rash to discount the possibility of a mistake on Matthew\u2019s part, a variety of records support his claim. On 9 January 1242, Christiana Ledet, Gerard\u2019s wife, was described as his widow when she was granted custody of his land at Munden in Hertfordshire and its appurtenances, as well as of Gerard\u2019s heirs, for 250 marks.[CITATION-44] In the same year, Christiana was mentioned in the Curia Regis Roll, where it was reported that she was no longer married (\u2018que fuit uxor Gerardi de Furnival\u2019), and a year later she was acting on behalf of her son, who was referred to as \u2018Gerard, the son and heir of Gerard de Furnival\u2019.[CITATION-45] Furthermore, the Fine Rolls of 1243 record that Gerard, son of Gerard de Furnival, paid the king 20for a writ of(rights of seisin on the death of a relative), and the issue, which concerned two carucates of land with appurtenances in Swanland, Braffords, and North Ferriby against the prior of Old Malton, was considered again in December of the same year.[CITATION-46] When this varied evidence is read in the light of Matthew Paris\u2019s crusader obituary list for 1241, we can be in no doubt that Gerard III perished on the Barons\u2019 Crusade. This alone demonstrates that Pigott\u2019s late fifteenth-century account of the crusading Furnivals is inaccurate\u2014Gerard simply cannot have returned to the Holy Land to retrieve his brother\u2019s remains.It must be acknowledged that Thomas de Furnival\u2019s fate is even more difficult to establish with certainty by reference to contemporary chronicle evidence alone. Matthew Paris does not include him among his list of English nobles killed in the Holy Land. In fact, the earliest surviving document to report on the circumstances of Thomas\u2019s death explicitly is the. As we have already seen, this is not a trustworthy source, but much circumstantial evidence suggests that Pigott was correct to believe that Thomas died while on crusade. Turning again to Exchequer records, the entry for Nottingham and Derby in the Memoranda Roll of 1243\u201344 is particularly telling. It refers to the \u2018heir of Thomas de Furnival\u2019 when discussing revenues in the Peak (Derbyshire),[CITATION-47] and it should be noted that Simon de Montfort, who had led Thomas\u2019s contingent, arrived back in England for the first time after the crusade in the autumn of 1243.[CITATION-48] He may have confirmed reports of Thomas\u2019s death at this time. Moreover, the 1245 record of the Court of the King\u2019s Bench for Buckinghamshire mentions \u2018Gerard, son and heir of Thomas de Furnival\u2019 in a disagreement between two men regarding rights to land through military service.[CITATION-49] References to an heir do not entirely discount the possibility of Thomas\u2019s survival, but his disappearance from the historical record after December 1239, when he pledged 40 marks for a fine alongside his fellow crusaders William Longesp\u00e9e, Hugh Wake and Hamo Peche, is highly suggestive of his demise\u2014especially when we consider the wider context of his career, which includes some quite detailed evidence for his rise to prominence in the late 1230s followed by silence on his actions thereafter.[CITATION-50] Indeed, in the three years before his departure on crusade in 1240, Thomas had been an active participant in England\u2019s political scene. He is listed as a witness to the 1237 Treaty of York, which confirmed rights over territories between the kings of England and Scotland. This is also the only evidence of a prior connection between Thomas and Simon de Montfort, as the latter also appeared as a named witness. Thomas was, then, beginning to make his mark in kingdom-wide affairs by 1237.[CITATION-51] A year later, in 1238, King Henry III gave his assent to the marriage of Thomas\u2019s eldest daughter to Roger de Mowbray II, heir to one of the great Yorkshire baronies.[CITATION-52] Furthermore, the Liberate Rolls reveal that in 1239 Thomas was provided with 40 marks for guardianship of the castle of the Peak between 8 February and 11 June.[CITATION-53] This rise in prominence during the late 1230s contrasts starkly with the post-1241 period. Throughout the 1240s, Thomas\u2019s name is absent from the Patent Rolls, Liberate Rolls and Fine Rolls. Aside from occasional references to him in relation to members of his family, all other records of administration from this period also fail to mention him\u2014except for the Pipe Rolls of the Exchequer, which list a recurring debt for Thomas in Nottinghamshire from 1242 that was a recognizance of an earlier debt owed by William Daniel (sometimes listed as William Butler) dating back to 1235.[CITATION-54] Such a long-standing debt was certainly not unusual. Richard Cassidy has demonstrated that the Pipe Rolls sometimes record debts that were owed over decades and by multiple generations.[CITATION-55] It is not until 1258 that a Thomas de Furnival can be seen taking an active role in records once more. This Thomas paid a single mark for an assize of novel disseisin, which was heard on 6 October.[CITATION-56] He is almost certainly the son of the crusader, rather than Thomas himself. Indeed, according to the Quo Warranto Rolls for the period 1274\u201375, it was also in the late 1250s that Thomas II began to receive an annual fee of 22from North Ecclesfield in Hallamshire, suggesting that he came of age during this period.[CITATION-57] The gap in time between the disappearance of Thomas de Furnival the crusader as an active player in records after a pledge of 40 marks in December 1239 and the subsequent appearance of another reference to a Thomas de Furnival in 1258, eighteen-and-a-half years later, points strongly to Thomas I\u2019s death during the Barons\u2019 Crusade. The claim that Thomas was a casualty of the Barons\u2019 Crusade is supported when the actions of the third Furnival brother are considered.William de Furnival returned home from crusade and lived into the 1260s. He married sometime around the year 1247, and his daughter, Helewisa, was born a year later.[CITATION-58] His name appears in a variety of records from the 1250s. In October 1252, for instance, he and his heirs were granted rights of free warren in the demesne lands of his manor of Gringele for a fee of half a gold mark and on the condition that he would not trespass into the king\u2019s forest.[CITATION-59] A year later, William was awarded a weekly market in the same holding as well as a yearly fair on the vigil, morrow and feast of the Liberation of St Peter (1 August).[CITATION-60] He appears in several more transactions, legal records and charters in the 1250s,[CITATION-61] perhaps most notably as a witness to a charter issued by his crusading companion Earl Richard of Cornwall while in London on 10 April 1257.[CITATION-62] Ancharter of the Lord Edward reveals that a year later, in April 1258, Edward confirmed that William\u2019s mother Matilda had handed over possession of the \u2018whole manor of Worksop\u2019 to him, and this has important ramifications for two aspects of the current investigation.[CITATION-63] First, it demonstrates that Matilda had been responsible for these parts of the Furnival lands after Thomas\u2019s death. This was hardly surprising, considering that Worksop was part of the Lovetot inheritance and therefore in Furnival hands as a result of her marriage to Gerard II. Secondly, it indicates that the Thomas de Furnival who paid for an assize of novel disseisin at Guildford six months later, and was active in Worksop and its environs after that time, was not yet in a position to take responsibility when Edward confirmed that the manor had been passed to William. The fact that this document was issued in April 1258, and that William took possession from Matilda, points to the conclusion that it was Thomas II, not Thomas I, who appeared in records thereafter.William survived for another six years. According to the chronicle of William Rishanger, William de Furnival was still alive and able to fight in 1264 when he was captured at the Battle of Northampton alongside his nephew, Gerard (son of Gerard III and Christiana Ledet).[CITATION-64] Rishanger listed \u2018Ger. De Furnivalle, Will. De eadem\u2019 (Gerard de Furnival, William of the same) among those caught.[CITATION-65] However, by 18 September that same year he had died.[CITATION-66] In the final weeks of his life, he played a prominent role in the Council of Barons, which had wrested control from Henry III by September 1264. Intriguingly, William spent his last days, as his brothers may have done, alongside Simon de Montfort.It thus becomes clear that, of the three Furnival brothers who set out to the Holy Land in 1240, two almost certainly perished while on crusade in the east. Writing in the 1250s, Matthew Paris knew that Gerard III had died on crusade in 1241, and contemporary records support this claim. Thomas was dead by Michaelmas 1243 at the latest, when his heir was noted in the Memoranda Roll for that year. While there remains the possibility that Thomas returned to Worksop in 1241 and died in that two-year period, it seems very likely that Pigott was correct to record in his poem that he died on crusade. It is curious, then, that by the late fifteenth century a narrative had developed in which Gerard survived and was sent back to repatriate Thomas\u2019s remains. To complicate the matter further, the only Furnival brother to survive the crusade and return home was William, yet he is missing entirely from the section of thethat deals with the crusade. Explaining these contradictions is a challenging task, but it is illuminating for what it reveals about how and why families remembered crusaders into the late Middle Ages and beyond.The second part of this article analyses the purpose, intended audience and sources of information of the, and contends that, while Pigott drew on written evidence for some of his information, the crusade section of theprovides evidence for an oral tradition concerning Thomas\u2019s death away from home. This account had mutated over two centuries under the stimuli of changing attitudes towards burial in the Holy Land, the influential genre of crusade romance (which was particularly popular in Worksop Priory\u2019s locale during the fifteenth century), and more recent concerns about the remains of John Talbot I, first earl of Shrewsbury and grandfather of the then lord of Worksop. It is suggested that Thomas\u2019s effigy, while initially erected as a means of commemorating the lost lord of Worksop for both dynastic and salvific purposes, acted as a material prompt for an oral tradition, preserving a memory of the crusader, albeit a malleable one, in the absence of a written history.A variety of views have been offered on the dating of the Worksop poem, ranging from 1410 to the early sixteenth century;[CITATION-67] however, evidence within the text points to a composition date within the period 1468\u201373. The author of the, Pigott, who was almost certainly a canon of the priory, ended his account after the birth of George Talbot (1468), stating \u2018I know nothing more (no ferther can I)\u2019.[CITATION-68] It seems that the work was written while George\u2019s father, John, was still alive, as Pigott explicitly wished him good fortune. This John Talbot, third earl of Shrewsbury and lord of Worksop, died in 1473, providing us with afor the poem\u2019s date of composition.[CITATION-69] It is also noteworthy that, at the end of the poem, John III\u2019s birth was recorded in Latin, further indicating that he was still alive at the time of composition. It was John III\u2019s great-nephew, the recusant John Talbot of Grafton, who was in possession of the \u2018old parchment\u2019\u2014perhaps the original\u2014used by the antiquary Robert Glover when he transcribed the poem in 1587.[CITATION-70] In many respects, theis typical of the genealogical literature produced by religious houses in the period. Such short foundation narratives could act as fragmented institutional histories, simple cartularies, commemorative texts, obituaries and mausoleum guides; but the primary purpose of this form of writing, especially when displayed on tablets, was the presentation of a mutually beneficial relationship between an institution and its patrons, legitimating the various transfers of power through the centuries.[CITATION-71] When on display in churches, such works were a means of making this information known to visitors, who, no doubt, would have communicated it to others further afield.were, after all, a means of public dissemination, and before the Reformation literate visitors to Worksop Priory would have been able to see the poem and read about the institution\u2019s history. As Jeanne Krochalis argued for the better-known Glastonbury Tablets, those who could not read them would have been able to rely on literate colleagues and the canons.[CITATION-72] As a field of scholarly enquiry, medieval church tablets have received only limited attention. Their poor survival rate perhaps explains this lack of interest\u2014only three known examples are extant from medieval England (two from York Minister and one from Glastonbury Abbey)\u2014but it is clear that they would have been a common sight in churches across England and further afield.[CITATION-73] Nigel Saul has drawn attention to the tablet that once informed visitors to Aldworth Church in Berkshire about the de la Beche monuments, as well as theof Burton Pedwardine in Lincolnshire, which displayed information about the Pedwardine family and their burial sites.[CITATION-74] The contents of these have not survived, but antiquaries occasionally produced copies. Although not a genealogical history,was transcribed in September 1658 from a work that had been displayed in Bawburgh Church, Norfolk. In this instance, the manuscript\u2019s case, which took the form of three panels made from Wainscott wood, was also sketched.[CITATION-75] There is no surviving description or illustration of the Worksop poem\u2019s tablet or case, but textual evidence makes it clear that thewas on display or intended for that purpose. When describing the martial effigy of Thomas de Furnival, Pigott addresses his readers directly, urging them to observe the monument for themselves. One aspect of the poem\u2019s purpose was, then, to inform readers about the funerary monuments they could see.Thealso appears to have served a liturgical purpose. As we have noted, genealogical literature played a key role in maintaining the attention and continued generosity of patrons towards an institution. Prayers for the departed were, of course, an integral aspect of this relationship, and in the opening stanza of the Worksop poem Pigott reminds his readers that the canons were bound to pray for the founder and his successors, which they did nightly \u2018and dayly at all houres\u2019. The final stanza of the poem elicits prayers from all and requests that clerics recite Psalm 129, commonly called:These saules, rehersed in generall afore,Have in remembrance what man so thow be;Have piety, and pray for theim evermore.Say Pater-noster, with the salutation Ave:And if thow a clerk be for there hye degree,Say De profundis withouten disdeyne,For theim and all christen, that suffres pane.[CITATION-76] Requests for the recitation of Psalm 129, most often along with other forms of commemoration, were common in churches across western Christendom.[CITATION-77] Theappeals to a wide audience, asking all types of men to pray for the souls of the institution\u2019s departed patrons.[CITATION-78] Following on from this final Middle English verse, the deaths of William de Lovetot, Worksop Priory\u2019s founder, and Thomas de Furnival II (d. 1291) were recalled in Latin: William on 7 April and Thomas on 12 May.[CITATION-79] The date of the latter\u2019s death is corroborated by the obituary list of nearby Beauchief Abbey.[CITATION-80] As noted above, the birth of the lord at the time of the poem\u2019s composition, John Talbot III, was recorded alongside these prominent figures, demonstrating that, while undeniably a means of ensuring their salvation through the prayers of visitors, the poem was also a way of glorifying the patron and linking him to his ancestry.Brian Golding has noted that several of the genealogical histories produced in England during the Middle Ages are remarkably inaccurate.[CITATION-81] In one respect, though, this does not matter. Theof such texts was to preserve the memory of generations past with the dual purpose of saving the souls of departed ancestors and entwining the current patrons within a lengthy family narrative. Accuracy was far less important than remembrance. This goes some way to explaining why William de Furnival was not recalled as a crusader in the poem even though he was the only one of the three brothers to return from the Barons\u2019 Crusade. He received considerable attention as a generous benefactor instead. Pigott noted that William was buried in Worksop\u2019s Lady Chapel and that he gave instructions to maintain five candles in this room. For Pigott, the benefit that William brought to the institution was more significant than his crusading activity when it came to preserving his memory; it did not matter that William\u2019s actions in the Holy Land were omitted from the crusade narrative contained in the poem. Crusading was not the most important aspect of the work, accounting for just three stanzas of twenty-nine (two directly and a third dealing with Thomas\u2019s effigy). In one respect, then, William\u2019s survival of the Barons\u2019 Crusade\u2014and thus his ability to make donations to Worksop in later years\u2014allowed him to figure in the institution\u2019s memory as a generous benefactor rather than a crusader.[CITATION-82] The sources at Pigott\u2019s disposal are also worth exploring. From 1187, the canons of Worksop possessed an ornate bestiary, aand numerous glosses, all of which had been acquired as a single gift from a canon of Lincoln Cathedral. Additionally, they had access to theof Ivo of Chartres, alongside a work of Isidore of Seville and several grammars; an ownership inscription reveals that Worksop carefully guarded a copy of Bede\u2019sin the fifteenth century.[CITATION-83] It seems likely that Pigott was also able to draw on at least one chronicle dealing with more recent times. When discussing the establishment of the priory, he writes:This was founded in King Herrye dayes,The first, as we rede, after the ConquestOf William conquerer, as the Cronicles says[CITATION-84] Then, when narrating the arrival of Gerard II to Worksop (referred to as Gerard I in the poem), Pigott states that he is working from a written source:Then by King Richard conquerer was sentFirst Furnivall Gerard, and he her marryedThat came out of Normandie streight as we rede.[CITATION-85] For some information, then, Pigott had at least one chronicle at his disposal,[CITATION-86] and it is possible that this text contained material on aspects of Furnival family history. He also seems to have had access to a Latin genealogy that stretched up to the period of Gerard de Furnival II\u2019s marriage to Matilda de Lovetot, as one was recorded in Dugdale\u2019sin the seventeenth century.[CITATION-87] Inscriptions in the priory were also available to Pigott, and he sometimes refers to them directly, as when relating the death of John Talbot II at the Battle of Northampton in July 1460. On this matter, Pigott states that the verse he had copied in Latin could be seen on John II\u2019s tomb.[CITATION-88] However, no such work or inscription is referred to during the section detailing Furnival involvement in the Barons\u2019 Crusade, and Pigott makes no allusions to a chronicle during these three verses. For the history of the Furnivals on the Barons\u2019 Crusade, then, Pigott must have been drawing on spoken tradition. Indeed, he states that he is doing so during his section on William de Furnival\u2019s abovementioned bequest of candles. Pigott says of William, \u2018And mych more he ordeyn\u2019d as we herd tell\u2019. It is not, therefore, unreasonable to suggest that Pigott was relying on oral history when discussing the crusading experiences of William\u2019s brothers. If this is the case, then Worksop\u2019s crusading history was preserved and transmitted in an oral account rather than by written record. The transformation of this narrative between 1241 and.1470 appears, however, to have been quite dramatic.Despite the account that we have pieced together from the evidence already discussed in this article, one possible starting-point for the Furnival narrative may have been the return of the actual bones of Thomas to Worksop. Transportation of remains was relatively common during the period of crusading to the east,[CITATION-89] and, as Nicholas Paul has convincingly argued, Saladin\u2019s victories in the 1180s instigated a heightened concern among crusaders to ensure burial in Christian-held territory.[CITATION-90] As a result, somereturned the remains of fallen comrades, as was the case for Count Philip of Flanders, who perished at the costly siege of Acre during the Third Crusade but was laid to rest at Clairvaux.At Stone Priory in Staffordshire, a fourteenth-century poem, which was also displayed on a tablet, recounted the return of Earl Hugh of Stafford\u2019s bones and heart from Rhodes by his squire, John Hinckley.[CITATION-91] Unlike the Worksop poem, contemporary evidence corroborates the account contained on Stone Priory\u2019s. On 6 April 1385, Earl Hugh made his will, leaving instructions that he was to be buried next to his wife in the priory. Two further additions were then made while Hugh was at Rhodes in September of the same year, one of which involved a gift of \u00a320 to John Hinckley, the squire mentioned in the poem.[CITATION-92] It is of course possible that the Stone poet was drawing on these sources rather than on direct knowledge, but Hugh of Stafford\u2019s verifiable case of repatriation is not an isolated one. The remains of the St Bees man in Cumbria, which have been identified as those of Anthony, Lord Lucy, were returned from a campaign in Lithuania by a fellow crusader in 1368;[CITATION-93] and, after his death at Cyprus in 1393, the body of John, Lord Roos, was buried at Rievaulx Abbey in Yorkshire.[CITATION-94] Most pertinently to the current investigation, Gerard de Furnival II\u2019s remains may have been taken to France for burial after his death at Damietta on the Fifth Crusade. However, we are reliant on thefor this information, which is clearly a problematic source.[CITATION-95] Rarer still than the return of remains immediately after death was the repatriation of bodies after actual burial in the Holy Land or neighbouring regions. It is possible that William the Conqueror ordered the return of his father Robert\u2019s remains from Nicaea in the 1080s, decades after the latter\u2019s burial while on pilgrimage;[CITATION-96] likewise, by 1398 Thomas Mowbray, marshal of England, had been able to secure the return of his father\u2019s \u2018bones or relics\u2019, which had been in the care of the Dominicans at Galata since his death in the 1360s.[CITATION-97] These examples notwithstanding, however, the vast majority of those who died on campaign or pilgrimage in the east and were buried there remained, especially in the thirteenth century. Indeed, the pilgrim graveyards at Akeldama and Acre are well known.[CITATION-98] Furthermore, some pilgrims actively sought burial in the Holy Land. Philip d\u2019Aubigny, for instance, is reported to have longed for such a grave.[CITATION-99] On his death in 1236, he was buried outside the Holy Sepulchre; a tomb slab claiming to mark his resting place still exists today.[CITATION-100] Regarding Thomas de Furnival, however, we know nothing of his wishes, nor do we know where he fell in 1241. It should be noted, though, that Thomas\u2019s death happened during the relatively brief period in the thirteenth century (1229\u201344) when Jerusalem was held by Christians, making less likely the claim in the Worksop poem that Matilda de Lovetot was concerned about her son\u2019s bones being buried among \u2018hathen\u2019 in the immediate aftermath of his passing. Had Thomas been in the massacred contingent of Theobald of Navarre\u2019s army, which lay scattered in Ayyubid territory after its defeat in the autumn of 1239, then this fear would have had an obvious historical basis; but, because of the lack of information regarding Simon de Montfort\u2019s contingent, it is impossible to say if Thomas was involved in any battles.While it is not possible to know what happened to Thomas\u2019s body in 1241, it is certain that he was not brought home in the way described by the Worksop poet. Moreover, it is unlikely that the narrative we glimpse in the fifteenth century took its final shape in the years immediately after his death. Nonetheless, it is possible that some of the materials we see in Pigott\u2019s apocryphal account began to take shape shortly after Thomas\u2019s demise. It is known that the creation of a memorial grave could be an attempt to fix the memory of a crusader when traditional commemorative practices had failed due to the absence of a body, and it seems likely that this was the intention at Worksop.[CITATION-101] The death of two Furnival brothers on the Barons\u2019 Crusade created a complicated problem for the family. From the late eleventh century, monastic institutions across England had acted as mausolea for Anglo-Norman families, playing an instrumental role in the establishment of a kin group\u2019s identity and authority within its domains of influence.[CITATION-102] By the mid-thirteenth century, however, the Furnivals were still unable to tap the considerable social capital generated by a family mausoleum. Gerard I\u2019s resting place is uncertain, although he never had been lord of Worksop, and the body of Gerard II was lost at Damietta in 1219, or perhaps taken for burial in France.[CITATION-103] Half a century after the establishment of the Furnivals in Worksop, the priory held no Furnival remains. Given this situation, it is likely that the construction of Thomas\u2019s martial effigy, accompanied by a memorial stone for Gerard, was a response to the disaster of the Barons\u2019 Crusade and an attempt to anchor his memory in the locality. Indeed, this would explain why the memorial was so unusually ornate for the period of its construction.Nigel Saul has observed that martial effigies, whether denoting graves or purely memorial in nature, did not begin to flourish in England until the 1270s.[CITATION-104] Examples do exist from before that period, but they tend to be from the highest-ranking families. Those of the earls of Pembroke at Temple Church most likely date to the 1230s, as does that of William Longesp\u00e9e I at Salisbury Cathedral. Sumptuously decorated memorials had begun to appear by the middle of the thirteenth century, but these, too, were confined to the highest echelons of lay society. A particularly ornate effigy was commissioned to commemorate the infant daughter of Henry III at Westminster in 1257,[CITATION-105] and the wife of Richard de Clare II decorated her husband\u2019s tomb with gold, silver and jewels in 1262.[CITATION-106] In this context, Thomas\u2019s ornamented martial effigy should be considered an early example of the elaborate funerary art that prospered after the 1270s, and it appears to provide clear evidence of a concerted and costly effort by the Furnivals to entrench the memory of the lost lord of Worksop in the family mausoleum. Not only had two Furnivals been lost together, they were the second generation of missing men in the family\u2014the third, if Gerard I is included. At a time when family mausolea were of increasing importance, this deficit had the potential to be remarkably detrimental; and it would have been a logical, and indeed strategic, decision to make Thomas\u2019s cenotaph particularly grand. The family needed a profound statement of authority to emphasise its long-standing presence in the region. When compared to the other, more modest monuments at Worksop, the material reminder of Thomas must have fired the imagination of all who saw it for generations.While no records survive relating to the construction of this memorial, it can be postulated with a reasonable degree of certainty that it was Matilda, mother of the three Furnival brothers, who was responsible for its creation. In fact, thecommemorates an aspect of her initiative in preserving theof her sons: it is Matilda who is said to have sent Gerard back to retrieve Thomas\u2019s body. Female kin often bore the burden of remembrance in thirteenth-century aristocratic families, as well as ensuring the spiritual well-being of departed family members.[CITATION-107] In this case, Matilda would have been faced with the prospect of preserving her family\u2019swithout the body of a single Furnival lord.[CITATION-108] This was a particularly pressing matter for her. Born in 1178, she was in her sixties when Thomas and Gerard died.[CITATION-109] Thomas\u2019s own wife, Bertha (probably de Ferrers), appears to have played very little role in the affairs of Worksop, although she is noted in the Fine Rolls in the 1250s in an action brought against her former brother-in-law.[CITATION-110] Moreover, Matilda retained power in the region until 1258, when she transferred Worksop into William\u2019s hands.[CITATION-111] Until that time, it was up to her to preserve her family\u2019s inheritance. Matilda may also have faced an ongoing threat from another line of her father\u2019s family. In 1207, her husband, Gerard de Furnival II, paid \u00a31000 and 15 palfreys to King John in order to be rid of the threat posed to their lands by another line of the Lovetots.[CITATION-112] As late as 1234, however, Matilda was still embroiled in enmity with a Richard de Lovetot over possession of territories around Worksop Priory.[CITATION-113] Stability must have seemed a pressing matter to her in the 1240s, with fatherless grandchildren to care for. Historians are often too keen to dismiss the sincerity of emotions such as the grief attributed to Matilda on hearing of the loss of her son, but, in this case, it is fair to surmise that dynastic interests as much as raw emotion motivated her to commission the impressive effigy described by Pigott.[CITATION-114] It is entirely possible that over the course of two centuries, the effigy became transformed into a grave in oral tradition. Two comparable mutations exist in crusading narratives connected to other institutions situated, like Worksop, within the medieval diocese of York: those of William Percy at Whitby and Roger de Mowbray at Byland Abbey. The first item in the surviving version of Whitby\u2019s cartulary\u2014the, which was written before 1180\u2014records William Percy\u2019s death during the First Crusade and includes the claim that he died within sight of Jerusalem at Mount Joy. William was then, according to the records of Whitby, \u2018honourably buried\u2019 (\u2018honorifice sepultus est\u2019).[CITATION-115] By the sixteenth century, however, an additional element had crept into the narrative. A suffragan bishop undertaking visitations in the county of York in 1535 recorded that William had died and was buried \u2018beyond sea []\u2019, but added that \u2018his heart is at Wytby\u2019.[CITATION-116] Considering the argument, set out by Nicholas Paul, that such narrative transformations were often a result of moments of crisis in the Holy Land, it seems likely that the story of William\u2019s heart developed in reaction to the arrival of worrying news from Outremer.[CITATION-117] The loss of large swathes of the Latin East to Saladin during the 1180s, including the area in which William was thought to have been buried, may have encouraged a more palatable tale to develop in which the founder\u2019s heart had been recovered; or perhaps it emerged after the fall of Acre in 1291. Whichever specific crisis we attach it to, the development of a narrative in which the abbey retained a portion of the lay founder\u2019s remains must have eased the communal anxiety felt at the institution.The same sixteenth-century bishop who noted the supposed resting-place of William\u2019s heart also reported that he had seen the \u2018sepulture\u2019 of Roger de Mowbray at Byland Abbey, less than 40 miles from Whitby. The historical Roger died in the Holy Land in the 1180s and appears to have been buried there. The monks of Byland Abbey, which Roger had founded, were aware of his passing at the end of the twelfth century.[CITATION-118] By the early fourteenth century, however, the monks of neighbouring Newburgh Abbey, which had also been established by Roger de Mowbray, reported that their founder was buried at Byland. More spectacularly, they reported that Roger had returned home to Yorkshire with a lion in tow after fighting and defeating a dragon on his way back from the Holy Land.[CITATION-119] As was the case at Whitby, it is likely that the narrative of return, even an entirely unrealistic one, eased the anxiety felt at an institution whose founder now lay buried in lands overrun by perceived heathens. Indeed, the emergence of this account has been dated to the early fourteenth century, shortly after the fall of Acre in 1291.[CITATION-120] The same argument can be made for the development of the crusade narrative at Worksop, but there was an additional issue in that case. Thomas de Furnival\u2019s son, Thomas II, who died in 1291, opted to be buried at \u2018the bare foote-fryers\u2019 in Doncaster rather than the priory.[CITATION-121] As the thirteenth century drew to a close, therefore, Worksop Priory held no remains of its Furnival lords other than William de Furnival\u2019s body\u2014but the family line was traced through Thomas II.It would be na\u00efve to attribute the development of these erroneous accounts to the creative energies of monkish writers willing to falsify history in the face of a crisis. It is far more likely that they were reciting an accurate account of the tradition as it stood when they wrote. Even in the case of Roger de Mowbray, despite the tale of his adventures with a lion, it is likely that the canons of Newburgh believed that Byland possessed his body. Indeed, that they focused on Byland rather than their own institution at Newburgh is indicative of this. Furthermore, it seems the author of the Byland foundation narrative was working from what he could in fact see, and, as R. Gilyard-Beer has suggested, Roger\u2019s gravestone is unlikely to have been a deliberate attempt to mislead anyone so much as a memorial erected for the purposes of remembrance.[CITATION-122] Likewise, Pigott tells us that it was possible to see Thomas de Furnival\u2019s ornate effigy at Worksop. This claim is given greater credibility by the prominent eighteenth-century antiquarian, Richard Gough, who in the 1790s observed an inscription on William de Furnival\u2019s tombstone, which by that time was positioned at the foot of the schoolmaster\u2019s door, rather than in the church itself, that matched the words recorded by Pigott.[CITATION-123] In the case of William Percy\u2019s heart, there is no indication that an object was involved, but it is evidence of a malleable oral tradition. Roger de Mowbray\u2019s grave appears to have been constructed in later years as a means of recalling him as founder; Thomas de Furnival\u2019s effigy was most probably a mid-thirteenth-century construction, erected to preserve his memory. In both cases there was an oral tradition, focused on a material object, that was adapted to mitigate anxieties caused by the changing situation in the Holy Land.Objects are often important as prompts to oral history,[CITATION-124] and material reminders of crusading endeavours appear to have been particularly deep repositories of memory. Anne E. Lester, Nicholas Paul and Jochen Schenk, among others, have shown that objects brought back from the east or associated with an ancestor\u2019s crusading experiences could form the focus of a narrative tradition, acting as conversational prompts for centuries. Items such as rings were sometimes worn by successive generations of crusaders, enhancing the power of the tradition attached to them.[CITATION-125] Likewise, Kevin Lewis has argued that the belt worn by knights Templar acted as a sartorial prompt, reminding the brothers of Bernard of Clairvaux\u2019s connection to their Order\u2019s early history. For Lewis, the oral tradition attached to the belt could vary dramatically from written texts, but this was not important. What truly mattered was the retention of a narrative in which St Bernard was instrumental in the Order\u2019s origins.[CITATION-126] As with the Worksop poem, remembrance, rather than accuracy, was the goal.As far as we know, Thomas de Furnival\u2019s memorial had no crusade-related imagery or inscription, but it can be postulated that it played the same role at Worksop as crusade objects or relics did elsewhere. The effigy\u2019s place in the, where its description follows on immediately from the crusade narrative, indicates that it was indelibly connected to the memory of Thomas\u2019s return. It was the material prompt to an oral tradition about the Furnival crusading past, acting, in the absence of a written account, to remind all who saw it of Thomas\u2019s death overseas. Over a period of two centuries, though, this narrative came to preserve only the core of the actual events, as was the case with the Templar belt and the gravestone of Roger de Mowbray.There are two further influences that may have shaped the crusading narrative at Worksop, both of them contemporary with the poem\u2019s likely date of composition. The first is the potential impact of crusade romance. The Worksop poem does not contain many of the fantastical elements associated with romance, such as Roger de Mowbray\u2019s lion and his battle with a dragon, but the crusade section in thedoes adopt the narrative structure of \u2018loss and recovery\u2019 that, as Lee Manion has argued, was highly influential on crusade romances in England throughout the Middle Ages.[CITATION-127] The narrative of Thomas de Furnival\u2019s crusade may have been particularly open to capture by this genre. While the extant records of Worksop Priory\u2019s medieval library leave no trace of romance literature, the poemsandappeared in the sumptuous Talbot Shrewsbury Book, commissioned by John Talbot\u2019s grandfather, John I, so there was an interest in poetry with a crusade or quasi-crusading setting within the family of the priory\u2019s Talbot patrons.[CITATION-128] There was also an identifiable interest in the genre in the vicinity of the priory, albeit as part of a wider concern with romance.originated in the East Midlands, as did the English, andwas most probably produced in the Midlands or Yorkshire.[CITATION-129] All three remained popular throughout the fifteenth century and were included, among others, in the collections of Robert Thornton, a Yorkshireman and compiler of romances.[CITATION-130] Thornton\u2019s collections also included.[CITATION-131] Considering Worksop\u2019s location within a lordship that straddled lands in the Midlands and South Yorkshire, the canons of Worksop may well have come into contact with the themes and narratives of romance.A second potential influence on the narrative of return within theis an ongoing concern with the body of John Talbot III\u2019s grandfather. As we have already seen, John Talbot I had died during the Battle of Castillon in 1453, a conflict often considered the last engagement of the Hundred Years War. His enduring reputation in England was of such stature that he had a prominent role in William Shakespeare\u2019sand, and his French contemporaries and opponents thought so highly of him that a church was erected on the site of his final battle. It became known as Notre-Dame de Talbot.[CITATION-132] Thegoes to great lengths to exalt him. Of the twenty-nine Middle English stanzas, five are devoted to John I.[CITATION-133] He was not, however, buried at Worksop. In fact, his burial place appears to have been a controversial issue in the period of the poem\u2019s composition.After the Battle of Castillon, Talbot\u2019s severely mangled corpse was discovered by his squire.[CITATION-134] He was initially buried on the battlefield and shortly after moved to Falaise. However, in the 1490s Talbot\u2019s bones were relocated to Shropshire by his grandson Gilbert, where they can still be found today.[CITATION-135] In the forty-year period between 1453 and 1493, therefore, Talbot\u2019s resting-place was a complex, changing and contested issue. It was during this period,.1470, that the Worksop poem was composed and concerns about the burial of Thomas de Furnival among \u2018hathens\u2019 aired.Given the state of the surviving evidence, it would be imprudent to argue with too much certainty that Pigott was deliberately attempting to promote Worksop to the Talbots as a potential location for John I\u2019s final resting place. It may be possible that the canons of Worksop were attempting to obtain possession of John Talbot I\u2019s remains by drawing on or emphasising similarities with John III\u2019s Furnival ancestors; but, even if they were simply using his prestige to enhance their own, the similarities between the inaccurate Furnival story and the fate of John Talbot I are undeniable. The immediate relevance of a story of a family hero\u2019s body lost overseas and buried in enemy territory must have been self-evident to the late fifteenth-century patrons of Worksop Priory.Those interested in whathappened to the Furnival brothers on the Barons\u2019 Crusade will inevitably view the Worksop poem as a deeply flawed source.[CITATION-136] To dwell on these errors is, however, to misrepresent the purpose of works such as the, which were often liturgical in nature and created to establish or maintain close ties between a monastic institution and its local nobility. Thewas far from historically accurate, but precision should not be the measure of its success. This composition was a tool used to convey the heroic and pious past, receive the favour of current patrons, and ensure a continued concern for the souls of the departed. Furthermore, as it was displayed on a tablet and written in the vernacular, clearly intended for public dissemination, theoffers an insight into one means by which such works were transmitted to a wide audience in late medieval England.Most importantly for the current study, close examination of the Worksop poem permits an analysis of how and why crusading activities were remembered\u2014or indeed not remembered, in the case of William de Furnival\u2014in the late Middle Ages. Even in the absence of a written history such as a chronicle, families and institutions employed other means to remember and present the crusading activities of generations past. This is a point that has been made with some force in recent scholarship, but theis proof that in some cases the mechanisms of family memory were able to maintain a knowledge of crusading heritage into the late medieval period without a written account. Moreover, while the poem\u2019s primary function was not to commemorate crusaders, crusading ancestry was considered a mark of prestige by the author. Thomas is portrayed as a martyr, rewarded by Christ for his sacrifice. Pigott deemed this worthy of remembrance, and he wished to promote that crusading past to the priory\u2019s visitors.At the time of its original construction, it is possible that Thomas de Furnival\u2019s effigy lay atop his partial remains, brought back by a companion, but more probable that it was a cenotaph, a reminder of Thomas in the absence of any part of his body. It was an ornate site of communal memory for the institution and the family, and it acted as a material prompt for the remembrance of Worksop\u2019s crusading past in the absence of a written record. Over the course of two centuries, various factors interacted with this site, causing substantial inaccuracies to creep into the Furnival crusading history. Anxiety arising from the seemingly irretrievable loss of the Holy Land in 1291, Thomas II\u2019s decision to be buried at nearby Doncaster, the influence of romance poetry, and ongoing concerns about the body of John Talbot I may all have played their part in moulding the Furnival crusading history into its late medieval form. At its most basic level, though, the oral account, visible to us now only through Pigott\u2019s fifteenth-century rhyme royal poem, retained a kernel of truth about the crusading experiences of the lost Furnival brothers. As a final point, it is worth remembering that in 1587 a manuscript of the poem was still in the hands of a Talbot\u2014a descendant of the Furnivals and a recusant. Themay, then, have retained its devotional purpose beyond the Reformation, prompting the commemoration of crusaders in the prayers of their descendants into the early modern era.",
