    "article": "The trial and execution of Charles I have been the subject of considerable historical study, especially in the last twenty years. One aspect of the trial, however, remains largely unexplored: the role of witness testimony. The witness depositions received on 24 and 25 January 1649 have sometimes been dismissed as a mere stalling tactic, intended to provide Charles with further time to consider entering a plea. In contrast, this article contends that the witnesses\u2019 depositions shed important new light on the trial. Exploring the witnesses\u2019 backgrounds allows us to connect individuals with the regiments of regicides such as John Hewson and John Barkstead. These connections, through the army petitions of 1648, also link the witnesses\u2019 testimony and, in broader terms, the trial, with the radical ideas of justice embodied in the Levellers\u2019 \u2018Large Petition\u2019. Connecting the trial with the arguments made in the petitions for justice of the autumn and winter of 1648/9 also allows us to reconsider the importance of the concept of \u2018blood guilt\u2019. This article suggests that, far from being marginal to the king\u2019s trial, the multi-faceted idea of blood guilt not only influenced the court\u2019s procedure (in terms of the calling of multiple witnesses) but also was central to many of the witness depositions. Finally, drawing on both historical and philosophical work on personal testimony, the article suggests that the witness depositions may be connected to the broader, non-legal purposes of \u2018witnessing\u2019 in offering narratives of personal suffering.In the past two decades, the trial and execution of Charles I have received considerable scholarly attention.[CITATION-1] Most recently, there has been an extensive debate between Sean Kelsey and Clive Holmes over Kelsey\u2019s argument that the trial was, in fact, a form of \u2018extended negotiation\u2019, in which the outcome of a capital sentence was by no means inevitable.[CITATION-2] The witness testimony delivered at the trial, however, remains largely unexplored.[CITATION-3] Some historians have accepted S.R. Gardiner\u2019s verdict that the hearing of testimony was essentially a delaying tactic, as the court sought a way out of the impasse presented by the king\u2019s repeated refusal to enter a plea.[CITATION-4] Kelsey has gone so far as to describe the evidence as \u2018next to useless\u2019 in legal terms.[CITATION-5] This neglect stands in marked contrast to the importance attached to witness depositions as evidence by early modern social and cultural historians. Since the pioneering micro-histories of Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and Carlo Ginzburg, scholars have recognised the value of depositions in providing access to the lived experience of those who otherwise feature little in the historical record.[CITATION-6] The evidence that depositions provide is undoubtedly heavily mediated, shaped by the questions of the interrogators and the interpolations and translations of the transcribing clerks.[CITATION-7] These issues are clearly present in the case of the testimony gathered at Charles I\u2019s trial. Nonetheless, witness depositions continue to be vital ways for historians to access the \u2018voices\u2019 of marginalised groups and to understand the agency conferred through the act of testifying.[CITATION-8] It will be argued here that investigating the witnesses\u2019 backgrounds and the way in which their evidence was gathered and presented in court and subsequently disseminated in print, as well as the content of their testimony, can provide us with significant insights into the king\u2019s trial and the understandings of justice which underpinned it. From the beginning, it was envisaged that the charges against the king would be substantiated by witness testimony. Many of the witnesses who were summoned were connected to the regiments of commissioners of the High Court such as John Hewson and John Barkstead. The evidence provided by these witnesses was not only meant to demonstrate that Charles was a traitor who had personally commissioned wars against his own people, but was also intended to confirm that he was a tyrant, murderer and public enemy. The charges of tyranny and murder were underwritten by the notion of \u2018blood guilt\u2019, an idea that has been associated with the regicide but has generally been thought to have been marginal to the trial itself. As presented in the witness evidence, however, blood guilt was connected to the ideas of justice contained in the petitions of autumn and winter 1648, especially the Levellers\u2019 \u2018Large Petition\u2019, which demanded that those responsible for the death and destruction of the civil wars should be held to account. Finally, there was also an important non-legal aspect of witnessing. As scholars of witnessing in the modern era remind us, its role is as much ethical as juridical, providing testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s suffering as much as evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt. For the Rump, the stories of suffering contained in the witness depositions formed a potentially powerful, if never fully exploited, counterpoint to the image of Charles as martyr-king.The act establishing the High Court of Justice, passed on 6 January 1649 by the Commons alone, affirmed the court\u2019s authority to examine witnesses under oath.[CITATION-9] The pamphlet(received by the bookseller-collector George Thomason on 11 January 1649) reported that, on 8 January, the commissioners who were to judge the king had resolved that heralds should proclaim throughout the country that \u2018all persons whatsoever, who have any matter of Fact, against Charles Stuart, King of England, are desired and invited, to bring their Charges, on Wednesday the 10 of this instant January, to the said Commissioners sitting in Westminster-Hall\u2019.[CITATION-10] Although this order is not recorded in the trial journal or in the proclamation announcing the establishing of the court, it is mentioned in other pamphlet and newsbook accounts.[CITATION-11] It was also clearly envisaged that the witnesses would be summoned to substantiate the prosecution case if Charles entered a plea. On 12 January, as part of its discussion of its procedure, the court considered how the witnesses were to be questioned, determining that the commissioners were not to address them directly but were to communicate any queries to the president for him to pose to the witnesses.[CITATION-12] This appears to be confirmed by a report in Samuel Pecke\u2019sthat, if the king made a plea, \u2018the witnesses will be ready to speake\u2019.[CITATION-13] Most telling of the early integration of witness testimony into the proceedings of the court was the close correlation between the witnesses\u2019 statements and the charge laid against the king, especially with regard to his presence at the head of his army at the battles of Edgehill, Newbury and Naseby, all of which spoke to significant evidence having been gathered in early January before the charge was drawn up.[CITATION-14] Indeed, on 15 January the court directed the committee drafting the charge to compare it \u2018with the Evidence\u2019, strongly indicating that witness statements had already been taken.[CITATION-15] Post-Restoration testimony also alleged that the prosecutor John Cook had administered oaths to witnesses before depositions were formally taken by the court, suggesting that evidence was taken from the witnesses earlier in Westminster Hall.[CITATION-16] A letter from the French ambassador to Scotland, Grignon, to the comte de Brienne dated 4 February 1649 (new style), noting the delivery of witness testimony against the king, indicated that some of those testifying were being recalled rather than summoned for the first time.[CITATION-17] The High Court issued warrants for the calling of witnesses on the afternoon of 23 January 1649.[CITATION-18] The witnesses were examined in private on the following day in the Painted Chamber, rather than in the public setting of Westminster Hall. This change of venue clearly came as a surprise to some of those attending the king\u2019s trial. As\u2026reported:This day it was expected the High Court of Justice would have met in Westminster Hall, about ten of the clock, but at the time appointed one of the Ushers by direction of the Court (then sitting in the Painted Chamber) gave notice to the People there assembled, That in regard the Court was then upon the examination of Witnesses in relation to present affairs, in the Painted Chamber, they could not sit there, but all persons appointed to be there, were to appear upon further Summons.[CITATION-19] The journal of the High Court made it clear that, as the king had \u2018not pleaded to issue\u2019, the examination of witnesses was \u2018[out of an abundance of caution], only for further sattisfaction of themselves\u2019.[CITATION-20] The journal then listed the names of thirty witnesses, who were examined by a committee of six civilian and eleven military commissioners. The following day, 25 January, the court sat in private as the witness testimony was heard before a larger group of commissioners (the journal named thirty-two plus \u2018divers others\u2019 as being present). Five additional witnesses were also summoned: a Mr Houlder or Holder, who was dismissed before giving evidence, Henry Gooch, William Cuthbert, Thomas Reade and Richard Price. The journal indicates that on the 25th, having been examined the day before by the committee, the witnesses simply had their depositions read to them, which they then averred were true under oath.[CITATION-21] This appears to be confirmed by the testimony of the regicide John Downes at his trial in 1660, when he stated that \u2018not one Member of the Court did hear one witnesse\u2019.[CITATION-22] The deposition of one of the witnesses named in the original list of thirty, William Arnop, does not appear to have been communicated to the commissioners, if it was taken. With Holder\u2019s dismissal, this meant that the depositions of thirty-three witnesses were recorded in the court journal.As we will see, the Rump did eventually authorise the publication of the witnesses\u2019 evidence. Nonetheless, before the Restoration, little information appears to have leaked into the English press concerning the identity of the witnesses at Charles I\u2019s trial or the content of their testimony. In contrast to the proceedings in Westminster Hall, the depositions heard in the Painted Chamber were not reported in print in England, apart from brief summaries in contemporary newsbooks.[CITATION-23] The trial journal itself, on the other hand, provides considerable information about the witnesses who gave evidence against the king. Four manuscript copies of the journal survive: one in the state papers, SP 16/517 (sometimes referred to as \u2018Bradshawe\u2019s journal\u2019 and attested to by the clerks of the court, Andrew Broughton and John Phelps), one in the UK parliamentary archives (the \u2018engrossed\u2019 copy), one in the Harleian manuscripts in the British Library and a further text in the Beinecke Library.[CITATION-24] Barring some relatively minor variations, the journals largely record the witness testimony in a similar fashion. However, the Beinecke copy does include one significant difference: when the names of the witnesses first appear in this version of the journal, only thirteen are listed, with a further note on the reverse of the page stating \u2018Here write the rest of the names [?] of the witnesses which yow shall find in a loose sheete of paper afor the w[ri]tt [?] for exacucon of the Kinge\u2019.[CITATION-25] The full list of witnesses then appears several pages later, arranged in two columns as in \u2018Bradshawe\u2019s journal\u2019.[CITATION-26] The transcripts of the depositions give details of witnesses\u2019 place of residence, age and occupation or social status, as well as their names.[CITATION-27] These biographical summaries were common in civil law procedure and in line with the advice of contemporary legal manuals.[CITATION-28] There were similarities, too, with the way in which witness testimony was gathered and recorded in Parliamentarian courts martial and in sequestration proceedings.[CITATION-29] The court heard testimony from former Royalist soldiers, though only one of the witnesses called to give evidence was clearly in Parliament\u2019s custody at the time of the trial: the Mr Houlder or Holder who was summoned on 25 January. Sean Kelsey has identified this witness as Thomas Holder, reportedly an agent for the Prince of Wales, who was arrested while attempting to raise arms and troops in Colchester.[CITATION-30] Holder was ultimately excused from giving evidence as \u2018the Commissioners finding him alredy a Prisoner and perceiving that the questions intended to be asked of him tended to accuse himselfe thought fitt to spare his examination\u2019.[CITATION-31] (It had been resolved earlier at a council of war on 15 December that proceedings should be launched against Holder as a Royalist spy.)[CITATION-32] Only two of the thirty-three witnesses from whom depositions were taken clearly identified themselves as Royalists. John Bennett, a glover of \u2018Harwood\u2019 (Harewood) in Yorkshire, claimed in his account of the raising of the royal standard at Nottingham that he only took up arms for the king under duress, after the Royalists threatened to plunder the town if men did not join the king\u2019s cause. Thomas Ives, a husbandman of \u2018Boysett\u2019 (Bozeat) in Northamptonshire, said in his testimony that he was one of a party of horse ordered to protect Royalist infantry retrieving their dead at the first battle of Newbury.[CITATION-33] The testimony of other witnesses, such as Henry Hartford of Stratford-upon-Avon, also strongly suggested that they had served in the king\u2019s forces.[CITATION-34] C.V. Wedgwood argued, however, that many of these witnesses were probably soldiers who had \u2018at one time served in the Royalist ranks, and later joined the victorious Army\u2019.[CITATION-35] This certainly seems to have been the case with William Brayne, who testified to marching with the king\u2019s army from Nottingham to Derby. Brayne was later accused of being a Parliamentarian spy and, as we will see, he certainly later had a career in Parliament\u2019s army.[CITATION-36] Wedgwood\u2019s thesis also appears to be confirmed by the testimony at Daniel Axtell\u2019s trial in 1660 of another witness against the king, Samuel Burden. Burden stated that of the witnesses \u2018there were eight or nine of us\u2019, who \u2018had been in the king\u2019s army in former times\u2019 but who were now in Parliament\u2019s service (in Burden\u2019s case, in Axtell\u2019s own company).[CITATION-37] Other witnesses were serving Parliamentarian soldiers, such as Arthur Younge or Young, described as a Citizen and Barber-Surgeon of London, of about 29 years of age. The Barbers\u2019 Company records show an \u2018Arthur Yonge\u2019 being apprenticed to Thomas Turner on 6 May 1637.[CITATION-38] As Young\u2019s own testimony made clear, however, he was better known as the soldier who had captured the royal standard at the battle of Edgehill, a feat which was celebrated in print in John Vicars\u2019s(1643). This referred to the king\u2019s red regiment being routed by Sir William Constable\u2019s Redcoats, \u2018one of whose Ensignes (Master Young by name) had the first honour of taking the King\u2019s Standard\u2019. Young would rise to the rank of captain, and at the time of the trial was serving in the regicide John Barkstead\u2019s regiment of foot.[CITATION-39] William Arnop, who, as has been noted, was summoned and sworn to give evidence but whose deposition was not recorded, was another witness whose military career connected him to the regicides. A Captain-lieutenant Arnop is listed as being present at a council of war held at Bury St Edmunds on 29 May 1647.[CITATION-40] By 1650 Arnop had been promoted to major in the regicide John Hewson\u2019s regiment, and by 1651 had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel. During his service in Ireland, Arnop acted as president of the court martial in Dublin and as a commissioner for the High Court of Justice in Ireland. He appears to have continued to serve in the army in Ireland until the Restoration.[CITATION-41] William Brayne, mentioned above, of \u2018Wixhall\u2019 (Whixhall) in Shropshire, was described as a gentleman but was another witness who held officer rank in the Parliamentarian army, being promoted to major in 1644 when he was given command of the garrison at Wem in that county. Brayne is now better known for his career after the regicide. He was made lieutenant colonel in the English army in Scotland in 1653, and in 1655 appointed governor of Inverlochy. The pinnacle of Brayne\u2019s career came in the following year, when Cromwell appointed him commander-in-chief of the English forces in Jamaica.[CITATION-42] Thomas Rawlins, identified in court as a gentleman of \u2018Hanslopp\u2019 (Hanslope) in Berkshire, was probably a major in Daniel Axtell\u2019s regiment.[CITATION-43] John Moore, described as a gentleman of Cork, was most probably the John Moore who saw active service in Ireland but returned to England to recruit in 1648, dying in Ireland in May 1650.[CITATION-44] John Pyneger, recorded in the trial journals as a yeoman of Heanor, Derbyshire, served as quartermaster in Thomas Sanders\u2019s regiment of horse.[CITATION-45] Army connections are also suggested in the case of Diogenes Edwards, described in the trial journals as a butcher of Carston in Shropshire, of 21 years of age. Edwards\u2019s name can be found on a land claim in Tipperary, Ireland, along with that of William Steevens. This was probably the William Steevens who served as a sergeant in Sir Arthur Haselrig\u2019s regiment.[CITATION-46] The wide geographical spread of witnesses, coming from across England, Wales and Ireland, is a likely result of them being drawn from regiments of Parliament\u2019s army: Stephen Roberts has suggested that the significant number of witnesses from Wales may have come from units in the service of the Welsh regicides Thomas Horton and John Jones.[CITATION-47] Horton was one of the commissioners appointed to examine the witnesses and Jones was one of the commissioners present when their testimony was read.[CITATION-48] Equally, that five of the witnesses were drawn from Shropshire may be connected to the support given by Colonel Humphrey Mackworth and the garrisons of Shrewsbury and Ludlow to enacting \u2018exemplary\u2019 justice against the authors (plural) of the late troubles \u2018without respect of persons\u2019.[CITATION-49] The connections of some witnesses via the army to the regicides, and the preponderance of military figures on the committee for examining the witnesses, may indicate that testimony was coached or orchestrated. Burden claimed after the Restoration that he had been \u2018commanded\u2019 by Axtell to provide evidence.[CITATION-50] Other witnesses may have been directed to testify. As Sean Kelsey has shown, Richard Price, the last witness to give evidence, appears to have acted in a clerical capacity for the court, assisting in drafting the charges against the king well before he was called to give evidence.[CITATION-51] The career advancement of some witnesses after the trial, such as Brayne, might also indicate that inducements as well as threats were offered to witnesses to testify. It was certainly alleged by Clement Walker, in the third part of his, entitled(1651), that the prospect of career advancement, as well as cash bribes, was used in other treason trials to elicit testimony: \u2018Of this sort areandset on work to betray [Sir John]and [Eusebius]\u2026 For which [Major John]had 300l and a Troope of horse conferred upon him\u2019.[CITATION-52] Walker\u2019s accusations reflected longer-standing assumptions that the testimony of poorer witnesses could be bought with \u2018gifts\u2019, financial or otherwise.[CITATION-53] Some broader evidentiary issues with witness depositions also make it difficult for us to treat them straightforwardly as the individual\u2019s own independent account. As the work of Andrea Frisch on eyewitnessing in early modern France has made clear, written testimony of this kind presents us not with authentic individual narratives but instead with texts constructed out of legal exchanges between witnesses and their interrogators.[CITATION-54] This could mean that what appear to be vivid, personal recollections in fact conceal monosyllabic responses to lengthy and possibly leading interrogatories.[CITATION-55] Indeed, some critics of the republic\u2019s courts claimed that the \u2018catechizing interrogatories\u2019 and \u2018catching questions\u2019 posed by its inquisitors were as bad as those put to defendants by the courts of High Commission and Star Chamber before the civil wars.[CITATION-56] The manuscript journals of Charles I\u2019s trial provide no record of the questions posed to the deponents, only of the written depositions that resulted from their interrogation. Given the consistency of elements of the witness testimony, however\u2014the references to the king\u2019s presence at the raising of the royal standard at Nottingham and/or on the battlefield\u2014it is highly likely that interrogatories were used in the king\u2019s trial. Burden certainly claimed in his post-Restoration testimony that he was asked to provide evidence on where he had seen the king in battle, and whether he had been present when the king raised his standard at Nottingham.[CITATION-57] The identity of these witnesses is also critical to understanding the value of their testimony. Although it has not proved possible to trace the biographies of all of the witnesses, where evidence can be found it confirms the description given in court: Burden, for example, was born in Lyneham, Wiltshire, as stated in the trial, and, similarly, John Pyneger of Heanor, Derbyshire appears to have been buried in that parish in 1676.[CITATION-58] If the intent of listing civilian occupations for serving soldiers was to deceive the commissioners, the value of that subterfuge was questionable. After all, as Kelsey has noted, the witness statements collectively represented \u2018the colourful wartime recollections of a handful of nonentities\u2019. While seven witnesses were described as being \u2018gentlemen\u2019, the majority were \u2018men of lowly, even completely insignificant social standing\u2019.[CITATION-59] Social status was a key criterion for assessing the credibility of witnesses in the early modern period.[CITATION-60] In terms of contemporary values, therefore, the butchers, smiths and cobblers assembled to give testimony against the king did not appear to present the most convincing set of deponents.Sean Kelsey has suggested that the selection of these individuals, rather than higher-status military or civilian figures, was a product of the commissioners\u2019 caution: if the trial failed, it would be a set of expendable figures who would face repercussions.[CITATION-61] This is certainly plausible, given the allegations already noted of rank-and-file soldiers being commanded to testify. It is worth stating, however, that there were several witnesses (Arnop, Brayne, Moore, Price and Young) whose enduring commitment to the Parliamentarian cause suggests that they may have given evidence willingly. Moreover, rank-and-file soldiers, especially those who had served on the Royalist side, were much better placed to support the charge that the king had \u2018trayterously and maliciously levyed war against the present Parliament and the people therein represented\u2019. These witnesses were more able than Parliamentarian commanders to provide direct evidence that Charles was present at the raising of the royal standard, that he had been in arms at the major battles of the civil war, and that he had personally exhorted his troops to fight.[CITATION-62] Equally, if the High Court of Justice was so concerned with reprisals against members of the court, it is hard to understand why it publicised its own proceedings, including the names of commissioners and officers of the court. Lists of court personnel were clearly being circulated and purchased even before the open proceedings began.[CITATION-63] The public nature of the court proceedings would have serious repercussions for participants, beginning with the murder of Isaac Dorislaus in 1649 and finishing with the trials of the regicides in 1660\u201362.[CITATION-64] In contrast, as has already been noted, the identity of the witnesses does not appear to have become common knowledge in England until after the Restoration.[CITATION-65] Yet witness testimony had been utilised in earlier Parliamentarian pamphlets, which, like the evidence of the witnesses in 1649, had sought to blame the king for encouraging Royalist depredations.[CITATION-66] The decision not to publish the witnesses\u2019 names and full testimony in 1649 therefore appears to have been a conscious choice to avoid revealing the inner workings of the court and thereby the links between some witnesses and the military commissioners. As we will see, the decision was probably also informed by the failure of the Rump\u2019s propaganda strategy for the trial.There was, arguably, an ideological as well as legal rationale for selecting these witnesses. On the afternoon of 23 January, before the witnesses were summoned, the president of the court, John Bradshaw, in attempting once more to get Charles to enter a plea, reminded the king that \u2018Justice knowes noe respect of p[er]sons\u2019.[CITATION-67] There was a clear allusion here to Deuteronomy 1:17, \u2018You shall have no respect of person in judgement, ye shall not feare the face of man for the judgement is Gods\u2019. Bradshaw\u2019s intention was undoubtedly to convince the king (and perhaps some of the commissioners) that his status afforded him no immunity from the court\u2019s judgment. As we will see, Bradshaw also pre-empted the witness testimony by claiming that the king\u2019s actions had already spoken for him, writing their meaning \u2018in bloody Characters throughout the Kingdom\u2019.[CITATION-68] These words, however, also resonated with Leveller demands, namely the sixth point of the \u2018Large Petition\u2019 of 11 September:That you would have made both Kings, Queens, Princes, Dukes, Earls, Lords and all Persons, alike liable to every Law of the Land, made or to be made; that so all persons even the Highest might fear and stand in aw, and neither violate the publick peace, nor private right of person or estate \u2026 without being lyable to accompt as other men\u2026[CITATION-69] Similar arguments had been made earlier at Putney, though they had been rejected by Henry Ireton, except in the case of those holding public office\u2014a caveat that would loom large by 1649.[CITATION-70] The choice of such \u2018lowly\u2019 witnesses may, therefore, have been intended to show the right of the people to try their king. After the Lords rejected the legislation establishing the High Court of Justice, the Commons had made a bold assertion of popular sovereignty in their declaration of 4 January 1649:The Commons of England, in Parliament assembled, do Declare, That the People are, under God, the Original of all just Power: And do also Declare, that the Commons of England, in Parliament assembled, being chosen by, and representing the People, have the Supreme Power in this Nation.[CITATION-71] As much as this statement may have been expedient, designed to overcome the intransigence of the upper house, it was also in line with the opening demand of the Large Petition: \u2018That you would have made good the supreme of the people, in this Honourable House, from all pretences of Negative Voices, either in King or Lords\u2019.[CITATION-72] Similarly, the rejection of evidence on the grounds of self-incrimination also reflected Leveller demands, again articulated in the Large Petition, that \u2018you would have freed all men from being examined against themselves\u2019.[CITATION-73] The description of current or former New Model Army soldiers by their civilian occupations or status (Arthur Young, barber surgeon, or William Brayne, gentleman) made little sense as an act of deception, given that both their testimony and, in some cases at least, personal acquaintance would have made clear to the commissioners their service in Parliament\u2019s cause. Instead, combined with the inclusion of testimony from some former Royalists, it may have been intended to substantiate the idea that the court was delivering the judgment of the people of England, not just the censure of the \u2018well affected\u2019. In Cook\u2019s words, the witnesses had been called \u2018on the People of England\u2019s behalf\u2019.[CITATION-74] The testimony of several witnesses spoke of the loss of life on \u2018both sides\u2019 in the conflict, a phrase repeated in eight of the depositions with similar expressions used in several others.[CITATION-75] Before the hearing of their testimony, and recalling the words of the charge against Charles I, Cook had urged the court to listen to the cry of \u2018in[n]ocent blood\u2019 that demanded justice.[CITATION-76] These references to blood-letting also echoed the Large Petition, which asked Parliament to lay to \u2018heart all the abundance of innocent bloud that hath bin spilt\u2019.[CITATION-77] The intent of this testimony, therefore, was arguably to convince the commissioners that they were delivering not victors\u2019 justice, but rather the judgment of a sovereign people upon their king.Sean Kelsey has claimed, nonetheless, that the evidence provided by the witnesses against the king was \u2018extremely weak\u2019, and unlikely to have persuaded many of Charles\u2019s judges.[CITATION-78] It can, however, be argued instead that both the substance of the witness testimony and the fact that it was provided by multiple deponents was of considerable importance. The intent of many of the depositions, as both contemporaries and historians have noted, was to show that Charles had personally initiated the conflict\u2014many of the statements reported seeing him at the raising of the royal standard at Nottingham\u2014and that he had been present in arms (\u2018sword in hand\u2019, as the report of the French ambassador put it) at the major battles of the civil war.[CITATION-79] As Alan Orr has argued, these accounts served to substantiate the reconfiguring of treason as the crime of waging war against a sovereign people, rather than against a sovereign king. Charles\u2019s actions were both a usurpation of sovereignty\u2014the right to wage war being a key marker of sovereign power\u2014and an unnatural act: how could a sovereign people authorise their king to wage war against them?[CITATION-80] Here too, the substance of the witness statements connected to the claims of the Large Petition, which alleged that the \u2018infinite spoil and havock\u2019 of the war had been initiated by \u2018express Commissions from the King\u2019.[CITATION-81] As the barrister and historian Geoffrey Robertson observed in his biography of Cook, however, the witnesses not only testified that Charles had waged war against Parliament \u2018personally and enthusiastically\u2019 but also that he \u2018bore command responsibility for the war crimes of his soldiers and that he was responsible as an individual for ordering and approving the torture of prisoners and plunder of towns\u2019.[CITATION-82] The concept of \u2018war crimes\u2019 is modern, but \u2018command responsibility\u2019 was an accepted element of the early modern laws of war and was held to extend even to rulers.[CITATION-83] Parliamentarian print had already made use of eyewitness testimony to document Royalist atrocities, such as those committed by Prince Rupert\u2019s troops at the storming of Bolton in 1644.[CITATION-84] Similarly, there can be no doubt that, from the beginning of the gathering of witness testimony, Charles was being accused of crimes relating to the conduct as well as the commissioning of the war. The first witness whose deposition was recorded, William Cuthbert of Patrington, Yorkshire, spoke of plundering and seizure of goods by the king\u2019s men outside Hull in the summer of 1642. As has already been noted, the next witness, John Bennett, stated that he had only joined the king\u2019s forces because of the threat of plunder and devastation made by Royalists.[CITATION-85] These statements also served to substantiate the charges of tyranny and murder which had been levelled against the king. Tyranny was understood as rule without regard for, or in violation of, the law. Infractions of the laws of war might be considered to be within that definition. Contemporary understandings of tyranny, however, were as much to do with the monarch\u2019s character as with their treatment of the legal and constitutional system. Where good kings were constant, self-controlled, honest and open, tyrants were capricious, impulsive, duplicitous and covert.[CITATION-86] As Charles\u2019s father James VI and I put it in a speech delivered in 1603, later much used by Parliamentarian writers, \u2018the proude and ambitious Tyrant doeth thinke his Kingdome and people are onely ordeined for satisfaction of his desires and unreasonable appetites\u2019.[CITATION-87] One witness in particular, Humphrey Browne of \u2018Whitsondine\u2019 (Whissendine), Rutland, gave evidence which depicted the king as both cruel and unstable. Browne stated that, though the terms of surrender at Leicester had agreed that neither money nor clothes should be taken from the surrendering Parliamentarian forces, Royalist soldiers ignored this and began to strip, cut and wound them. Browne alleged that when the Royalist officers attempted to restrain their charges the king rebuked his commanders, reporting that Charles cried out \u2018I doe not Care if they Cutt them three tymes more, for they are mine Enimies, or Words to that effect\u2019.[CITATION-88] Thomas Rawlins similarly testified that at \u2018Foy\u2019 (Fowey) in Cornwall, the king\u2019s soldiers plundered the town in contravention of the articles of agreement and that, despite Charles\u2019s proximity to the soldiers, he made no attempt to restrain them.[CITATION-89] It is worth noting that both the storming of Leicester and the behaviour of Royalist soldiers following the Battle of Lostwithiel had been represented by pro-Parliamentarian writers as notorious incidents of Cavalier cruelty, committed in the king\u2019s presence.[CITATION-90] Two of the last witness statements, from Henry Gooch and Richard Price, spoke to the king\u2019s untrustworthiness and inconstancy. Gooch\u2019s testimony, the only deposition referring to the second civil war, demonstrated that the king was prepared to issue commissions to royalists (via his son) while he was negotiating the Treaty of Newport.[CITATION-91] Price\u2019s testimony, outlining the king\u2019s part in the Ogle or Brooke plots involving Independents and the City Peace party, as Kelsey has suggested, could have been intended to show that the duplicity of some of the Parliament\u2019s supposed allies had also contributed to Charles\u2019s double-dealing.[CITATION-92] However, Price also reported that the king had said the Independents should have as much freedom, and as much success, as his Irish subjects had had against the Parliament\u2019s forces. This was surely also meant to show that Charles was in cahoots with papists, and so faithless that he would promise anything to anyone.[CITATION-93] Kelsey has proposed that the evidence of these two witnesses, neither of whom were included in the original list of deponents and who appeared at the very end of the hearing of witness testimony, may have been \u2018specially commissioned\u2019.[CITATION-94] The specific intent of Gooch\u2019s testimony certainly could have been to undercut the king\u2019s argument that the trial had prevented him from successfully concluding the Treaty of Newport. The broader purpose of this testimony, however, may have been to suggest to the commissioners that any expressions of contrition offered by the king, acknowledging his crimes, were not to be trusted.The depositions were also critical to underwriting the charge of murder against the king. As we have seen, many witnesses referred to the large numbers of casualties on both sides of the conflict. John Bennett\u2019s testimony was remarkably precise in this respect, stating that he had seen a list of those slain at Edgehill which placed the total number of casualties at 6,559.[CITATION-95] Arguably, these testimonies were intended to fulfil Bradshaw\u2019s resolution \u2018to make Inquisition\u2019 for \u2018the i[n]nocent blood that had bin spilt\u2019 in the war \u2018which was fixed uppon him as the principall Author of it\u2019.[CITATION-96] Since the publication of Patricia Crawford\u2019s pathbreaking article in 1977, historians have acknowledged that the notion of \u2018blood guilt\u2019 was present in discussions both before and after the trial about the king\u2019s culpability for loss of life during the civil war.[CITATION-97] Both Bradshaw (during the trial) and Cook (after) referred to the idea of blood guilt and the biblical texts that were commonly cited in relation to it (Genesis 9:6; Numbers 35:33).[CITATION-98] As Crawford also noted, and Phil Baker has more recently reaffirmed, accusations of \u2018blood guilt\u2019 did not necessarily support arguments for capital punishment, and could be used instead to deliver moral admonition. A striking example was provided by Bradshaw in his closing statement to Charles, in which he cited the case of King David, who expressed repentance before God for his role in the death of Uriah the Hittite, the husband of David\u2019s mistress, Bathsheba, so that God \u2018was pleased to accept of him, and to give him his Pardon\u2019.[CITATION-99] Here, a biblical reference to blood guilt was being invoked to urge royal contrition, rather than to justify regicide.[CITATION-100] Moreover, with the exception of Clive Holmes\u2019s work, the concept of blood guilt has generally been treated as marginal to the trial, with most historians seemingly accepting Crawford\u2019s argument that the idea was incompatible with the legal arena in which the king was brought to account.[CITATION-101] Understood in a broader sense than an Old Testament \u2018blood for blood\u2019 reading, however, the idea of blood guilt may not only explain the multiple references to casualties and blood-shedding in the witnesses\u2019 testimony, but also the fact that the witnesses were called at all, despite Charles\u2019s refusal to enter a plea. A post-regicide defence of the proceedings against the king,, published in February 1649, once again used the familiar verses from the book of Numbers to justify Charles\u2019s death. However, this work also cited chapter 35, verse 30 as well as those following (using the Geneva Bible text): \u2018Whosoever killeth any person, the Judge shall slay the murtherer through witnesses etc.\u2019.[CITATION-102] The meaning of this passage is clearer in the Authorised Version: \u2018Whosoever killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any personto die\u2019. The hearing of multiple witnesses, and the resolution following that testimony to condemn the king to death, was therefore in line with Old Testament injunctions regarding murder and blood guilt.Of course, receiving witness testimony also added to the impression that some form of legal due process was being followed. Even some of those who supported the trial of the king, such as the Judge Advocate for the Army in the North, Thomas Margetts, were concerned that if the proceedings appeared rushed it would tend \u2018to the presenting of malicious designs and less of Justice\u2019.[CITATION-103] This point was acknowledged in Cook\u2019s(1649). Here, Cook vindicated the court not only on the basis of the evidence that it had heard but also for the manner in which it had heard it:This high court did not only consult with Heaven for wisdom and direction \u2026 but examined witnesses for several days upon oath to inform their consciences and received abundant satisfaction in a judicial way \u2026 as judges, which before was most notorious and known to them as private persons.[CITATION-104] The language of conscience used here by Cook was in line with early modern English law and legal treatises relating to witness testimony, which defined its purpose as being to inform the consciences of juries. Equally, the calling of multiple witnesses in a treason case was also in accordance with contemporary legal procedure and with early modern assumptions regarding witness credibility, which, as Barbara Shapiro has argued, valued \u2018skill, fidelity, impartiality, and the number of observers as well as social status\u2019.[CITATION-105] In an early modern English context, biblically based claims were compatible with legal arguments. The idea of blood guilt was incorporated into puritan social, legal and political critiques; indeed, the language of making \u2018inquisition\u2019 for \u2018innocent blood\u2019 had been the substance of godly sermons to magistrates in the mid-1640s.[CITATION-106] As Kevin Killeen has recently argued, there has been a tendency to treat scriptural arguments relating to the regicide primarily in terms of the motivations for king-killing, as evidence of millenarian \u2018zeal\u2019 rather than as a critical framework for structuring early modern political thinking. This is despite the fact that John Cook\u2019s anti-monarchical tract,(1651), was rooted in biblical examples.[CITATION-107] \u2018Civill Prudence for governing a state or commonwealth\u2019, Cook said, was to be \u2018fetcht and drawne from the sacred fountaine of Scripture, rather than the puddles of history\u2019. Indeed, Cook specifically used within this tract the injunctions in the book of Numbers requiring murder to be proven by multiple witnesses.[CITATION-108] As well as informing the manner in which the charges against the king were substantiated, ideas of blood guilt were also critical in assigning responsibility to Charles for the loss of life in the civil wars. As David Como\u2019s research has demonstrated, the pretence that it was the king\u2019s \u2018evil counsellors\u2019 who were responsible for the bloodshed of the civil war was challenged in a number of petitions and pamphlets from 1643 onwards. The July 1643 petition which urged a \u2018General Rising\u2019 in defence of Parliament denounced the king for having brought thousands of subjects to \u2018slavery or destruction\u2019.[CITATION-109] A year later, the pamphlet(1644) warned the king to expect \u2018revenge for the blood of thy subjects\u2019.[CITATION-110] The tract prefigured some of the witness statements at the king\u2019s trial by holding Charles responsible for acts of plunder committed by his troops, and for making the ground of \u2018Kenton-field\u2019 (Edgehill) \u2018red with the blood of his subjects\u2019.[CITATION-111] By 1647, John Lilburne was using Genesis 9:6 to argue that no-one should be exempt from responsibility for the shedding of \u2018England\u2019s innocent blood\u2019, whether \u2018kings, princes, dukes \u2026 or gentlemen\u2019. Notably, Lilburne here made accusations of blood guilt against a Parliamentarian officer, Colonel Edward King.[CITATION-112] Calls for the execution of \u2018impartial justice\u2019 were often grounded in the need to give satisfaction for the innocent blood that had been shed in the civil wars, as the petitions issued in the autumn and winter of 1648 demonstrated.[CITATION-113] This point has been stressed in recent work on these petitions by John Rees and Norah Carlin. Rees distinguishes between an understanding of blood guilt as a providentially ordained directive to exact retribution or face divine wrath, and the idea of blood guilt present in many Leveller and army petitions prior to the trial of Charles I. The notion of blood guilt present in these texts was a moral and political argument for justice as a recompense for both the army\u2019s and the kingdom\u2019s losses.[CITATION-114] Indeed, as Carlin has noted, only two of the petitions for justice issued in late 1648 and early 1649 directly employed the familiar biblical texts from Genesis and Numbers. Far more common were references to blood in relation to the nation\u2019s suffering and loss.[CITATION-115] Allusions of this kind in the petitions did not always presume the king\u2019s guilt, instead urging that \u2018the King (instead of a Treaty) be brought to a fair trial, to make answer for all the innocent bloud that hath been spilt in the land\u2019.[CITATION-116] It is a similar sense of blood guilt which comes through most strongly in the witness statements: the grim arithmetic of battlefield casualty lists and the legal account that must now be made for them, rather than the providential imperative to assuage divine wrath by extinguishing the king as a \u2018Man of Blood\u2019. These kinds of arguments are also evident in petitions produced by the two regiments with clearest connections to some of the witnesses\u2014Barkstead\u2019s and Hewson\u2019s. The petition from Hewson\u2019s regiment anticipated the role of some of its soldiers in the trial by stating that its members had been \u2018eye and ear witnesses of the last transactions with the grand Enemy\u2019.[CITATION-117] The petition from Barkstead\u2019s regiment clearly painted Charles I as a tyrant, intent on enslaving the people \u2018to his exorbitant will and lust\u2019.[CITATION-118] Blood here was the price that the soldiers had paid for \u2018every mans freedom, right and property\u2019, a sacrifice which had been unconscionably forgotten when the Parliament resolved to re-open negotiations with the king.[CITATION-119] The text also strongly indicated some Leveller sympathies or influence: it complained that the Large Petition had been unfairly slighted, and it followed earlier Leveller works in using the language of blood guilt against Parliament and the army leadership, as well as against Charles, in its demand for an \u2018inquisition\u2019 for the blood of Thomas Rainsborough.[CITATION-120] The idea of making an \u2018inquisition for blood\u2019, of course, was also rooted in the Bible, specifically Psalm 9:12. Yet that text itself, especially in the Geneva Bible translation, could also be read as a call for social justice, resonating with the broader demands of many of these petitions: \u2018For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth it,forgetteth not the complaint of the poor\u2019.[CITATION-121] This rendering of the verse certainly chimed with the powerful ending to the petition from Barkstead\u2019s regiment, which called on Fairfax to consider \u2018the miseries of this bleeding Nation, the bloud of the innocence [], the Outcry of the Widdow, and Fatherlesse, the sad Omen of future troubles\u2019.[CITATION-122] The demands of army petitioners were heard by the court itself and, in this instance, these demands threatened the king\u2019s judges as well as the king. The petitioners for justice in the winter of 1648 have sometimes been portrayed as the cat\u2019s paws of some trial commissioners. Henry Marten was accused of having authored the Large Petition himself.[CITATION-123] Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton were similarly alleged to have orchestrated the petitions from army regiments.[CITATION-124] Yet, while it is certainly true that Cromwell endorsed the petition from Thomas Harrison\u2019s regiment as showing a \u2018very great zeal to have impartial Justice done upon Offenders\u2019, the vast majority of these army petitions made no explicit calls for the king\u2019s execution.[CITATION-125] Moreover, as Norah Carlin has argued and broader work on other petitioning campaigns has suggested, the variety of demands found within these texts indicates that we should view them in the main as the authentic productions of these regiments.[CITATION-126] Work on petitioning more generally has also encouraged us to be attentive to the voice of petitioners communicated through these texts, though they might be mediated by clerks or superiors.[CITATION-127] The court was addressed directly by some army petitioners: on 22 January, as the commissioners sat in private in the Painted Chamber, they received a petition from soldiers in the city, explicitly denouncing the king as \u2018our grand tyrant, Charles Steward\u2019. The petition brought home the ramifications of the Commons\u2019 invocation of popular sovereignty. The petitioners informed the commissioners that, as the court was founded on the sovereignty of the people, it was bound to honour their requests. The court should avenge the innocent blood shed during the civil wars by condemning the king and cut the \u2018bands of wickedness \u2026 letting the oppressed go free, by breaking every heavy yoke\u2019. It urged the commissioners to \u2018put on righteousness as a robe and judgement as a crown, walking in the light and strength of God, fulfilling his will\u2019. Yet it also warned the king\u2019s judges that if they did not execute justice, both they and the petitioners would perish, rather than the \u2018tyrant\u2019 Charles Stuart.[CITATION-128] After hearing the testimony of the final witness, Richard Price, the commissioners resolved to proceed to condemning the king as a tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy to the commonwealth. It was agreed that the condemnation should \u2018extend to death\u2019, though notably the court agreed that their votes on these matters would not be binding.[CITATION-129] The witness depositions may have served to persuade some wavering commissioners to condemn the king. They arguably take on a wider significance when we consider that it was originally intended that they be read in open court. The public nature of the king\u2019s trial has largely been thought of in terms of its propaganda value, but we might consider whether this mass \u2018witnessing\u2019, both within Westminster Hall and beyond through print, was also intended to confirm the court\u2019s judgment. Thinking about witnessing in this broader sense may also require us to re-examine the reporting of the king\u2019s behaviour at the trial. Jason Peacey has argued that both Parliamentarian and Royalist writers identified the value of reflecting on Charles\u2019s speech and deportment.[CITATION-130] As has already been stated, early modern conceptions of tyranny were connected to various \u2018unkingly\u2019 personality traits. For those commissioners seeking to convince the rest of the court and the public at large that the king was a tyrant, printed reports of moments when Charles appeared to lose emotional control\u2014laughing at the word tyrant itself, for example, or tapping Cook with his cane\u2014were also perhaps intended to provide a wider body of witnesses with an insight into his malevolent character.[CITATION-131] Certainly, Lucy Hutchinson would later record that the king\u2019s gestures as much as his speech provided clear evidence of his lack of remorse:One thing was remarked in him by many of the court, that when the blood spilt in many battles where he was in his own person, and had caused it to be shed by his own command, was laid to his charge, he heard it with disdainful smiles, and looks and gestures, which rather expressed sorrow that all the opposite party to him [meaning the commissioners] had not been cut off, than that any were\u2026[CITATION-132] Here we might see newsbook accounts of the trial, for those outside of Westminster Hall, as the political equivalent of the \u2018virtual witnessing\u2019 through print that Steven Shapin has identified as a crucial strategy for validating the discoveries of the \u2018New Science\u2019.[CITATION-133] \u2018Virtual witnessing\u2019 of this kind involved not just passive observation but re-enactment: works of martyrology, for example, required readers to re-experience the suffering of the martyr (and thereby confirm their martyrdom).[CITATION-134] Similarly, authors reflecting on the role of witnesses in modern war crimes trials have emphasised that their testimony is often meant to do more than simply support the prosecution\u2019s case against a specific defendant. Instead, witness statements delivered in the typically very public setting of these trials are intended, in broader terms, to deliver moral as well as legal judgment, encouraging the public to identify with the witnesses\u2019 experience.[CITATION-135] Etymologically, as Giorgio Agamben has noted, witnessing is bound up with both personal experience and the experience of suffering in particular.[CITATION-136] In this way, the depositions of the witnesses against Charles I can be connected with the wealth of stories of suffering from veterans of the civil wars, or accounts offered by their families, which were critical to confirming political identities and, in turn, securing material relief.[CITATION-137] Besides their potential worth in encouraging wider public acceptance of the king\u2019s guilt, the witnesses\u2019 accounts also had polemical value. As is well known, Charles I and his supporters successfully fashioned an image of the king as a martyr for his church and for his people.[CITATION-138] It was an image that the king had developed in the trial, presenting himself as more concerned with securing the peace of the kingdom and the liberty of the subject than with saving his own life.[CITATION-139] The alternative narratives offered through the witnesses\u2019 depositions could have been intended to counterbalance the Royalists\u2019 strategy, replacing the saintly Charles with a bloody and unrepentant murderer, and recasting the English people as the true sufferers in a conflict he had initiated and perpetuated.The Rump clearly considered the witness statements to be politically as well as legally useful. While the witness testimony did not appear in print in English until 1660, an authorised French translation of the trial proceedings, including the depositions, appeared in early 1650:.[CITATION-140] The text was licensed by John Milton in December 1649 and was in print by the spring of 1650.[CITATION-141] Theincluded French translations of all of the witness statements, assuring its readers that their testimony was \u2018tres-veritables\u2019.[CITATION-142] It was intended as a response to Mazarinades which had cannibalised the Commonwealth\u2019s own propaganda to produce pro-Royalist French-language accounts of the trial.[CITATION-143] Attempting to disguise its Parliamentarian provenance, thepresented itself as an objective chronicle of the trial, reporting its events without partiality.[CITATION-144] It concluded, however, by declaring that Charles was accused not only of the crimes alleged in the charge against him but of many other crimes and offences detailed in the Parliament\u2019s declarations.[CITATION-145] The Commonwealth\u2019s attempt to influence French public opinion by stealth, however, was unsuccessful: the ships carrying 1,900 copies of the pamphlet were seized at Rouen.[CITATION-146] In an English context, the Rump had already moved away from attempting to produce authorised accounts of its \u2018state trials\u2019, instead opting for a policy of suppressing their reporting.[CITATION-147] Thedemonstrates, nonetheless, that the Rump had seen value in including the witness statements, both to emphasise the king\u2019s guilt and, perhaps, to undermine the developing image of the royal martyr. The potential power of the witness testimony in this respect is indicated by the handling of the depositions in post-Restoration works. The material contained within the depositions was still sensitive enough that it would be a decade after the publication of thebefore references to the witnesses appeared in English print. The compiler of the Royalist account(1660), which drew upon theas a source, seemingly felt some of the witness testimony was damaging enough that it needed to be entirely omitted, in the case of that from the last three witnesses, or truncated, in the case of Humphrey Browne\u2019s testimony regarding the siege of Leicester.[CITATION-148] Some Royalist broadsheets included the names and biographical details of the witnesses. As one broadsheet,, made clear, however, their intent was to expose these individuals to justice rather than to rehearse their evidence: \u2018If any man or Woman, in City, Town, or Countrey can Discover, or bring Tydings of any of these aforesaid Traytors who are fled away: Let them convey them safe to the Tower of London, and they shall be well rewarded for their Pains\u2019.[CITATION-149] The witness depositions would not appear in full until 1684, in John Nalson\u2019s. Even then, while Nalson chose to reproduce all of the witness testimony, he still felt it necessary to question the credibility of some of the depositions through the addition of critical, marginal commentary.[CITATION-150] Looking again at the role of the witnesses at Charles I\u2019s trial can enrich our understanding of the regicide in a number of ways. The witnesses\u2019 testimony substantiated the charges of treason, tyranny and murder made against the king. This evidence was deemed weighty enough both for the Rump to disseminate it in print to an international audience as part of its propaganda strategy and for Royalist writers immediately after the Restoration to omit it in part or in full from their accounts. The witnesses\u2019 evidence also suggests that we need to think about what the High Court of Justice represented as much as we need to consider the ultimate outcome of its proceedings. This point has been made convincingly in a number of articles by Sean Kelsey in relation to the court as an institutional embodiment of the concept of popular sovereignty.[CITATION-151] Here, it has been argued that the lowly status of some of the witnesses reveals the influence of radical ideas of justice upon the operation of the High Court of Justice. These ideas were tacitly acknowledged by Royalist critics of the court, such as the Earl of Clarendon, whose distant relative, Sir Henry Hyde, was another one of its victims. Clarendon described the High Court as an institution which took away the \u2018distinction of quality\u2019 in capital cases and made \u2018the greatest lord and the meanest peasant undergo the same judicatory and form of trial\u2019.[CITATION-152] As Alexandra Shepard\u2019s work makes clear, contemporaries understood the \u2018worth\u2019 of a witness in relative as well as absolute terms.[CITATION-153] The condemnation of a king on the basis of the evidence of cordwainers, vintners and husbandmen represented a profound challenge to accepted ideas of \u2018worthiness\u2019. The ideas of justice embodied in the trial resonated with Leveller ideas, especially those articulated in the Large Petition. As has been shown, these arguments were endorsed in numerous army petitions, including those from regiments which supplied several of the witnesses against the king.[CITATION-154] These, in turn, were echoed in the Commons\u2019 own declaration, prior to the trial, that its authority, and by extension that of the court it established to try the king, was grounded on the sovereignty of the people.As Feisal G. Mohamed has argued, that declaration was one in which popular sovereignty was \u2018dissolved\u2019 as soon as it appeared: a small \u2018Rump\u2019 of the Commons asserting the right to speak on behalf of the whole English people.[CITATION-155] Nonetheless, the approbation of the people remained important. As originally envisaged, the witness testimony would have invited a wider public, both those within Westminster Hall and those following the proceedings in print, to judge the guilt of the king. Besides their value as legal evidence, then, the witness depositions illuminate the mode of thinking that apparently drove Parliament, in the words reportedly spoken by Thomas Harrison to Charles I, to try the king \u2018in a way of justice, to which the world should be witness\u2019.[CITATION-156] ",
