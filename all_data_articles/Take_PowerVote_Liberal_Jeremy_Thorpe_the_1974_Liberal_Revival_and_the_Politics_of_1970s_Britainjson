This article explores the evolution of Liberal policy, strategy, and support between 1970 and 1979, and argues that Thorpe and his colleagues were agents as well as beneficiaries of electoral dealignment. As long-standing critics of class politics, Liberals were well placed to exploit voters\u2019 frustrations with Edward Heath and Harold Wilson and to articulate demands for a more collaborative and participatory style of government. Thorpe\u2019s populist critique of the two-party system was backed up by a distinctive plan for economic and political renewal, in which social, industrial, and constitutional reforms would give governments the legitimacy to make incomes policies work. These ideas resonated strongly in the two 1974 general elections, but the Liberals\u2019 new-found support was relatively shallow, and Thorpe\u2019s appeal was waning even before the Norman Scott affair forced his 1976 resignation. The 1970s Liberal revival nevertheless laid important political foundations which the SDP/Liberal Alliance would build on after 1981, as it sought to articulate a centrist alternative to Thatcherism.On Monday 2 September 1974, the Liberal Party leader, Jeremy Thorpe, stopped off in a rain-soaked Brighton as part of a pre-election tour of English coastal resorts. Three days earlier, Thorpe\u2019s attempt to appeal to late-summer holidaymakers had descended into farce when his hovercraft ran aground on Sidmouth beach, but at Brighton he offered a sober warning about Britain\u2019s mounting economic difficulties.[CITATION-1] His flamboyant style, he explained to ainterviewer, was designed to draw attention to a \u2018deadly serious\u2019 message: \u2018we are living beyond our means, the Government is borrowing more than it could ever hope to repay, our debts are accumulating to the tune of \u00a34,500 million annually and there is no single panacea which can rescue us\u2019.[CITATION-2] If the coming October election produced another hung Parliament, the Liberals would seek to form a Government of National Unity in order to \u2018save the country from the perils of bankruptcy, poverty and unemployment\u2019. Unless the UK\u2019s democratic leaders took \u2018a grip on its affairs\u2019, Thorpe warned, then \u2018less discerning individuals\u2019 would \u2018have no scruples about using more painful instruments of repression\u2019 to tackle the nation\u2019s problems.[CITATION-3] The 1970s is widely remembered as a turning point in post-war British history: a period when inflation and trade union militancy led to a crisis of confidence in the post-war settlement and helped open the door for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s election victory in 1979. Political narratives of the decade have tended to be structured around a series of failures of governance\u2014the 1973\u20134 energy crisis, the 1976 International Monetary Fund (IMF) application, and the 1978\u20139 \u2018Winter of Discontent\u2019\u2014from which the Thatcher government\u2019s monetarist experiment offered a divisive but politically successful way out.[CITATION-4] As historians such as Lawrence Black and Hugh Pemberton have pointed out, however, the prevailing view of the 1970s as a \u2018benighted decade\u2019 is itself a politically constructed one, which risks obscuring more complex patterns of social and cultural change and foreclosing the possibility of different outcomes.[CITATION-5] On the one hand, electoral dealignment and fears of \u2018the break-up of Britain\u2019 can be seen as symptoms of a larger cultural shift in which class-based identities and established social institutions were disrupted by the decline of \u2018deference\u2019 and the rise of \u2018popular individualism\u2019.[CITATION-6] On the other hand, we also need to pay close attention to the complex temporalities of the decade and the political contingencies involved in the coming of Thatcherism.Recent accounts of the construction of \u2018crisis\u2019 in 1970s Britain have largely focused on Conservative politicians and their supporters in the press\u2014as, for instance, in Camilla Schofield\u2019s study of Enoch Powell, Robert Saunders\u2019s work on Margaret Thatcher, and Colin Hay\u2019s influential analysis of the \u2018Winter of Discontent\u2019.[CITATION-7] As Jim Tomlinson has noted, however, \u2018declinism\u2019 was by no means confined to the political right, but \u2018became the common currency of British politics in the 1970s\u2019.[CITATION-8] As Conservative and Labour governments struggled to respond to the UK\u2019s economic challenges, Liberals, Marxist radicals, and Scottish and Welsh nationalists all gained political traction and played an important role in fostering a sense of political dislocation.[CITATION-9] Thorpe\u2019s Brighton speech shows that even Liberal politicians sometimes couched their appeal in an apocalyptic register.The re-emergence of the Liberal Party as a significant electoral force was one of the most important political developments in 1970s Britain. In the general election of February 1974, the Liberals won more than six million votes (19.3 per cent of the total) and helped remove Edward Heath\u2019s government from office; in October 1974 they ran 619 candidates, took 18.3 per cent of the vote, and confirmed their renewed political relevance. Though the party struggled to convert these votes into parliamentary seats, returning fourteen MPs in February and thirteen in October, the tight results produced by the two elections gave the small band of Liberals significant weight in the House of Commons.[CITATION-10] Between March 1977 and July 1978, Thorpe\u2019s successor David Steel and his colleagues sustained Jim Callaghan\u2019s government in power through the \u2018Lib\u2013Lab Pact\u2019\u2014the first such formal inter-party agreement since the Second World War.[CITATION-11] Even as Liberal support declined during the late 1970s, the party remained a significant factor in Labour and Conservative calculations. Indeed, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s success in winning over between one-quarter and two-fifths of October 1974 Liberal voters was one of the foundations of her 1979 election victory.[CITATION-12] To date, however, the Thorpe-era Liberal revival has received surprisingly little attention from historians. The only full-length study of the party in the 1970s\u2014a 1999 Ph.D. thesis by Ruth Fox\u2014remains unpublished, and other analysis is largely confined to biographies (such as Michael Bloch\u2019s life of Thorpe), general surveys of the party\u2019s history and political thought (such as Tudor Jones\u2019s study of(2011)), and specialist articles in the.[CITATION-13] One possible reason for this neglect is that contemporary political scientists tended to see the upsurge in Liberal support largely as a protest vote. If Disraeli\u2019s working-class Conservatives were \u2018angels in marble\u2019, then 1974 Liberal voters were \u2018angels in plastic\u2019, drawn to the party by disillusionment with Heath and by Thorpe\u2019s charismatic image rather than any deeper Liberal commitment.[CITATION-14] A second problem is that the Liberals fell short of their stated goals of \u2018realignment\u2019 and electoral reform, both during the 1970s and in the subsequent Alliance with the Social Democratic Party (1981\u20138). As a result, the party\u2019s electoral gains under Thorpe and Steel have been overshadowed by a sense of ultimate strategic failure.[CITATION-15] Perceptions of Thorpe\u2019s leadership have also, understandably, been coloured by the Norman Scott affair, which culminated in his resignation in 1976 and trial in 1979 on the charge of conspiracy to murder. Posthumous allegations of child sexual abuse against the Liberal MPs Cyril Smith and Clement Freud have further damaged the party\u2019s reputation. The stench of scandal here is strong\u2014indeed, nauseating. Although most Liberals seem to have known little or nothing about these activities until they became public knowledge,published a report about Smith\u2019s conduct as early as 1979, and the recent Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) has strongly criticised David Steel for failing to launch a full investigation.[CITATION-16] The IICSA report raises troubling questions about the party\u2019s internal culture and procedures during the 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, these issues are not the focus of the present work, which looks instead at the party\u2019s public face. After all, the dark underbelly of the 1970s Liberal Party can only be properly understood against the backdrop of the party\u2019s political appeal, campaigns, and objectives.This article therefore re-examines the 1970s Liberal revival in order to establish the nature and significance of the party\u2019s breakthrough in 1974. In particular, it seeks to move beyond a personalised focus on Thorpe to explore how the party as a whole navigated the shifting social, economic and cultural landscape of 1970s Britain, and to see the party not as a passive beneficiary of \u2018dealignment\u2019 but as an active political agent. As Camilla Schofield has argued, \u2018the decline of class\u2019 was mediated by language and political argument, and thus, \u2018at least to some extent, arather thantransformation\u2019.[CITATION-17] As long-standing critics of \u2018class politics\u2019, Liberals were well placed to give voice to voters\u2019 frustration with both Conservative and Labour governments, and to tap into the \u2018growing desire to emphasize individuality, authenticity, and ordinariness\u2019 which Florence Sutcliffe-Braithwaite has identified in vernacular culture during this period.[CITATION-18] Younger voters seem to have been particularly attracted by the Liberals, perhaps because of Thorpe\u2019s forthright embrace of progressive causes from Europe and immigrants\u2019 rights to racial and sexual equality. At its peak, however, the party\u2019s critique of \u2018adversary politics\u2019 resonated well beyond the ranks of young idealists and metropolitan intellectuals. Under Thorpe, the Liberals pitched their appeal not only at \u2018People Who Think For Themselves\u2019 (as Jo Grimond\u2019s posters had put it in 1964) but at a broad swathe of disillusioned voters, framing a Liberal vote as an opportunity to \u2018Take Power\u2019 and \u2018Change the Face of Britain\u2019. The Liberals\u2019 strong performance in the two elections of 1974 reminds us that feelings of \u2018powerlessness\u2019 and alienation from governing elites were politically mutable, and could be given shape by liberal as well as conservative forms of populism.The article develops this argument in six main steps. The first section sets the scene by placing the Liberal Party in the wider social and political context of early 1970s Britain, including the cultural tensions brought to the fore by Enoch Powell\u2019s \u2018Rivers of Blood\u2019 speech, and examines how younger activists sought to revive Liberal fortunes after the disastrous 1970 election through campaign-oriented \u2018community politics\u2019. A second section unpacks the Liberal response to the economic challenges which Britain faced during the Heath years, and argues that the party\u2019s 1974 campaigns were rooted in a coherent (if somewhat technocratic) vision of a reconstructed post-war settlement. The third and fourth sections trace the revival of the party\u2019s electoral fortunes from the by-election victories of 1972\u20133 to the general elections of February and October 1974. The fifth section explores how core elements of the Liberal agenda\u2014particularly interest in electoral reform and \u2018national unity\u2019\u2014continued to shape political debate into the later 1970s, but were ultimately squeezed out by the more assertive \u2018conviction politics\u2019 of Mrs Thatcher. Finally, the conclusion reflects on the wider implications of the Liberal revival for our understanding of post-war British politics.The Liberal Party began the 1970s in a parlous state. In the election of June 1970\u2014Thorpe\u2019s first as leader\u2014the party lost six of the twelve seats which it had won four years earlier, and Thorpe himself only clung on in North Devon by 369 votes. If the landslide Labour victory in 1966 had dashed Jo Grimond\u2019s hopes of a \u2018realignment of the left\u2019, the unpopularity of Harold Wilson\u2019s government in the final years of the decade left the Liberals adrift, caught out by a rising tide of conservatism. Thorpe spent much of the 1970 campaign accusing Edward Heath of moving \u2018further and further to the right\u2019 under pressure from Enoch Powell, whom he described as \u2018stark staring bonkers\u2019, but the Tory victory suggested that many voters were unperturbed.[CITATION-19] Eric Lubbock\u2019s defeat at Orpington, which he had won in a famous by-election in 1962, set the seal on the Liberal reverse. \u2018[A]fter a decade of struggle to break back into the mainstream of British political life\u2019, Peter Fiddick noted in, the Liberals had been reduced to \u2018a tiny rump\u2019 and were \u2018once more the party of the Celtic fringe\u2019.[CITATION-20] agreed, and predicted that if the Heath government performed even \u2018reasonably well\u2019 there was \u2018no likelihood of the Liberals being able to make any impact\u2019 in the coming Parliament.[CITATION-21] The Liberals\u2019 poor performance in 1970 partly stemmed from the weakness of Thorpe\u2019s campaign\u2014Peter Hain, then a leading Young Liberal activist, thought the manifesto was \u2018shoddy, incoherent, and totally negative\u2019\u2014but it also reflected the party\u2019s traditional vulnerability to a Conservative recovery in rural and suburban areas.[CITATION-22] In the economic sphere, the Liberals had shared fully in the \u2018growthmanship\u2019 of the early 1960s, which came to seem increasingly na\u00efve during the second half of the decade; in the social and cultural sphere, the party was associated with the \u2018permissive\u2019 agenda, most notably through David Steel\u2019s role in introducing the 1967 Abortion Act and Thorpe\u2019s vocal support for Commonwealth immigration.[CITATION-23] As the Cambridge historian John Vincent had warned when Thorpe became leader, these progressive views sat uncomfortably with prevailing cultural norms in some of the \u2018up-country\u2019 seats which Liberal MPs represented.[CITATION-24] Richard Wainwright blamed Tory campaigning on crime and immigration for his defeat in Colne Valley, and some members of the party\u2019s national executive felt that \u2018Liberals\u2019 association with \u2026 so-called \u201cpermissive society\u201d measures\u2019 had become an electoral liability.[CITATION-25] The challenges posed by the cultural politics of the late 1960s were amplified by two areas in which the Liberals had shown signs of growth during the early years of Thorpe\u2019s leadership. Firstly, the Young Liberal Movement (YLs) had boomed as a result of an influx of left-leaning students who were attracted by Thorpe\u2019s attacks on apartheid and angered by the Wilson government\u2019s equivocations over the Vietnam War.[CITATION-26] Attempts to commit the party to an anti-NATO stance at its 1966 Assembly led the media to label YL activists as \u2018Red Guards\u2019, and the leading role which Hain and other YLs played in the Stop the Seventy Tour campaign against the white South African cricket team kept the movement in the limelight in the run-up to the 1970 election. Some older Liberals, such as Arthur Slack of the National Union of Liberal Clubs, blamed the YLs for the party\u2019s losses in 1970, and matters came to a head later in the year when the former YL chairman Louis Eaks was widely accused of stoking antisemitism.[CITATION-27] Thorpe responded by commissioning Stephen Terrell QC to lead a controversial and largely fruitless inquiry into the YLs and their relationship with the wider party.[CITATION-28] A second area of Liberal growth lay in the party\u2019s efforts to expand its local government presence from small towns and seaside resorts to inner-city areas, especially those where Labour\u2019s political organisation had decayed through neglect, industrial decline, or unpopular rehousing schemes.[CITATION-29] The most striking example of this progress came in Birmingham, where Wallace Lawler won Newtown ward in 1962, turned it into a political base, and then gained Birmingham Ladywood from Labour in a 1969 parliamentary by-election.[CITATION-30] Lawler, a plastics manufacturer, described himself as \u2018an unofficial Ombudsman for the whole of the city\u2019 and built up his profile through populist campaigns\u2014for instance, by taking a thousand Birmingham pensioners to Downing Street to protest against rising electricity charges.[CITATION-31] Yet this \u2018rebirth of working-class Liberalism\u2019\u2014as Brian Priestley of theput it\u2014came with a sting in the tail, as Lawler broke from the party\u2019s liberal line on immigration to complain about \u2018ugly problems\u2019 of overcrowding and venereal disease among immigrant groups, and called for labour permits in Birmingham to be restricted until these problems were solved.[CITATION-32] Lawler\u2019s flirtation with nativism was by no means typical of Liberal councillors, but a 1971 row over a traveller site in Barnsley suggested that it was not an isolated case.[CITATION-33] At a time of widespread anxieties over race and cultural change, a populist commitment to local representation could easily undercut the party\u2019s efforts to position itself as the champion of other liberal principles.Despite its small size, then, Thorpe\u2019s party found itself straddling the social and cultural divides which fractured late 1960s Britain, as MPs representing far-flung rural seats rubbed up against student radicals, middle-class professionals and inner-city activists.[CITATION-34] What held these groups together was a shared desire to keep the Liberal Party alive as an independent force. Indeed, the near-death experience of 1970 galvanised new efforts at co-ordination. Perhaps most importantly, some of the more pragmatic Young Liberals\u2014led by the new YL chairman Tony Greaves and vice-chairman Gordon Lishman\u2014began to throw their energies into local activism, and drew on New Left ideas about direct action and \u2018maximum feasible participation\u2019 in order to flesh out a liberal theory of \u2018community politics\u2019.[CITATION-35] At the 1970 Assembly in Eastbourne, Greaves and Lishman successfully amended a resolution on \u2018Party Strategy and Tactics\u2019 to commit the Liberals to \u2018a dual approach to politics, acting both inside and outside the institutions of the political establishment \u2026 to help organize people in communities to take and use power; to use our political skills to redress grievances; and to represent people at all levels of the political structure\u2019. The national party would support the effort to build \u2018a Liberal power base in the major cities of this country\u2019 by taking \u2018an aggressive political lead on issues of moral concern, injustice and oppression\u2019, identifying the Liberals with \u2018the underprivileged of this country and the world\u2019 and using these campaigns \u2018to publicise Liberal attitudes and policies\u2019. In due course, this strategy would prepare the party to fight the next general election \u2018on the broadest possible front\u2019.[CITATION-36] The community politics strategy which emerged during the early 1970s opened up common ground between New Left-influenced YLs and urban councillors, and helped shift the focus of the party\u2019s activities from Parliament to local government and the regions. Lishman wrote a \u2018community politics guide\u2019 for circulation to local parties, and the party set out to target major gains in the 1973 local elections, when voters in England and Wales would elect members of the new county and district councils created by the 1972 Local Government Act.[CITATION-37] Though Thorpe and other MPs treated the Eastbourne strategy with caution, Richard Wainwright\u2014who had become chairman of the national executive after losing his Colne Valley seat\u2014began to reshape the party\u2019s policy and organisation to support extra-parliamentary campaigning. For instance, during the winter of 1971\u20132 Wainwright launched an \u2018Action on Hardship\u2019 campaign to highlight the party\u2019s concern for low-paid workers, while the YLs ran a campaign on the \u2018Urban Crisis\u2019 which called for a new participatory approach to housing and planning.[CITATION-38] Wainwright hoped to use these campaigns to build links with the \u2018poverty lobby\u2019 groups which had emerged in response to the \u2018rediscovery of poverty\u2019 during the 1960s, such as Shelter and the Child Poverty Action Group.[CITATION-39] The initial response from the voluntary sector was \u2018not \u2026 very favourable\u2019, but the campaigns seem to have helped re-engage some wavering party members.[CITATION-40] David Steel also persuaded Shelter\u2019s founding director Des Wilson to join the party in order to stand as the Liberal candidate for Hove in a 1973 by-election.[CITATION-41] High-intensity \u2018pavement politics\u2019 yielded its biggest dividends in Liverpool, where Cyril Carr and Trevor Jones usedleaflets and \u2018grumble sheets\u2019 to exploit voters\u2019 frustration with poor housing conditions and other council services. Decades of often sectarian \u2018boss politics\u2019 provided an ideal foil for Liberal activism, and the Liberal group grew from four councillors in 1970 to forty-six in 1973, when the party supplanted Labour to form a minority administration.[CITATION-42] Greaves, a geography teacher at Colne Grammar School, put similar techniques into practice in his home borough of Pendle, where the Liberals also became the largest party.[CITATION-43] Across the country as a whole, the 1973 elections saw more than 1,400 Liberal councillors elected, about 6 per cent of the total, as the party took control of Eastbourne and held the balance of power in several other boroughs, including Leeds and Bury.[CITATION-44] By this point, the national political mood was also turning strongly in the Liberals\u2019 favour.The Liberals\u2019 experiments in community politics took place against the backdrop of the Heath government\u2019s efforts to achieve a \u2018quiet revolution\u2019 in the British economy by cutting taxes, taming trade union power, and unleashing the dynamism of the private sector.[CITATION-45] Heath\u2019s concern about the political impact of rising unemployment in 1971\u20132 prompted his famous \u2018u-turn\u2019 towards reflation, with the \u2018Barber boom\u2019 accompanied by a statutory incomes policy and repeated efforts to reach a bargain with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Trades Union Congress (TUC). Keith Middlemas has characterised 1972\u20134 as the last and boldest attempt to reverse the UK\u2019s relative economic decline through corporatist co-operation: \u2018a strategic attempt to rethink the nature of \u2026 the postwar settlement\u2019 which was undermined by bitter rows over the government\u2019s Industrial Relations Act, housing finance reforms and regressive tax policies.[CITATION-46] The OPEC oil embargo and Heath\u2019s confrontation with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) brought matters to a head in the winter of 1973\u20134; indeed, the economist Michael Stewart thought this period \u2018saw the opening up of class divides and the emergence of social antagonisms on a scale probably not witnessed since the General Strike half a century before\u2019.[CITATION-47] Heath\u2019s unpopularity and perceived divisiveness created new opportunities for the Liberals. If the role of the state in a modern economy was to hold the ring between capital and labour, as Heath\u2019s rhetoric increasingly suggested, then the Liberals could reasonably question whether either Labour or the Conservatives were sufficiently independent to define and represent the national interest.[CITATION-48] At the same time, the party\u2019s efforts to reassert its relevance were also aided by the divisions which had opened up in the Labour Party in 1971\u20132, when Roy Jenkins and sixty-eight other MPs defied a three-line whip to vote in favour of entry to the European Economic Community (EEC). Thorpe contrasted the Liberals\u2019 consistent support for Europe with Harold Wilson\u2019s equivocations on the issue, and floated the prospect of drawing Jenkinsites and moderate Tories into a \u2018coalition of the centre\u2019.[CITATION-49] thought that the idea of the Liberals as \u2018the nucleus of a powerful, moderate party\u2019 was a chimera, but William Rees-Mogg ofwas more receptive to the idea, and commissioned a poll in September 1972 which suggested that 35 per cent of voters would support an alliance between the Liberals and Labour moderates.[CITATION-50] (Perhaps more strikingly, 53 per cent agreed that \u2018The present party political system no longer works properly\u2019, and 40 per cent supported the proposition that \u2018If there was a chance of the Liberal Party getting into power, I would vote for them\u2019.) Though Jenkins and his supporters rebuffed the idea, discussions of realignment were kept alive by Dick Taverne\u2019s resignation as a Labour MP after a row with left-wing activists in Lincoln, and his triumphant victory as a \u2018Democratic Labour\u2019 candidate in the resulting March 1973 by-election.[CITATION-51] Since the 1920s, the Conservatives had generally sought to squeeze the Liberals out of British politics in order to monopolise the non-Labour vote; during 1972\u20133, some Tories and right-leaning journalists seem to have switched to talking up the Liberals as a way of encouraging a split in the Labour Party.[CITATION-52] Thorpe\u2019s approach to Liberal leadership was very different to the reflective, policy-oriented style of his predecessor Jo Grimond. Where Grimond had given the party \u2018credibility\u2019, Thorpe toldin September 1973, \u2018my task has been to try to give itcredibility, to prove that it can succeed, that it can win seats, that it can put people into the House of Commons who can do something\u2019.[CITATION-53] As the Bodmin MP Peter Bessell observed, Thorpe was fascinated by organisation and electioneering rather than ideas, and his firm liberal convictions on issues such as decolonisation and civil liberties coexisted with a rather woolly centrism on economic and social policy.[CITATION-54] Given how little attention most voters paid to Liberal policy, such vagueness was not necessarily a disadvantage; indeed, some of the party\u2019s campaign planners thought its \u2018most effective appeal\u2019 was to tap into \u2018the average voter\u2019s natural inclination for real change\u2019 by emphasising that \u2018Liberals can win and are winning\u2019.[CITATION-55] Nevertheless, the party clearly needed to back up its slogans with some policy detail if it was to mount a serious bid for office. Much of this work was undertaken by Wainwright, the Treasury spokesman John Pardoe, the party\u2019s research director Tony Richards, and the former party president Desmond Banks, who took on the newly created voluntary role of \u2018director of policy promotion\u2019.[CITATION-56] The policy package that emerged in 1972\u20133 drew heavily on proposals which had been developed under Grimond a decade earlier, but took on new relevance in a context of growing industrial tension. The party\u2019s economic analysis placed it firmly in the \u2018Keynesian-plus\u2019 mainstream, with the rise in unemployment during 1971 attributed to weak demand and the rising inflation of 1972\u20133 seen primarily as a \u2018cost-push\u2019 phenomenon.[CITATION-57] This focus on wages and prices led the Liberals to offer broad support for the incomes policies imposed by the Wilson and Heath governments, though they frequently criticised the details.[CITATION-58] Working with the industrial relations specialist Michael Fogarty, whose vision of the \u2018just wage\u2019 was strongly influenced by Catholic social teaching, Pardoe argued that the government should use punitive levies on corporation tax and National Insurance contributions to penalise excessive wage and price increases.[CITATION-59] The fundamental problem with Heath\u2019s incomes policy, however, was neither structure nor enforcement but a lack of consent, since the Conservatives had explicitly rejected \u2018the philosophy of compulsory wage control\u2019 in their 1970 manifesto. What was needed (the Liberals argued) was a clear electoral mandate for statutory controls, instead of an endless series of improvised short-term measures.[CITATION-60] Many contemporary commentators interpreted the wage inflation and union militancy of the late 1960s and 1970s in sociological terms. John Goldthorpe, for instance, thought that the rise of the welfare state and the decline of traditional social norms had made younger workers more sensitive to distributional inequalities, and the economist Ralph Turvey believed that \u2018strong feelings of social injustice\u2019 had contributed to the post-1969 \u2018wage explosion\u2019.[CITATION-61] In this political climate, the Heath government\u2019s ability to impose wage restraint appeared to be severely compromised by the Conservative Party\u2019s close relationship with business and the large tax cuts it had given to shareholders and high earners.[CITATION-62] By contrast, the Liberals argued that three sets of radical reforms could ensure that a permanent incomes policy was seen as \u2018fair\u2019.Firstly, the Liberals set out plans for a vigorous assault on poverty through wage regulation and social security changes. A Liberal government would introduce a statutory minimum wage set at two-thirds of average industrial earnings (\u00a324 per week in 1973), raise old age pensions to half average earnings for a married couple, and introduce a \u2018credit income tax\u2019 scheme to provide a minimum income floor for the whole population. Like Labour, the Liberals spoke the language of \u2018social justice\u2019; unlike Labour, the party was less concerned about unionised workers than those whom Thorpe called the \u2018forgotten minorities\u2019\u2014the farm workers, \u2018public servants, pensioners, and other social security beneficiaries\u2019 who lacked the bargaining power to keep pace with rising prices.[CITATION-63] Wainwright and Thorpe used the \u2018Action on Hardship\u2019 campaign to publicise this agenda\u2014for instance, by drawing attention to low pay among lace workers in Nottingham and Securicor security staff in Kent.[CITATION-64] During the election of February 1974 the party went even further by promising to \u2018freeze all rents for at least a year\u2019 in order to help maintain living standards.[CITATION-65] Significantly, the February 1974 manifesto also linked the case for redistribution to the longer-term environmental crisis which had been highlighted by thinkers such as E.F. Schumacher. Since the world\u2019s resources were \u2018limited\u2019 and the UK would need to transition to \u2018an age of stability\u2019 with \u2018controlled economic growth\u2019, it was all the more important to limit \u2018private consumption by the few in favour of better public services for the majority of our citizens\u2019.[CITATION-66] Secondly, the Liberals promised to transform the relationship between workers and employers by making radical changes to corporate structure. Under the label of \u2018co-partnership\u2019, the party proposed to create Works Councils in firms with more than twenty employees, to require firms with more than fifty employees to introduce profit-sharing schemes, and to give employees half the votes (alongside shareholders) in the election of \u2018supervisory boards\u2019. These proposals drew on a longer history of Liberal thinking about partnership which dated back at least as far as David Lloyd George\u2019s \u2018Yellow Book\u2019 on(1928) and had been fleshed out in the 1960s by Peter McGregor, a manager at the engineering firm Ferranti. During 1973, Liberal MPs introduced private members\u2019 bills on the subject in an attempt to capture public attention, and Thorpe claimed that co-partnership would create \u2018a totally new climate in industry\u2019, which would help to solve the UK\u2019s economic problems.[CITATION-67] As Stuart White has pointed out, the Liberals\u2019 plans implied a sharp break with the traditional conception of the capitalist firm, placing significant constraints on managerial autonomy and the pursuit of shareholder value. At the same time, they also attempted to empower workers as individuals, in contrast to the Labour left\u2019s trade union-orientated vision of industrial democracy.[CITATION-68] Thirdly, the Liberals reframed their long-standing commitment to constitutional reform as a response to the new political moment. Proportional representation (PR) remained the party\u2019s main demand, but Thorpe and his colleagues now justified it not only on grounds of fairness but also as a way of restoring the effectiveness and legitimacy of the UK political system. Electoral reform would end the abrupt swings of the pendulum which had destabilised British economic policy since 1964 and encourage a more consensual and \u2018European\u2019 style of government. In line with the principles of community politics, the Liberals also called for a radical devolution of power from Westminster and Whitehall: first to elected parliaments or assemblies in Scotland, Wales, and the English regions, then to local authorities, and finally to neighbourhood councils, which\u2014unlike the districts created by the 1972 Local Government Act\u2014would be small enough to allow for meaningful participation.[CITATION-69] The defence of local particularity against the centralising tendencies of the British state had been a hallmark of Liberal politics since the Second World War, but the 1970s reaction against \u2018bureaucracy\u2019 and \u2018bigness\u2019 gave it broader resonance. Lord Crowther-Hunt and Alan Peacock echoed the Liberal diagnosis in their memorandum of dissent to the 1973 Kilbrandon Report on the Constitution, arguing that sweeping decentralisation was necessary to deal with a \u2018pervading sense of powerlessness\u2019 and \u2018indications of a growing alienation from the governmental system\u2019.[CITATION-70] As the Liberal activist Hannan Rose noted in, the party found, \u2018perhaps to its own surprise\u2019, that \u2018some of its old, well-worn and well-loved tunes\u2019 had finally begun to attract public attention.[CITATION-71] Taken together, these policies added up to an ambitious programme for reconstructing the post-war settlement on new foundations. The Liberal agenda reflected the institutionalist tendencies of British social thought in the 1960s and 1970s, which (in different ways) had shaped both Wilson and Heath\u2019s attempts at \u2018modernisation\u2019.[CITATION-72] There were also links with the \u2018reconstructionist\u2019 ideas of progressive business leaders such as George Goyder and Wilfred Brown\u2014who sought to defuse industrial conflict by restructuring the capitalist firm and placing it within a new social architecture\u2014and with the emerging environmentalist movement.[CITATION-73] Yet the political meaning of this agenda was fundamentally ambiguous. On one level, the 1974 Liberal manifestos came as close as the party had probably ever done to challenging the assumptions of market economics in the name of social justice, building on the communitarianism of the Edwardian New Liberals and the interventionism of \u2018centrist-liberal\u2019 economists such as Keynes and Beveridge.[CITATION-74] At the same time, the party\u2019s interest in redistribution, co-partnership and political reform could also be seen as a way of bolstering the legitimacy of the state and strengthening its ability to face down the unions. If many Liberal activists saw their party through the former lens, some of its sympathisers in the press\u2014such as Rees-Mogg and Bernard Levin in\u2014appear to have been more interested in the latter.[CITATION-75] The upturn in the Liberals\u2019 electoral support was sudden and unexpected. As late as February 1972,saw \u2018no sign of another revival\u2019: the party\u2019s poll ratings had languished in the single digits since the 1970 election, and it had fought only five out of twelve by-elections, losing its deposit in four of them.[CITATION-76] Thorpe\u2019s own performance had been lacklustre since his first wife Caroline died in a tragic post-election car crash, and it was only when the European Communities Bill came to the Commons in early 1972 that he really returned to form.[CITATION-77] Then, as Heath imposed a wage freeze and Labour\u2019s divisions widened, the Liberal by-election bandwagon started rolling. In October 1972, Cyril Smith gained Rochdale from Labour on the basis of a populist local campaign; in December, Graham Tope won the safe Conservative seat of Sutton and Cheam on a 33 per cent swing; and during 1973 the Liberals took the Isle of Ely, Ripon, and Berwick-upon-Tweed from the Tories. This gave them five by-election gains in just over a year, along with three very respectable second places.As Richard Jay has pointed out, the Liberals were \u2018lucky in both the timing and the location of the by-elections\u2019, which allowed them to harness the votes of disillusioned Conservatives just as they had done at Orpington in the early 1960s.[CITATION-78] What was new, however, was the party\u2019s ability to make progress in constituencies where it had no tradition of success and very little local organisation, such as the Labour-held seats of Chester-le-Street and Manchester Exchange, where it came a strong second. In some cases this reflected intensive campaign techniques (pioneered by the Liverpool councillor Trevor Jones and deployed to great effect at Sutton and Cheam) and the personal appeal of strong local candidates, but it also suggested a growing openness to the party\u2019s national message, particularly as class-based loyalties started to wither. The political scientist Michael Steed, who stood as the Liberal candidate at Manchester Exchange, thought that \u2018the key to the mood of the electorate was \u201cthe feeling of utter powerlessness\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-79] Though many male manual workers in the constituency were still Labour partisans, their wives seemed more receptive to Steed\u2019s campaign, not least because of dissatisfaction with the Labour-run city council over housing conditions.[CITATION-80] Peter Hain also detected \u2018a growing feeling of rootlessness\u2019, which went hand in hand with \u2018a deep antipathy towards modern, centralised Party machines\u2019.[CITATION-81] After jumping in the opinion polls during summer 1973 and peaking at 29 per cent with National Opinion Polls (NOP) on 13 October, Liberal support drifted downwards as the winter closed in and the miners\u2019 dispute took hold.[CITATION-82] Some Liberals feared that they would be squeezed out in a \u2018crisis election\u2019; instead, Heath\u2019s decision to call an early poll on the question of \u2018Who governs?\u2019 played straight into the party\u2019s hands.[CITATION-83] The row between the Conservative government and the NUM and the resulting \u2018three-day week\u2019 powerfully dramatised the Liberal claim that adversarial politics had brought the country to a standstill, allowing Thorpe to pose as an honest broker who would \u2018unite the centre\u2019 and \u2018isolate the extremists on the right and left in the national interest\u2019.[CITATION-84] \u2018If we can offer to bring peace to Industry\u2019, he told candidates at the beginning of the three-week campaign, \u2018I believe that Liberals will gain massive support at the Polls\u2019.[CITATION-85] The Liberal campaign for the February election was \u2018patched together very hurriedly in January\u2019, but the momentum which the party had gained over the previous year meant that it fielded more than 500 candidates for the first time since the Second World War, allowing Thorpe to declare that \u2018If you want a Liberal Government you can have one\u2019.[CITATION-86] Thorpe himself spent most of the election in Barnstaple and appeared at press conferences via a specially installed video link, which helped to accentuate his detachment from the verbal dogfight between Heath and Wilson.[CITATION-87] The Liberals also benefited from a relatively generous allocation of party political broadcasts (divided between the parties in a ratio of 5:5:3) and increased television news coverage once the short campaign began: the party \u2018almost doubled its share of news coverage\u2019 compared with 1970, and Thorpe \u2018made skilled use of the nightly opportunity to present a fresh and constructive image\u2019.[CITATION-88] Finally, the party spent over \u00a325,000 on a series of press advertisements and \u2018Take Power\u2019 posters, orchestrated by the advertising executive and Liberal candidate Adrian Slade.[CITATION-89] This campaign was made possible by Thorpe\u2019s success in raising donations from businessmen such as Jack Hayward, many of which he handled directly (or through secretive \u2018direct aid accounts\u2019) and some of which he was later alleged to have misappropriated.[CITATION-90] On polling day, Liberal candidates took 19.3 per cent of the national vote\u2014more than double their 1970 performance\u2014and an average of 24 per cent in the 452 seats they contested in England.[CITATION-91] (The Liberals performed less well in Scotland, and to a lesser extent Wales, where the Conservative vote was more resilient and the nationalist parties offered an alternative vehicle of protest.) The broad geographical spread of Liberal support, however, meant that the party won only fourteen seats: holding three of the five by-election gains, retaking Colne Valley and Bodmin (which had been lost in 1970), and adding the Isle of Wight, Hazel Grove, and Cardigan. Data from the British Election Study (BES) suggests that almost half of the new Liberal voters had not voted in 1970, and that the rest were drawn fairly evenly from Labour and the Conservatives; however, some of the Labour-to-Liberal switchers may have been tactically motivated, since most of the Liberals\u2019 strongest performances (including more than four-fifths of their 146 second places) came in Tory constituencies.[CITATION-92] In particular, the Liberals established themselves as the main challengers to the Conservatives across a broad swathe of southern England, coming second in sixty-eight out of 105 Tory-held seats south of the Thames, and made particularly big strides in London suburbs and commuter seats such as Richmond, Twickenham, and Guildford.[CITATION-93] By contrast, the Liberal results bore little relationship to local government activity, perhaps because the dark February nights were not well suited to pavement politics. Indeed, Liverpool Wavertree\u2014where the incoming council leader Cyril Carr was the Liberal candidate\u2014was one of only two English seats where the Liberal vote share went down.[CITATION-94] Who were the six million Liberal voters? Analysis of the BES and other opinion surveys suggests four main patterns. Firstly, Liberal voters were disproportionately young: for instance, the BES found that 27 per cent of under-25s and 23 per cent of 25- to 34- year-olds supported the Liberals, falling to 10 per cent among those aged 75 and over.[CITATION-95] The Conservative Party\u2019s private polling of 16\u201328 year olds also highlighted \u2018[t]he disruptive effect of the Liberals on the political loyalties of the young\u2019, and suggested that young women and those with \u2018more and higher educational qualifications than the age group as a whole\u2019 were particularly likely to switch to Thorpe\u2019s party.[CITATION-96] Secondly, as in the 1960s, the Liberals did better among the \u2018salariat\u2019 and other white-collar groups than among manual workers.[CITATION-97] Thirdly, Liberal voters gave Thorpe high leadership ratings, particularly compared to Heath, whose battle with the NUM had made him seem both combative and ineffectual. Unlike Heath and Wilson, Thorpe\u2019s ratings ran well ahead of his party\u2019s, supporting the widespread view that his television appearances had been an important asset.[CITATION-98] Fourthly, Liberal voters tended to be less satisfied with the British political system than Labour or Conservative supporters.[CITATION-99] It is difficult to draw broader conclusions about political attitudes, since the February BES survey was relatively short (and therefore light on policy questions), but the October survey suggested that Liberal voters were disproportionately likely to believe that both \u2018big business\u2019 and trade unions had too much power, and held broadly but not overwhelmingly liberal views on issues such as race and women\u2019s equality.[CITATION-100] Thorpe discouraged talk of coalitions during the February 1974 campaign, but assured voters that he was prepared to work with other parties if the election produced a hung Parliament.[CITATION-101] When the results came in, with both Labour (on 301 seats) and the Conservatives (on 297 seats) well short of a majority, he had to deliver on this promise. Heath offered him a coalition, including a seat in the Cabinet, plus a Speaker\u2019s Conference on electoral reform; but though Thorpe seems to have been attracted to the idea, Liberal candidates and activists deluged party headquarters with objections. Not only would a Conservative\u2013Liberal coalition have lacked a majority of seats (and so required support from at least one other party, probably the Ulster Unionists), but most Liberals believed the party\u2019s success was largely the result of Heath\u2019s unpopularity. The fourteen Liberal MPs thus rejected Heath\u2019s offer and called instead for an all-party Government of National Unity to carry out an agreed short-term economic programme. Since neither of the main parties was interested in repeating the events of 1931, Heath resigned and allowed Wilson to form a minority administration.[CITATION-102] A new election was widely expected within months, and the most optimistic Liberals hoped that \u2018one more heave\u2019 would bring the party to power, though the Labour government\u2019s honeymoon period made this task much harder. By ending the miners\u2019 dispute, repealing the Industrial Relations Act, and taking action on rents and food prices, Wilson sought to signal a return to pragmatic social-democratic governance, and an Opinion Research Centre poll in April found that six out of ten voters\u2014including a majority of Liberals\u2014felt that Labour had been \u2018much more moderate and constructive than they expected\u2019.[CITATION-103] The Liberal Party was also divided in its analysis of the February result, since some activists believed that Thorpe had overdone the case for \u2018moderation\u2019 and should have offered a more \u2018assertive presentation of Liberal policies\u2019.[CITATION-104] By contrast, Thorpe was more impressed by the strong public support for co-operation, and worried that Heath would succeed in blaming the Liberals for putting Labour in office. In June, Thorpe and his chief whip David Steel went on television to declare that they were still willing to form a Government of National Unity (GNU) if the next election proved inconclusive.[CITATION-105] Polls carried out during the summer of 1974 found wide support for the principle of such a government; as Heath\u2019s Shadow Cabinet noted in July, the country was \u2018currently going through one of its coalition moods\u2019.[CITATION-106] Even the most cursory examination of the idea, however, revealed two serious problems. Firstly, a succession of Conservative MPs\u2014mostly moderates such as Maurice Macmillan and Ian Gilmour\u2014publicly expressed an interest in a coalition, whereas Labour ministers vigorously rejected it.[CITATION-107] The Liberals pointed out that Heath\u2019s confrontational record in office meant that he could hardly pose as a unifying figure, but that implied that they might be willing to serve under a different Tory leader.[CITATION-108] Secondly, as Jo Grimond pointed out, any coalition would need a clear \u2018goal\u2019, since the country would \u2018not be pulled out of its decline simply by cobbling together a Cabinet of different parties\u2019.[CITATION-109] The obvious rationale for co-operation was to deal with the economic crisis created by the oil shock, which by mid-1974 had produced rapid inflation and a large balance-of-payments deficit.[CITATION-110] Thorpe thus used a speech at Loughborough in July to set out a \u2018minimum programme required to save this country from economic disaster\u2019, involving prices and incomes controls, electoral reform, industrial co-partnership, and cuts in \u2018prestige projects\u2019 in order to redirect resources to social security.[CITATION-111] Yet thoughwas impressed by the \u2018Left-wing flavour\u2019 of his speech, many of the Liberals\u2019 most attractive social policies had already been pre-empted by the minority Labour government.[CITATION-112] To many on the left, a GNU seemed to be little more than a vehicle to manoeuvre Labour out of office, re-impose wage restraint, and smuggle in proportional representation by the back door.Suspicions that the Liberals were tacking to the centre right were reinforced by a hardening of the party\u2019s economic stance after the February election. John Pardoe, for instance, warned in lurid terms that Britain was \u2018approaching that situation of \u201cexplosive inflation\u201d which has been experienced in so many South American countries\u2019, which would be \u2018a danger to our society, to our politics, to our Parliamentary Institutions, to our very democracy\u2019. Though he rejected monetarism on the grounds that mass unemployment was unacceptable, he argued that \u2018the menace of inflation must be met; met hard; and met now\u2019, and accused the Labour Chancellor, Denis Healey, of attempting to evade the problem.[CITATION-113] Faced with an interventionist Labour government and corporate alarm about a \u2018profits squeeze\u2019, some Liberal MPs also began to worry about the survival of the market economy. Pardoe declared that Labour\u2019s attempt to hold down prices through controls and subsidies was \u2018nuts\u2019, while Wainwright warned that \u2018Export-led growth cannot be achieved by State-shackled manufacturing industry\u2019.[CITATION-114] Even Thorpe claimed that Britain had become \u2018a nation living beyond its means, with a standard of living which cannot be sustained by our current level of economic activity\u2019. Sooner or later, the Liberal leader insisted, the government would have to be honest with the electorate about the need for sacrifice.[CITATION-115] This gloomy analysis of Britain\u2019s economic position meant that the Liberal message in the October 1974 campaign sat rather awkwardly with the glitzy style which Thorpe had chosen. The party had calculated that a vote share of 26\u201328 per cent would deliver a much larger block of MPs, and Thorpe hoped that his tour of target seats\u2014first by hovercraft and then by helicopter\u2014would help attract the media coverage required for a national breakthrough.[CITATION-116] In addition to television news coverage, the Liberals gained sympathetic treatment from much of the press, which discussed the party\u2019s manifesto \u2018with unprecedented seriousness\u2019 and covered Thorpe\u2019s speeches at length.[CITATION-117] Alastair Hetherington ofechoed the Liberal argument that \u2018consensus\u2019 could be \u2018tough, progressive, and fair\u2019, whileendorsed a GNU and,, and thesupported a Conservative\u2013Liberal coalition with varying degrees of clarity.[CITATION-118] By Liberal standards, the campaign was also well resourced, though the party was still poorer than its rivals. Across the two elections of 1974, Conservative Central Office spent over \u00a31.6 million and Transport House just under \u00a31 million, while even the inclusion of Thorpe\u2019s direct aid accounts only took central Liberal spending to about \u00a3300,000.[CITATION-119] At constituency level, the gap was smaller: Liberal candidates\u2019 election expenses averaged \u00a3725 in October, compared with \u00a31,275 for Conservatives and \u00a31,163 for Labour candidates.[CITATION-120] Alongside the national campaign, the Liberals concentrated their efforts on about forty \u2018critical marginals\u2019, drawing on the work of the Winnable Seats Committee, which Thorpe had established in the 1960s, and the experience which agents such as John Spiller had gained in the 1972\u20133 by-elections.[CITATION-121] Almost all of these seats were Conservative-held, so squeezing residual Labour support became a particular focus.[CITATION-122] As both Labour and the Conservatives sought to burnish their moderate credentials, however, Liberal poll ratings struggled to break through the 20 per cent mark. In the final week of the campaign, Thorpe focused his argument back on political reform in an attempt to \u2018sharpen and simplify\u2019 the party\u2019s message:Shall we persevere with the mistakes of a quarter of a century for another five years on October 10, or shall we have the courage to BREAK THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM\u2014AND SAVE BRITAIN[?][CITATION-123] Peter Riddell of thethought Thorpe was \u2018more surefooted\u2019 after this pivot, but there was no Liberal surge, and attempts to attract tactical anti-Tory votes bore little fruit.[CITATION-124] Overall, the Liberal vote share fell back slightly, and the party dropped to thirteen seats, losing Hazel Grove and Bodmin while gaining Truro. The BES survey found an enormous \u2018churn\u2019 in Liberal support, as the party lost almost half its February voters but gained about two million others.[CITATION-125] The party\u2019s post-election inquests revealed a range of views. David Steel argued that the Liberal message had been \u2018too intellectual and too complicated\u2019 and that the party needed to strengthen its appeal to \u2018erstwhile Labour voters\u2019, but some activists felt that Thorpe and Steel\u2019s musings about coalition had alienated precisely this group.[CITATION-126] Some members of the national executive thought the emphasis on \u2018the gravity of the country\u2019s economic situation\u2019 had been overdone, to the detriment of \u2018other matters of equally vital concern to the people\u2019. Others complained that \u2018the image of frivolity surrounding the Leader \u2026 contrasted with the serious nature of the campaign\u2019, and that the party had \u2018failed to promote\u2019 the \u2018grass roots campaigning image\u2019 implied by the community politics strategy.[CITATION-127] R.W. Johnson has characterised the period between 1974 and 1976 as the era of the UK\u2019s \u2018Great Fear\u2019, in which \u2018parts of the establishment began seriously to consider alternatives to our present form of parliamentary democracy\u2019.[CITATION-128] Rapid inflation\u2014peaking around 25 per cent in 1975\u2014and the perceived humiliation of the 1976 IMF crisis led to widespread talk of national decline and social breakdown, reinforced by a wider cultural mood which made the 1970s \u2018the golden age of paranoia\u2019.[CITATION-129] At the most extreme end of the spectrum, figures such as the retired general Sir Walter Walker and the Cold War strategist Brian Crozier were rumoured to be flirting with the possibility of a military coup, and New Left commentators such as Stuart Hall warned that middle-class complaints about inflation, taxation and crime would provide fertile territory for \u2018authoritarian populism\u2019.[CITATION-130] Yet talk of realignment and constitutional change also drew on more liberal and progressive sources, including the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign in the June 1975 referendum, which brought Heath, Jenkins and Thorpe together to argue in favour of continued EEC membership. As Robert Saunders has pointed out, \u2018the spirit of cross-party solidarity embodied by Britain in Europe was widely applauded\u2019 in the press, and the referendum result was seen as a decisive victory for \u2018moderates\u2019 over the Labour left and the Powellite right.[CITATION-131] , for instance, followed up the referendum by calling for a centrist coalition which could give effect to the shared goals of the \u2018middle majority\u2019.[CITATION-132] The shift from election season to the normal routines of parliamentary life made it hard for the Liberals to maintain the high public profile they had gained in 1974. Although the Labour government\u2019s slim majority of three seats gave smaller parties some leverage, the Liberals found themselves jostling with the eleven Scottish National Party MPs, three Plaid Cymru MPs, and assorted Northern Irish politicians for influence and media coverage.[CITATION-133] Margaret Thatcher\u2019s election as Conservative leader helped to restore Tory morale, and Thorpe\u2019s position was under fire even before Norman Scott\u2019s allegations broke into the public domain in January 1976.[CITATION-134] By the time Thorpe resigned as leader in May 1976, the Liberals had fallen back to 10 per cent in the polls and were starting to experience heavy losses in local elections.Despite these setbacks, some of the themes which the Liberals had launched into public debate in 1973\u20134 continued to resonate. In particular, the case for electoral reform had begun to take on a life of its own before the October 1974 election, when the Oxford political scientist S.E. Finer used an article into articulate a \u2018defence of deadlock\u2019.[CITATION-135] Finer argued that the \u2018conventional wisdom\u2019 that the first-past-the-post system delivered \u2018firm and stable government\u2019 was no longer tenable, since neither Wilson nor Heath had managed to tame the unions, and the combination of economic crises (in 1967 and 1972) and electoral swings (in 1970 and 1974) had produced a succession of sharp policy reversals.[CITATION-136] Under a PR system, with coalition or minority governments, \u2018social and economic policy would be more continuous, more incremental and more self-consistent\u2019, and it would be \u2018all but impossible for one powerful sectional interest to bully or to capture parliament\u2019.[CITATION-137] Finer recruited sympathetic colleagues such as Nevil Johnson and the economists Thomas Wilson and David Stout to help flesh out this argument in a book of essays on(1975), and the \u2018adversary politics thesis\u2019 became a staple of UK political science literature during the late 1970s and 1980s.[CITATION-138] The Hansard Society sponsored a Commission on Electoral Reform chaired by the Conservative historian Lord Blake, which came out in favour of a switch to either the Additional Member System or the Single Transferable Vote.[CITATION-139] Lord Harlech, the chairman of the European Movement and a former British ambassador to Washington, also launched a National Committee for Electoral Reform (NCER) in June 1976 to co-ordinate a public campaign on the issue.[CITATION-140] The adversary politics thesis was strongly influenced by the apparent success of the West German political system in maintaining policy stability and public consent for anti-inflationary measures during the mid-1970s. As the NCER\u2019s director Richard Holme put it, West Germany was \u2018a democracy which works\u2019.[CITATION-141] This vision of a consensus democracy was particularly attractive to many of the technocrats who had struggled to make corporatism work in Britain over the previous decade; for instance, the director general of the National Economic Development Office, Ronald McIntosh, voted Liberal in the two 1974 elections and publicly urged politicians to break free from \u2018adversary politics\u2019.[CITATION-142] At the same time, PR also appealed to businessmen who feared the rise of a left-wing Labour government and complained that policy instability was undermining their investment plans. For instance, a meeting of British United Industrialists in June 1975 found \u2018considerable agreement that the present electoral system \u2026 is very bad for private enterprise which needs to make long-term plans and cannot know whether such plans might be viable under whatever Government may be in power\u2019.[CITATION-143] Thorpe canvassed business support for PR during 1974 and 1975, and drew a sympathetic response from figures such as Sir Val Duncan of Rio Tinto Zinc and Sir Marcus Sieff of Marks & Spencer.[CITATION-144] This interest in constitutional reform overlapped somewhat uneasily with right-wing machinations against the Labour government. Indeed, Duncan reportedly convened a dinner for business leaders in May 1975 at which he talked about how the army would \u2018play its proper role\u2019 if the UK descended into anarchy.[CITATION-145] Thorpe hoped that corporate donors would either defect to the Liberals or use their influence to swing the Conservatives round to electoral reform, but in the end, neither happened. Though Heathite MPs such as Douglas Hurd and Sir George Young were sympathetic, Margaret Thatcher was deeply hostile to both PR and the broader coalitionist impulse.[CITATION-146] As her biographer Charles Moore has noted, \u2018\u201cNational unity\u201d annoyed Mrs. Thatcher very much\u2019, because she \u2018instinctively preferred the public two-party battle to a world of private understandings and shifting alliances\u2019 and \u2018believed that the answer to the national crisis was not the forging of a national consensus round the old, wrong policies, but a bold leap for new, right ones\u2019.[CITATION-147] The Conservatives\u2019 rejection of consensus politics reflected Thatcher\u2019s commitment to monetarism and the wider free-market agenda, which (as Jim Bulpitt pointed out in his classic analysis of Tory \u2018statecraft\u2019) offered an alternative means of reasserting the authority of the state.[CITATION-148] At the same time, this strategic decision was also shaped by a particular view of the \u2018Liberal vote\u2019. The October 1974 Tory campaign had been premised on the belief that voters who had abandoned Heath for Thorpe favoured \u2018moderation\u2019, but Thatcher and her allies were more impressed by the heterogeneity of Liberal support. Nigel Lawson, for instance, insisted that the assumption that \u2018the Liberal vote is a liberal vote\u2019 was a \u2018complete misconception\u2019. Rather, Thorpe had attracted an anti-establishment \u2018protest vote\u2019 which had already largely disintegrated by the late 1970s.[CITATION-149] The belief that \u2018a special ploy to get the \u2026 Liberal vote\u2019 was unnecessary meant that the Conservatives tackled the Liberals \u2018in a very low key\u2019 during the 1979 campaign.[CITATION-150] Even so, Thatcher did develop a distinctive approach to dealing with the party. As Saunders has pointed out, the sharp rhetorical contrast which Thatcher drew between Conservative \u2018freedom\u2019 and Labour\u2019s \u2018socialism\u2019 had the effect of \u2018squeezing the space for the Liberals\u2019 and reinforcing the bipolar tendencies of the existing electoral system.[CITATION-151] Like Winston Churchill in the 1940s, Thatcher tapped in to an essentially liberal political language and positioned the Tories as the defenders of traditional Liberal values such as free enterprise, self-help and personal responsibility.[CITATION-152] Thatcher\u2019s efforts to polarise debate on these lines were aided by growing frustration with tax, regulation and trade union power among large sections of the middle class. For Thatcher and her sympathisers, such as Ronald Butt in, the Liberals had become \u2018a by-stander in the essential political battle\u2019 over the role of the state in British society.[CITATION-153] The long-standing Tory claim that \u2018a vote for the Liberals is a vote for Labour\u2019 was strengthened by David Steel\u2019s decision to prop up the Callaghan government through the 1977\u20138 Lib\u2013Lab Pact.[CITATION-154] The Pact is perhaps best understood as a reflection of Steel\u2019s belief that the Liberals needed to gain credibility as a potential governing partner if \u2018realignment\u2019 was ever to happen.[CITATION-155] At the same time, the Pact also marked an important shift in the party\u2019s public discourse. During 1974\u20135, Thorpe and Pardoe had framed Britain\u2019s economic and political malaise as an existential crisis which could be only be overcome through immediate and radical change; under Steel, the party\u2019s tone became more orthodox and incremental. Steel threw his weight behind the Callaghan government\u2019s economic strategy, including the spending cuts which Denis Healey had agreed with the IMF, and sought to take credit for the recovery that followed. Through the Pact, the Liberals argued, \u2018doctrinaire Socialism\u2019 had been curbed, inflation had fallen from 18 per cent to less than 10 per cent, and the UK had experienced \u2018a remarkable recovery of financial confidence\u2019.[CITATION-156] Yet the actual policy concessions which Steel obtained were slim, and mainly involved tax changes (such as incentives for profit-sharing). As Michael Steed warned in a 1978 strategy paper, Steel\u2019s emphasis on moderation was \u2018a negative appeal, unlikely to build up committed support\u2019, even if it fitted \u2018logically and naturally with a balance of power strategy\u2019.[CITATION-157] Jo Grimond posed the issue more starkly to the journalist Hugo Young: \u2018What is happening, in all this, to the Liberals as the party that wants to bust the system?\u2019[CITATION-158] When the 1979 election came, Steel fought an effective and well-organised campaign, and fears of a full-scale collapse did not materialise.[CITATION-159] Nevertheless, the Liberals\u2019 fall from 18.3 per cent to 13.8 per cent of the vote made a significant contribution to Thatcher\u2019s victory. Between October 1974 and 1979, the Conservative vote rose by 3.2 million. BES data suggest that this involved a net gain of about a million votes from the Liberals and about 750,000 votes from Labour, with the rest coming from differential turnout and the minor parties.[CITATION-160] The BES found that most of the Thorpe-to-Thatcher switchers were former Conservative voters who were returning to the fold, but some were new converts.[CITATION-161] Thatcher not only won back middle-class voters (and especially women) who had flirted with the Liberals earlier in the decade, but also made inroads into traditional Liberal heartlands.[CITATION-162] In particular, the Conservatives defeated Thorpe in North Devon and Pardoe in North Cornwall, and won the rural Welsh seat of Montgomery for the first time since 1874. The fact that Thorpe was about to stand trial on charges of conspiracy to murder a former gay lover hardly helped the Liberal cause.[CITATION-163] By contrast, Thatcher\u2019s brand of Conservatism, rooted in her provincial Methodist background, resonated with many small-business people and Nonconformist voters. As in 1970, the Liberals found it difficult to insulate themselves from a middle-class backlash against Labour\u2019s economic record or to deflect the Tories\u2019 appeal to cultural conservatism.Set in this broader context, it is clear that the Liberal revival is of profound importance for our understanding of political change in 1970s Britain. The events of 1972\u20134 established the Liberals as a major political force across rural and suburban England for the first time since the Second World War, building on the foundations which had been laid in the Orpington period. Thorpe and his colleagues articulated a resonant critique of class politics and warned that Conservative and Labour governments were leading the nation into crisis; as such, they were agents as well as beneficiaries of dealignment. At a cultural level, the Liberals gave expression both to young voters\u2019 frustration with the starchiness and materialism of post-war politics and to a more conservative (and in many ways antithetical) impulse towards \u2018national unity\u2019. The very ambiguity of Liberal policy contributed to this broad appeal. In particular, the demand for electoral reform and the belief in \u2018community politics\u2019 allowed the Liberals to adopt the rhetoric of \u2018anti-system\u2019 populism while remaining firmly committed to pluralist parliamentary democracy.[CITATION-164] By framing \u2018adversary politics\u2019 as a hangover from the industrial conflicts of the early twentieth century, the Liberals also tapped in to a growing sense that class-based identities were becoming anachronistic. Voting Liberal was a simple way for people to assert their political agency, even (or perhaps especially) if it was a one-off act rather than a lasting conversion.The political scientist Peter Hall has characterised the mid- and late 1970s as a period of deep political choice in Britain, in which the crisis of confidence in Keynesian economic management opened up the \u2018marketplace for economic ideas\u2019 and paved the way for a \u2018paradigm shift\u2019 towards monetarism and neo-liberalism.[CITATION-165] In this marketplace, the Liberals offered a distinctive proposition, albeit one based mainly on constitutional rather than economic radicalism. Indeed, the Liberals\u2019 response to inflation and industrial conflict was strongly coloured by the technocratic, productivist and nationalist assumptions which permeated Britain\u2019s post-war settlement.[CITATION-166] Yet though the prospect of a renewed consensus was an attractive one, the Liberals\u2019 strategy for shoring up Keynesian welfare capitalism was not without its limitations. In particular, Pardoe\u2019s economic policy relied heavily on the belief that a package of redistribution, workers\u2019 participation, and constitutional reform could make statutory wage controls effective and politically sustainable.[CITATION-167] This was always an optimistic notion, and became more so over time as the mid-1970s recession and the IMF loan reduced the scope for \u2018flanking\u2019 wage restraint with progressive social policies. Nor was the party well prepared to confront the hard choices which coalition would require. For instance, most Liberal voters in 1974 saw the party as closer to the Conservatives than to Labour, whereas Liberal activists leaned to the left and (as the row over Heath\u2019s coalition offer showed) were generally hostile to working with the Tories.[CITATION-168] The broad but shallow nature of the Liberal breakthrough can also be seen as a reflection of Thorpe\u2019s leadership style. As Peter Bessell noted, the February 1974 campaign was \u2018a personal triumph for Jeremy\u2019:In an age dominated by TV personalities, he succeeded in conveying to the viewers the policies of his party in simple terms while projecting a personal image of statesmanship fortified by idealism.[CITATION-169] Heath\u2019s lack of charisma and charm created a political opening which Thorpe energetically filled. At his best, he helped the Liberals tap into an iconoclastic mood while remaining a \u2018safe\u2019 option for erstwhile Tory voters. Yet Thorpe\u2019s focus on publicity rather than ideas also came at a political cost, and by the time of the October election there were signs that his appeal was already waning.[CITATION-170] His reputation as \u2018a preening dandy who adored the limelight\u2019 tended to undermine the credibility of Liberal policies and to obscure the more creative currents of activism at the Liberal grass roots.[CITATION-171] This made it easy for critics to portray the party as a narrowly electoral machine, characterised by \u2018rootless opportunism and occasional poujaedism\u2019 (as the Labour MP Phillip Whitehead put it in 1981), rather than a principled political movement.[CITATION-172] Even so, the legacies of 1974 lived on, most obviously in the SDP/Liberal Alliance. Roy Jenkins\u2019s landmark 1979 Dimbleby Lecture drew heavily on the critique of \u2018adversary politics\u2019 that had emerged earlier in the decade; if the voice was unmistakeably Jenkins\u2019s own, most of the words could have been written by John Pardoe or S.E. Finer. The Gang of Four gave the Alliance the gravitas which Thorpe had lacked, though Jenkins\u2019s lacklustre performance in the 1983 campaign suggested that this was a dubious asset. Thatcher\u2019s confident leadership and renewed popularity after the Falklands War also made it hard to present constitutional reform as an urgent response to a looming crisis. The SDP\u2019s focus groups in the run-up to the 1983 election found that the language of stability and national unity still resonated, but this was \u2018not interpreted as meaning a need for centrist policies\u2019 so much as allowing Thatcher to \u2018finish the job\u2019 she had embarked on.[CITATION-173] As the Alliance struggled to \u2018break the mould\u2019, 1974 passed into Liberal mythology as a reminder of what the party had achieved on its own and how little progress had been made. \u2018What were all the doubts, humiliations, climb-downs, sell-outs and surrenders to Dr Owen \u2026 for\u2019, a dispirited contributor tomagazine asked after the 1987 election, \u2018when we have gained a total haul of seats and votes not greatly in excess of that won by a scratch Liberal campaign 13 years ago?\u2019[CITATION-174] Only when the Conservative vote collapsed in 1997 did the Liberal Democrats manage to convert the electoral potential which Thorpe had revealed into significant parliamentary gains. Only when Nick Clegg took the party into government in 2010 did it become clear that the bond between its leaders and its voters was just as fragile as it had been in the 1970s.[CITATION-175] ",
