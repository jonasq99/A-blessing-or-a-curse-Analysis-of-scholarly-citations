    "article": "The Albigensian Crusade (1209\u201329) was a formative event in European history. At the medieval apogee of its power, the Roman Church called for the extirpation of heresy in southern France. The crusading energies that had galvanised the aristocracy of Latin Christendom for more than a century against Islam, the pagans of northeast Europe, and other external enemies, were now directed against the inhabitants of a region in the heart of Christendom. Twenty years of campaigning broke the power of the nobility of Occitania, allowing the Capetian monarchy to extend its sway to the Mediterranean and so paving the way for French supremacy in western Europe. This political revolution made possible the establishment of the Inquisition to root out heresy. These two decades of warfare in Languedoc and Provence therefore contributed to a much broader refiguration of religious authority and temporal power across the continent.Despite extensive research into the history of the crusading expeditions to Languedoc between 1209 and 1229, as well as that of ensuing royal campaigns until 1244,[CITATION-1] relatively little has been written about their participants. For instance, two major recent histories of the Albigensian Crusade devote scant attention to identifying crusaders or to considering the ties between them that may have assisted recruitment and contributed to the organisation of the crusades.[CITATION-2] The only extensive research concerning the participants in the Albigensian Crusade has concentrated upon the small number who joined the campaigns for a lengthy duration, particularly the associates of Simon de Montfort (d. 1218) who dominated the enterprise until 1224, when Louis VIII of France effectively took over its leadership from Montfort\u2019s son Amaury. Christine Keck-Woehl, Claire Dutton and Jean-Louis Biget, among others, have demonstrated how Montfort relied on a tight knot of crusaders from the \u00cele-de-France, many of whom were already bound to him by ties of kinship, neighbourhood and association, as well as on individual adventurers from Burgundy, Champagne, Normandy and elsewhere. These studies have also traced the endeavours of the long-term participants in the crusade to establish themselves in the lands of dispossessed southern landowners and to govern a vast territory, demonstrating how new connections between the crusaders were forged in the turmoil of a long and bitter war.[CITATION-3] However, the vast majority of crusaders joined the crusade for only a brief period, often no more than forty days, which became the standard term of service at an early stage of the campaign; these short-term participants have received very little attention from historians.[CITATION-4] Most research about them has been limited to brief prosopographical studies concerning particular regions of France and Belgium, which provide little more than simple lists of crusaders, mostly gleaned from the main narrative sources.[CITATION-5] There are a few more developed studies of participation, but these concentrate on certain campaigns or recruit from specific areas: they include a recent analysis of the size and membership of the army that notoriously massacred the citizens of B\u00e9ziers in 1209[CITATION-6] and surveys of the English role in the crusade, all of which place recruitment to the crusade from England within the broader context of the troubled lordship of the kings of England in southwest France in this period.[CITATION-7] In view of the restricted character of these studies, even some basic questions remain difficult to answer about this broader mass of participants: who went on the crusade, where they came from, how and why they were recruited to the expeditions and how they funded their campaigns.[CITATION-8] One likely reason for the neglect of the vast majority of participants is, ironically, the richness of the narrative sources. Two texts in particular, the Latin proseby Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay and the Occitanusually known as the, begun by William of Tudela and continued by an anonymous author, have dominated modern histories of the expeditions, and the cessation of these compelling narratives in 1218 and 1219, respectively, has acted as a major hindrance to our understanding of the second half of the crusade; later narratives such as William de Puylaurens\u2019 chronicle, written in the 1270s, are much less informative.[CITATION-9] By and large, documentary evidence for the crusaders has received far less attention, especially charters and administrative records from the crusaders\u2019 homelands, and much of it remains unpublished.[CITATION-10] This neglect of non-narrative sources, especially those issued on behalf of the participants themselves, stands in stark contrast to the study of the crusades to Jerusalem. In 1953, a groundbreaking article by Giles Constable drew attention to charters as a hitherto unused source for the crusades.[CITATION-11] Since then, numerous historians, notably Jean Longnon, James M. Powell and Jonathan Riley-Smith and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, have carried out extensive research into the identity of crusaders and the connections between them (such as kinship and lordship) that may have aided recruitment, and they have focussed on charters as alternative sources to the crusading narratives: in the process they have uncovered new evidence for how the expeditions to the Levant were understood at the time.[CITATION-12] The neglect of important documentary sources for the Albigensian Crusade means that in many ways the historiography of these expeditions is still at a stage that the study of the First Crusade reached more than half a century ago.[CITATION-13] Yet, these sources offer very different perspectives on the expedition and its participants from the better-known narrative accounts. Indeed, the standard critical editions of the(1926\u201339) and the(1958\u201361) recognised as much, providing extensive references to charters and other documentary sources for participants which have been more or less ignored since their publication.[CITATION-14] The present study aims to demonstrate the importance of non-narrative sources as evidence for the Albigensian Crusade and its participants. It first identifies the various types of documentary sources from the crusaders\u2019 homelands and discusses the problems that they pose as evidence for participation in the crusade. It then assesses the broader significance of these largely untapped sources for the expedition. In particular, it considers what they reveal about the participants\u2019 understandings of the campaigns that they were joining, as well as about their views of the heretics whom they were seeking to eradicate. The documentary sources provide crucial evidence for the participants\u2019 belief that they were going on a \u2018pilgrimage\u2019 directed against a people called \u2018Albigensians\u2019. These documents therefore challenge a recent trend in the historical literature, exemplified most clearly in the works of Jean-Louis Biget and Mark Pegg, which maintains that the term \u2018Albigensian\u2019 was not used as the main term for Languedocian heretics  until some time after the crusade had begun; instead, the evidence examined here indicates that from the outset, \u2018Albigensian\u2019 was the principal term used by its opponents to describe the heresy in the region.[CITATION-15] Hence, the present article uses documentary sources not only to identify crusaders but also to cast a much broader light upon the nature of the Albigensian Crusade.Documentary sources concerning the Albigensian Crusade fall into several groups, including charters, fiscal accounts, judicial records and inquests and letters. A great number of documents that mention the crusade are charters, most of which recorded transactions in the crusaders\u2019 homelands, especially grants to religious houses. Some of the charters mentioning the Albigensian Crusade have been printed in modern critical editions, but the majority remain unpublished. Excluding the charters of the Montfort dynasty, which form a special group since they were issued by the crusade\u2019s long-term leaders,[CITATION-16] approximately 160 charters referring to participants in the Albigensian Crusade have been identified during the preparation of the present study, and more than three quarters of them are cited here. They are scattered across the archives of modern France and Belgium, a distribution which reflects the way in which the crusade attracted recruits from across the medieval kingdom of France and adjacent territories of the (Holy Roman) Empire. Some charters survive as original deeds, but many are known only from later medieval and antiquarian transcripts or early printed editions; a significant number of copies are preserved in cartularies, the registers of title deeds that were compiled by religious houses and occasionally by lay dynasties, such as the rulers of the county of Champagne.[CITATION-17] In the central middle ages, charters were the principal means of recording contracts and grants in northern and western Europe. Most often their stated purpose was to record endowments for prayers for the souls of the benefactor and their relatives, which imposed constraints upon their \u2018diplomatic\u2019 form; nevertheless, charters could refer to crusades in several ways, although these altered over time.[CITATION-18] At the time of the First Crusade (1096\u201399), charters usually included clauses explaining the purpose of the transaction being recorded (the), a description of the transaction\u2014such as the conveyance of property (the) and clauses putting the act into effect (the) and often imposing spiritual or secular penalties for anyone infringing the terms of the transaction (the). They also sometimes noted the consent of the issuer\u2019s relatives (the) and might end with a list of witnesses (the) and a clause giving the date and place of the act. All of these clauses could include references to a crusade or crusader if it was relevant to the transaction in some way.Many deeds recorded grants, pledges or leases of property that were directly related to the crusade, for instance, when crusaders were raising funds for the expedition or resolving disputes before departure: theormight well mention the crusade when explaining the terms and context of such grants. Other charters were issued by crusaders while they were on crusade: these do not always concern the expedition itself, in which case their significance for the crusade usually comes from the witness-list, which provides evidence of participants, or from a locative dating clause. Some relevant charters were not issued by, or on behalf of, a crusader but mention third parties as participants in a crusade, usually in theor(for instance, where gifts were made for the soul of a deceased crusader, or if an absent crusader would be required to ratify the act in question upon his return). Finally, other acts cannot be described as \u2018crusade charters\u2019, in so far as they were neither issued during an expedition nor mentioned directly, but they are nevertheless informative, for instance, by revealing pre-existing ties between members of crusading armies, often in the, which recorded the relatives who gave their consent to the transaction in the charter.[CITATION-19] The documentary sources for the Albigensian Crusade have certain advantages over the deeds arising from the early crusades to Jerusalem. Charters were far more numerous in the early thirteenth than the late eleventh century, and by 1200, a great many of them were being issued on behalf of minor landowners, burgesses and clerks, rather than just the greater nobility, in part because of the rise of the new religious orders to whom these social groups were particularly attached.[CITATION-20] Early thirteenth-century charters are also much more likely to be dated than their counterparts of a century earlier. Some were also produced in princely or aristocratic chanceries, which means that the statements of intent are less likely to reflect monastic or other ecclesiastical discourses.On the other hand, thirteenth-century charters have certain disadvantages compared with the deeds from the early crusades to the Levant. The acts of participants in the First Crusade are often very narrative in quality, in accordance with the diplomatic conventions of their day: they are relatively formless and much less formulaic than their thirteenth-century counterparts. This allowed the drafter of the charter to offer a long explanation in theof what the crusader was believed to be doing by setting off on the expedition. Although most of these texts must have been written by the ecclesiastical beneficiary, they nevertheless offer a strictly contemporary understanding of crusading motives and aspirations: those from 1096, for instance, are not \u2018tainted\u2019 by the hindsight of the capture of Jerusalem and so they offer a unique insight into the participants\u2019 attitudes before they left their homelands.[CITATION-21] They also usually have long witness-lists which can play an important role in identifying participants and the connections between them.Early thirteenth-century charters are very different in style and content. They are much less prolix than a century earlier, meaning that they have a less \u2018narrative\u2019 character, and they are also more tightly formulated, with a conventional order of clauses and more standardised formulae than was the case at the time of the First Crusade.[CITATION-22] Thein a thirteenth-century charter was normally brief and provided little explanation of the specific purpose of the transaction; the less narrative quality of acts also meant that they were less likely than those of a century earlier to refer to events such as crusades, or to name third parties such as absent or deceased crusaders. Moreover, from the beginning of the thirteenth century, northern French charters increasingly lacked witness-lists, a major shortcoming for reconstructing sociopolitical connections.[CITATION-23] In contrast to the charters of previous centuries, dating clauses rarely referred to great events and so they usually mentioned the Albigensian Crusade only if they were issued during a particular siege.[CITATION-24] Given the more constrained form of charters by 1209, it is not surprising that references to the Albigensian Crusade in charters of departing crusaders appear very arbitrary. The mention of the crusade in a charter\u2019smay have served as anfor the parties to the transaction in question and as an explanation for its purpose, and it could also highlight the crusader\u2019s piety as one part of the scribe\u2019s explanation of gifts to religious houses. Yet, while about 100 known acts of departing crusaders from France and neighbouring territories refer to the Albigensian Crusades and its aftermath between 1209 and the 1240s, hundreds of other extant deeds must have been drawn up by crusaders as they prepared to set off but do not mention that context.[CITATION-25] Ducal charters in Burgundy reveal just how haphazard the references to the crusade often were. In the spring and early summer of 1209, the duke and duchess of Burgundy issued at least ten, and possibly as many as twenty-eight, acts before Duke Odo departed as one of the leaders of the first campaign against the heretics. Only six mention the impending expedition, although most of the others dealt either with raising cash or with putting ducal affairs in order, and so they, too, reflected the context of the duke\u2019s imminent departure.[CITATION-26] Moreover, charters from 1209 onwards frequently refer to \u2018crusaders\u2019 () or \u2018pilgrims\u2019 () without stipulating whether they were on their way to the Albigensian Crusade or one of the other contemporary theatres of holy war such as the Levant, Spain or the Baltic.[CITATION-27] In July 1210, an act of the Flemish lord, Eustace de Campagne, described him merely as, but we know from other acts that he was going to the Albigeois.[CITATION-28] By contrast, when the monks of the abbey of S\u00e9ry in Ponthieu gave 20to a knight called Hugh de Saint-Hilaire \u2018to perform his pilgrimage against unbelievers\u2019, it is impossible to know from this undated act where Hugh intended to fight.[CITATION-29] Chronological, geographical and family considerations may help us to decide whether crusaders were going to the Albigeois rather than elsewhere. Some time after 1206, Thomas du Hommet, son of the constable of Normandy, issued two acts on the eve of a \u2018pilgrimage\u2019,[CITATION-30] and it is tempting to link his proposed journey to the participation of his brother, Bishop Jordan of Lisieux, in Simon de Montfort\u2019s siege of Lavaur in 1211.[CITATION-31] The nature of the Albigensian Crusade itself may have reduced the likelihood of the expedition appearing in charters, compared with crusades to the Holy Land. The journey from northern France to Languedoc took only a couple of weeks, and most participants did not stay long in the Midi: Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay repeatedly complains about the speedy departure of crusaders after forty days of service, regardless of the military situation, and occasionally even before the appointed term was complete.[CITATION-32] Hence, Gaucher de Ch\u00e2tillon, count of Saint-Pol, was prominent in three campaigns in Languedoc, first as one of the leaders of the original expedition in 1209 and later as a companion of Louis of France in 1215 and 1219, but his published charters make no mention of his involvement in the war against heresy.[CITATION-33] The relatively cheap cost of joining the Albigensian Crusade as compared to expeditions to Jerusalem may also have affected the documentary record. A number of the extant documents for crusades to Jerusalem relate to cash-raising pledges that were never redeemed, either because the pledger failed to return or was too impoverished to redeem the pledge.[CITATION-34] By contrast, the Albigensian Crusades were much shorter than the expeditions to the Levant and less costly in money and crusaders\u2019 lives: as Abbot Gervase of Pr\u00e9montr\u00e9 observed in a recruiting letter, \u2018the pilgrimage is not long either in time or in distance\u2019.[CITATION-35] Consequently, the number of unredeemed pledges for the Albigensian expeditions was presumably much lower than for journeys to the Levant. Credit networks were also more developed by 1200 than a century earlier, and crusaders to Languedoc may have found it easier to raise cash from commercial sources or crusading taxation without needing to make disadvantageous grants to religious houses.[CITATION-36] For the early crusades to Jerusalem, charters in favour of religious houses are almost the only documentary sources apart from a small number of letters of participants and popes, but the same is not true for the Albigensian Crusade. The papal chancery of Innocent III (1198\u20131216) was far more developed than that of his eleventh-century predecessors, systematically compiling registers of much of his outgoing correspondence,[CITATION-37] and the turn of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries also saw an explosion of documentary production by royal and princely households and administrations across western Europe.[CITATION-38] Much of this expanding documentation consisted of letters, which served a very different purpose from charters: whether directed to a single recipient or a general audience, they did not usually record legal transactions that had already taken place, but conveyed instructions or news, and their looser form means that they often provide more context than charters do. They therefore complement both the narrative sources and charters, although they were not entirely distinct from these genres: letters could be retained as evidence of title, while Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay incorporated numerous copies and summaries of royal, papal and legatine letters into his history.[CITATION-39] In addition to letters, new types of evidence were emerging in the institutions of northern France in this period, including the feudal inquests copied into the registers of Philip Augustus, the records of judicial cases at the Norman exchequer, and fiscal records. References to crusaders in these sources are even more haphazard than in charters, and sometimes frustratingly vague, but their concern with finance, land tenure or justice mean that they often mention the Albigensian Crusade in ways that the narrative texts and charters do not. We also have many references to the crusade in administrative texts compiled some time after the crusade\u2019s conclusion in 1229, notably thesubmitted to inquests which were held on behalf of Louis IX in 1247\u201348, on the eve of the Seventh Crusade.The documentary sources for crusaders against the Albigensians therefore have limitations as evidence for the expeditions, but they are very abundant, and some are rich in detail. They offer an alternative perspective upon the crusade to the more familiar narrative sources, both for identifying participants and for depicting how the participants viewed the expeditions which they joined.To assess the significance of the documentary sources for identifying crusaders, it is first necessary to consider what the narrative accounts of the Albigensian wars reveal about the identity of participants. These frequently list provincial groups in the crusading armies. At the siege of Termes in 1210, William of Tudela describes the besieging crusaders as consisting of the following groups:Alaman e Bavier e Saine e Frison,Mancel e Angevi e Norman e Breton,Logombart e Lombart, Proensal e Gascon.[CITATION-40] Lists of this kind were written in a venerable vernacular tradition that can be traced back to the\u2019s celebration of the many peoples whom the Frankish emperor Charlemagne had ruled in the eighth century and which may also reflect the sense of division among the \u2018Franks\u2019 by the time that thewas composed.[CITATION-41] Indeed, William of Tudela explicitly stated that his poem was intended to imitate one of the popular crusading epics of the Antioch cycle, which contain numerous similar lists of alleged participants in the First Crusade.[CITATION-42] Consequently, the poem\u2019s lists cannot be taken at face value as evidence for participating groups in the Albigensian Crusade, although they undoubtedly reflect a contemporary sense of the heterogenous character of the crusading armies in Languedoc.The naming of individual participants in narrative sources confirms the geographical diversity of the crusaders\u2019 origins to an extent, but the authors tended to privilege recruits from \u2018France\u2019, in its narrow sense of the Paris Basin\u2014especially Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay, whose abbey, near Rambouillet in the modernof Yvelines, lay in the heart of that region. Like leading figures among Simon de Montfort\u2019s long-term companions, many \u2018French\u2019 crusaders who came for only a short time were associated with Montfort by kinship, lordship or neighbourhood, including his stepfather and half-brother, the two Williams des Barres, and his brother-in-law Matthew de Montmorency.[CITATION-43] The narratives also list many crusaders from the Paris region who had no direct connection to the Montforts, although some had links to Simon\u2019s neighbours such as the lords of Chevreuse.[CITATION-44] Those from \u2018France\u2019 also included a network around the Capetian dynasty itself. With the very notable exception of Philip Augustus, nearly all the adult males of the Capetian dynasty joined the crusade for short periods, including Louis VIII; the counts of Dreux, Auxerre and Brittany; Bishop Philip of Beauvais and Robert de Courtenay,[CITATION-45] and the husbands of several Capetian women also participated.[CITATION-46] The \u2018French\u2019 are not the only regional groups visible in the narrative accounts. A significant number came from Picardy, notably the lords of Boves, Coucy, Cayeux, and Picquigny, the count of Soissons, and leading churchmen.[CITATION-47] From the regions of the Lower Loire came a group of magnates who were closely related by blood and marriage, namely Juhel de Mayenne, Count Robert of Alen\u00e7on, and the seneschals of Anjou, William des Roches and Amaury de Craon.[CITATION-48] Among the humbler participants, a small group of knights from south-east Normandy stayed on with Simon de Montfort after the initial campaign of 1209 and attracted attention from the narratives chiefly because the men of Toulouse massacred a group of them at the castle of Le Pujol in 1213.[CITATION-49] The documentary evidence significantly qualifies the geographical emphasis of the main narratives. Charters emphasise the importance of Capetian involvement, with major spikes in their numbers on the eve of Louis of France\u2019s expeditions in 1219 and 1226,[CITATION-50] but they offset the preoccupation of Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay with crusaders from the \u00cele-de-France. They reinforce the impression of Picardy as an important source of recruits[CITATION-51] but also show Burgundians as particularly prominent in the earlier stages of the crusade.[CITATION-52] Regions to the north, such as Flanders and Hainault, also appear furnishing crusaders for many of the campaigns, at a time when the influence of the French crown was penetrating those provinces.[CITATION-53] Charters reveal a number of participants from the Western Loire provinces,[CITATION-54] while the deeds documenting the surrender of the count of Foix in 1229, bringing the principal hostilities to a close, show that his submission was largely achieved by a royal force from Touraine and adjacent areas of Berry.[CITATION-55] By contrast, very few Norman crusaders are identifiable from charters; however, royal inquests in 1247 reveal numerous humble Normans fighting in the final stages of the Albigensian Crusade.[CITATION-56] The documentary records also reveal crusaders from regions that receive little or no mention in the narratives. The viscount of Aubusson in Limousin may have taken part in the siege of Toulouse in 1218,[CITATION-57] but a series of charters for the abbey of Bonlieu (in the diocese of Limoges) indicate that he led a little band from the county of La Marche to the Albigeois in 1221, at a time when the crusade was faltering badly.[CITATION-58] Most probably, he joined a force sent by Philip Augustus and led by Archbishop Simon of Bourges and Hugh de Lusignan, count of La Marche, which received only a cursory mention in French and English narrative sources.[CITATION-59] East of the Rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne in the Empire, we find charters of recruits from Savoy, including Count Thomas of Maurienne (d. 1233), from Dauphin\u00e9 and from the county of Burgundy, although unfortunately their acts are mostly undated.[CITATION-60] Other regions revealed through the charters of participants include the county of Forez (between Burgundy and Auvergne) and northern Lorraine.[CITATION-61] Documentary sources therefore suggest a significantly different distribution of regional recruitment from that which appears in the narrative texts.Among the charters relating to the crusade, a significant number were issued during the campaigns themselves, chiefly by the leaders of the crusades or by the small number of crusaders who attempted to settle in the Midi. Simon de Montfort himself was the author of nearly seventy acts between 1209 and 1218,[CITATION-62] and his son Amaury issued at least thirty-four between his father\u2019s death and the aftermath of his sale of his rights in Languedoc to Louis VIII in 1224.[CITATION-63] Louis in turn issued about twenty-five acts during his third expedition against the Albigensians in 1226.[CITATION-64] A handful of charters survive from other long-term crusaders who established themselves as lords in Languedoc: prominent among the benefactors of the first Dominican house at Prouille were the Anglo-Irish exile Hugh de Lacy, who had received Castelnaudary and the surrounding district of the Lauragais;[CITATION-65] the army\u2019s marshal Guy de L\u00e9vis, who became lord of Mirepoix;[CITATION-66] the Burgundian knight Lambert de Thury or Cr\u00e9cy, who acquired Limoux; the Franco-Champenois barons Alan de Roucy, who became lord of Montr\u00e9al, Termes and Bram, and Robert Mauvoisin, who received property at Fanjeaux; and the Picard lord Enguerrand de Boves.[CITATION-67] Despite numerous setbacks, several of these families held on to lands in the Midi, and their descendants appear as lords there later in the thirteenth century. Almost alone among the crusaders against the Albigensians, these men have received substantial historical attention.[CITATION-68] While most of their acts concerned the lands that they had acquired in the Midi, occasionally they chose to endow the houses of Occitania from their ancestral possessions in the North.[CITATION-69] The chief value of these acts is as sources for the activities of Montfort\u2019s companions named in the narratives, especially the exercise of lordship in their southern acquisitions.[CITATION-70] Occasionally, too, they reveal men of humble status overlooked by the crusade narratives, such as two benefactors of Prouille identified as \u2018French-born\u2019 ().[CITATION-71] While acts issued on the campaigns themselves mostly concerned long-term crusaders, they do sometimes reveal more temporary participants, such as the act of Robert, cellarer of C\u00eeteaux, confirming the testament of a dying Burgundian canon at Carcassonne, which was also witnessed by two of their fellow Burgundians.[CITATION-72] In addition, at least 100 acts are known to have been issued by, or on behalf of, short-term crusaders prior to departure. The issuers of these acts include many of the great nobles who joined the expeditions\u2014some of whom were overlooked by contemporary narrative texts.[CITATION-73] Both Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay and William of Tudela recorded Juhel de Mayenne, the most powerful noble in Maine and lord of Dinan in Brittany, at the siege of Lavaur in 1211, but Juhel\u2019s acts show not only that he went on the crusade that year but also that he returned to the region with Louis of France in 1219.[CITATION-74] Yet, one of the chief values of the documentary records is that they allow us to identify crusaders of more modest status than the magnates who attracted the eye of contemporary authors. Such people are unlikely to be named in the narrative sources unless they made their fortunes in the Midi, distinguished themselves in combat or experienced a notoriously gruesome death during the campaigns. Some very humble crusaders issued charters on their own behalf before commencing their journey: William l\u2019Anglais, burgess of Meulan, granted an annual render of 12. to the priory of Meulan when he was \u2018about to set off for the Albigeois\u2019 in 1214.[CITATION-75] More often, a third party such as the lord, bishop or other dignitary issued an act on behalf of a less distinguished crusader\u2019s behalf, usually confirming the arrangements being made prior to the crusader\u2019s departure.[CITATION-76] The documentary evidence also includes more oblique references to people who were absent from ceremonies or court proceedings in their homelands because they had gone to the Albigeois, and here, too, it often reveals individuals who were too minor to be noticed by the chroniclers.[CITATION-77] In 1219, one of the brothers of the Breton lord Oliver de Co\u00ebtquen could not consent to a settlement with a local priory because he was then \u2018in the land of the Albigensians\u2019: presumably, he formed part of the Breton contingent in Louis of France\u2019s second expedition.[CITATION-78] Another participant in that campaign was a brother of Renaud Maleterre from near Amiens: Renaud\u2019s lord, Enguerrand de Boves, who had himself held a lordship in Languedoc for a time, pledged to ensure that the absent crusader would give his consent to a sale once he returned.[CITATION-79] Other deeds mention donors or family members who had perished on the crusade.[CITATION-80] South-east of Paris, Margaret de Vernou inherited her family\u2019s property when her brothers died in the land of the Albigensians.[CITATION-81] The viscount of Meulan had to confirm the grants which his father had made as he was dying in the Albigeois,[CITATION-82] while in 1242, the will of Henry de Blois, chanter of Vernon in Normandy, stated that his brother John had died at Bourges on his way home from Louis VIII\u2019s last crusade sixteen years earlier.[CITATION-83] The absence of figures of authority who had gone to the Albigeois was also sometimes recorded in charters by their deputies, subjects or peers.[CITATION-84] The burgeoning records of royal and ecclesiastical government are also important for documenting the absences of crusaders. One of the feudal surveys of Philip Augustus (which can be dated to between 1218 and 1220) stated that Peter de Saint-Denis, a knight from northeast Normandy, was then in the Albigeois.[CITATION-85] In 1210, a judgment at the Norman exchequer recorded that the viscount of Lisieux had complained after his return from the Albigeois that he had been disseised of some tithes while he was on his \u2018pilgrimage\u2019.[CITATION-86] A few months later, a damaging riot at Chartres pitted the cathedral chapter against the townspeople and officials of the countess of Blois: it required royal intervention because the bishop of Chartres had gone to assist Simon de Montfort in his war against heretics, as a detailed account compiled by the canons related.[CITATION-87] Disputes which arose when crusaders failed to return from the Midi also left their traces in legal records. In 1247, Geoffrey de Reux complained to royal commissioners that, after his father\u2019s death in the \u2018land of the Albigensians\u20191223, the French crown had confiscated his possessions in central Normandy.[CITATION-88] The nature of such records meant that it was sometimes disputed as to when someone had been in the Albigeois, or indeed whether he had gone on crusade at all. At an inquest in 1224, the archdeacon of Sens could not recall whether his archbishop\u2019s absence some years earlier had been due to the Albigensian Crusade or the Fourth Lateran Council.[CITATION-89] In 1247 a Norman knight called Matthew de Morainville alleged that about forty years earlier, he had been arrested by a royal bailiff on the charge of being present at the killing of a squire in Pont-Audemer, and was charged 200for his release; but he claimed that at the time of the squire\u2019s death, he had been \u2018fighting the Albigensians, when the castle of Termes was captured by the count of Montfort\u2019.[CITATION-90] Although the chronology so long after the event is inaccurate, this case demonstrates how the absence of crusaders sometimes left its mark upon royal records many years after the campaigns themselves.It has been noted above that royal and papal letters from the period are also important guides to the crusaders\u2019 identity, activities and terms of participation. Some letters name, or are addressed to, crusaders whose participation is not otherwise known. In May 1219, Pope Honorius III sent a series of letters to Louis of France and leading magnates and bishops in his army, admonishing them to ensure that their impending campaign in Languedoc respected the citizens of Montpellier and the city\u2019s lord, the young King James I of Aragon, since he was a papal ward; the participation of several of these magnates is known from these letters alone.[CITATION-91] Since letters were generally written in response to specific circumstances, those concerning the Albigensian Crusade are also valuable sources for particular aspects of participation in the expedition, as two letters written at either end of the campaigns demonstrate. In May 1208, when the first expedition was being prepared, a letter of Philip Augustus to the duke of Burgundy and the count of Nevers demanded that it should comprise only 500 knights under their leadership and even forbade these two nobles from recruiting anyone except Burgundians: the king correctly foresaw that a large army risked stripping him of potential supporters against his enemies, at a time when his recent truce with the king of England had collapsed.[CITATION-92] The limited Burgundian campaign envisaged by the king of France when the crusade was first being prepared contrasted strongly with the vast, heterogenous armies that marched upon Languedoc in 1209 and so the king\u2019s letter demonstrates how the expedition swelled in popularity as the cross was preached against the heretics across western Europe. Three years after the formal conclusion of the crusade, a letter of Gregory IX stated that he had asked the monks of the Flemish abbey of Saint-Bertin to care for a man who had lost his eyes and a hand in the Albigeois. The pope\u2019s intervention suggests that the unfortunate man had suffered his injuries while fighting for the Church there, and this letter provides details about a particular crusader\u2019s experience that is not available from other sources.[CITATION-93] It can be seen that the documentary sources for the Albigensian Crusade are an important means of identifying crusaders who were not recorded in narrative texts and for showing the impact of their absence in the Albigeois upon their communities at home. They also often reveal otherwise unknown ties between the crusaders. Like the crusades to the Levant, some family groups provided many recruits to the Albigensian Crusade: even if they did not all participate at the same time, their activities over the course of two decades suggest a sustained commitment to this cause.[CITATION-94] As well as ties of kinship, other longstanding associations sometimes lay behind recruitment to the crusade. The western group focussed upon Juhel de Mayenne had been instrumental in the expulsion of King John of England from Normandy and Anjou in the early 1200s,[CITATION-95] and there was a strong overlap between the crusaders against the Albigensians and the men who fought alongside Philip Augustus at Bouvines in 1214 and joined Louis of France in his invasion of England in 1216, including French, Picards and Burgundians.[CITATION-96] Comradeship forged in the various Angevin\u2013Capetian conflicts must have played an important role in recruitment and organisation of the Albigensian Crusade, even before the direct involvement of the heir to the French throne from 1215 onwards. Although the narrative sources sometimes noticed the ties between the participants, others are known only from the documentary records and can be quite unexpected. For example, a letter of Philip Augustus reveals that Roger des Essarts, one of the Norman knights slain at the siege of Le Pujol, had acted as an envoy from the king of France to Hugh de Lacy in the years before Hugh\u2019s revolt against King John in Ireland in 1210. It is tempting to believe that the long-term participation of both men in the Albigensian Crusade owed something to their acquaintance, which presumably dated from before the collapse of the Anglo-Norman realm in 1204 and which was no doubt renewed when Hugh fled from Ireland into exile.[CITATION-97] If the documentary records are an important source for identifying crusaders, they also reveal much about the participants\u2019 understandings of the campaigns. Three aspects in particular have a broader bearing upon the historiography of the crusade and of medieval heresy: the descriptions of the heretics, the designation of the expeditions, and the crusaders\u2019 stated motives for taking the cross.The most common term used today for the heretics whom the Albigensian Crusade sought to eradicate is \u2018Cathars\u2019, but many historians have noted that this term was never used for dualist heretics in Languedoc in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Jean-Louis Biget has argued that the town of Albi, from which the wordderived, was one of several places associated with southern French heresy in the 1140s by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and his Cistercian entourage and that the connection between the Albigeois and heresy was strengthened in the minds of late twelfth-century churchmen by the attempts of the counts of Toulouse to deflect accusations of heresy to the lands of their enemies, the Trencavel dynasty, who were viscounts of Albi as well as of B\u00e9ziers and Carcassonne. Nevertheless, according to Biget, \u2018Albigensian\u2019 did not become the prevalent term for the heretics (and more generally for the Crusade\u2019s opponents) until after the arrival of the first crusading expedition in Languedoc in July 1209, when the reconciliation of Raymond VI of Toulouse with the Church caused the army to turn against Raymond Roger Trencavel instead. The term was subsequently popularised by the crusaders in other areas of Europe but was never used by the inhabitants of the region itself.[CITATION-98] Mark Pegg has taken this one step further by maintaining thatdid not become the standard term for heretics and other inhabitants of the region until 1210 or possibly even 1211, when the crusaders\u2019 chief opponents were resisting Simon de Montfort, now lord of the district of Albi, and the term then replaced an older idea of the heretics as \u2018Proven\u00e7al\u2019.[CITATION-99] In fact, letters and charters indicate that \u2018Albigensians\u2019 and \u2018the Albigeois\u2019 were being used as general terms for the heretics and their country before the first crusading army assembled in June 1209.[CITATION-100] Philip Augustus wrote to the pope discussing whether he might \u2018march against the Albigensians\u2019 in the winter of 1207\u20138,[CITATION-101] and several Burgundian and Champenois acts from 1209\u2014including at least two extant original charters\u2014designated the heretics as, without requiring the term.[CITATION-102] Similarly, the land to be attacked was called the \u2018Albigeois\u2019 or \u2018Albigensian region\u2019 before the first campaign was launched.[CITATION-103] Moreover, the term \u2018Albigensian\u2019 was being applied in a very broad fashion before the crusade began: on 22 June 1209, just before the muster of the first crusading army at Lyon, Count Hervey of Nevers referred to his proposed campaign as the \u2018Albigensian pilgrimage\u2019.[CITATION-104] In the course of the expeditions the charters of departing crusaders would describe the \u2018Albigensians\u2019 with a variety of hostile epithets,[CITATION-105] and the destination of the crusade was usually designated by a phrase such as(with a wide variety of semi-vernacular spellings),or.[CITATION-106] It is true that when the Crusade was launched, some Burgundian charters identified \u2018Proven\u00e7al heretics\u2019 as the target.[CITATION-107] Not only had heresy often been associated with a vaguely defined \u2018Provence\u2019 since the mid-twelfth century,[CITATION-108] but Innocent III\u2019s own calls to arms in 1208 repeatedly named that region as the home of the heresy.[CITATION-109] For a Capetian scribe composing the king\u2019s letter to the duke of Burgundy and count of Nevers in 1208, the targeted heretics were simply \u2018Arians\u2019, a reminder of the anachronistic framework in which heretics were discussed in princely courts as well as theological debates, although such archaic terms were not used in charters.[CITATION-110] Throughout the crusade, some documents also referred simply to \u2018heretics\u2019 as the target.[CITATION-111] Yet such variations appear to have been a matter of scribal preference. In a matter of weeks in June 1209, Duke Odo of Burgundy\u2019s clerks issued acts referring to his forthcoming attack upon \u2018Proven\u00e7al heretics\u2019, \u2018Albigensian heretics\u2019, \u2018Albigensians\u2019 and simply \u2018heretics\u2019.[CITATION-112] Alternatives to the term \u2018Albigensian\u2019 in the crusaders\u2019 charters sometimes show greater rather than less understanding of the religious and political situation in the Midi. In 1212, a judgment of two judges delegate in the diocese of Meaux stated that a third judge, the archdeacon of Paris, was on pilgrimage against heretics \u2018in the region of Toulouse\u2019, at a time when the focus of crusading activity had shifted to the county of Toulouse and the Agenais.[CITATION-113] Similarly, an act of Juhel de Mayenne from 1219 states that he was \u2018setting off on pilgrimage against the Toulousan heretics\u2019, presumably with Louis of France.[CITATION-114] The modest achievement of Louis\u2019s second expedition was an ineffectual demonstration before Toulouse, and Juhel\u2019s act reflects the city\u2019s depiction as the enemy of the Church in the wake of Simon de Montfort\u2019s death before its walls the previous year, not least in repeated papal appeals for new crusaders to shore up the faltering cause.[CITATION-115] Juhel\u2019s act suggests an awareness of the great shifts in the political situation of the Midi since his previous crusade in Spring 1211, when the city and count of Toulouse had still been outwardly aligned on the crusaders\u2019 side, and he had issued acts referring to the \u2018Albigensian heretics\u2019.[CITATION-116] Nevertheless, Juhel\u2019s other acts of 1219 referred to the enemy in conventional fashion as \u2018heretics\u2019 and \u2018Albigensians\u2019.[CITATION-117] Despite the changing political context, the much vaguer (and misleading) term \u2018Albigensian\u2019 remained popular in crusaders\u2019 charters until the very end of the campaigns against the heretics: in 1240, an act of a Flemish knight envisaged his return from a journey to the \u2018land of the Albigensians\u2019, where he was most probably going in order to assist the suppression of the revolt by the dispossessed viscount of B\u00e9ziers, Raymond Trencavel.[CITATION-118] The geographical scope of the \u2018Albigeois\u2019 in charters and administrative records was a much broader region than the diocese of Albi alone: in theand other royal documents, it included places as far apart as Avignon, Castelsarrasin, Termes and Toulouse.[CITATION-119] The documentary sources differ from the narrative sources in an important respect, however, for they did not always use the termnegatively. In 1219, an act of the bishop of Laon stated that the knight, Guy de Monceau, had taken the cross \u2018to aid the Albigensian church\u2019.[CITATION-120] The following year, Henry III of England stated that Philip Augustus had renewed the Angevin\u2013Capetian truce of 1214 \u2018for the honour of God, the Holy Land across the sea, and the land of the Albigensians\u2019,[CITATION-121] and soon afterwards, a French royal letter referred to the levy which the countess of Champagne had raised \u2018for the subsidy of the Albigensian land\u2019.[CITATION-122] The will of Queen Ingeborg of France (1218), a letter of Archbishop Peter of Sens (1221), and a charter of Odo de Ponches (1226) all likewise promised to \u2018aid the land of the Albigensians\u2019.[CITATION-123] The non-narrative sources therefore reflect the elasticity of the concepts surrounding these terms, a quality that helped to fix the land and its inhabitants in Christian minds across western Europe.The documentary evidence is also valuable for contemporary views of the nature of Albigensian Crusade and hence for our understanding of the crusaders\u2019 purported motives. As various charters cited above have demonstrated, from the very first campaign in 1209 these documents frequently described the expeditions in the language of pilgrimage, using nouns such as,and, or the adverb. Hence, Theobald, count of Bar(-le-Duc) and Luxembourg, arranged the division of his inheritance at Easter 1211 \u2018when, for the love of God, we had taken the sign of the holy cross against the Albigensian heretics and were about to set off on our pilgrimage\u2019.[CITATION-124] On his deathbed three years later, the count\u2019s revised will referred to the division that he had made while preparing for the \u2018way of the Albigensians\u2019.[CITATION-125] These documents are very important for indicating how the participants understood the expeditions which they joined. Crusades to Jerusalem had frequently been depicted as pilgrimages ever since 1095, although historians disagree whether or not crusades and pilgrimages were considered as distinct forms of spiritual activity in the twelfth century.[CITATION-126] The nature of crusading was radically altered when Jerusalem fell once more into Muslim hands in 1187: thereafter, a more distinctive language for expeditions to recover the Holy City emerged, designating the holy warriors by new terms such asand its vernacular equivalents, although ambiguities remained and the language of pilgrimage continued to be used for expeditions which had the Holy Sepulchre as their goal.[CITATION-127] It was a major ideological step to transfer the ideologies of crusading to a campaign against inhabitants of a Christian kingdom.[CITATION-128] In the later twelfth century, when military action against heresy in southern France was first mooted, the papacy promised spiritual rewards, but these did not match the benefits offered to crusaders to Jerusalem. However, Innocent III progressively augmented the spiritual benefits to be gained by suppressing heresy: in 1198, he put any future campaign in Languedoc on a par with a pilgrimage to Rome or Compostela, whereas by 1204 he was promising the king of France the much greater privileges of a crusade to Jerusalem if he would provide military assistance to the papal legates in their efforts to eradicate heresy, and by 1207\u201308, he was extending these privileges to all the Christian faithful.[CITATION-129] When the crusade was launched, Innocent III recognised the participants as\u2014which was also the most common term used in the charters, and one accepted even by the opponents of the crusade\u2014or as, but he only rarely invoked the language of pilgrimage.[CITATION-130] Papal letters more commonly described attempts to root out heresy in Languedoc in quite different language, as \u2018the business of peace and faith\u2019 ();[CITATION-131] variants of this epithet were also much used by Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay in hisfor both the preaching before the crusade and the campaigns themselves.[CITATION-132] The chief narrative sources for the Albigensian Crusade accepted that its participants were crusaders, but were more ambivalent about their status as pilgrims. After describing the initial expedition, Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay\u2014himself a participant in the crusade between 1212 and 1218\u2014used the termmainly for the short-term crusaders,[CITATION-133] as did the much later chronicle by William of Puylaurens;[CITATION-134] the principal vernacular source, the, always referred to the crusaders as, except when its hostile anonymous continuator used the term(\u2018stave-carriers\u2019), a derogatory term for pilgrims also noted by Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay.[CITATION-135] As Christopher Tyerman has noted, theitself provides some of the best evidence of the clearer distinction between crusading and pilgrimage in the early thirteenth century, since it uses a distinctive vernacular term,, for the expedition, rather than calling it a pilgrimage.[CITATION-136] The popularity of the language of pilgrimage in the charters is therefore very striking. They provide powerful evidence for the persistence of the idea among the aristocracy of Latin Christendom that crusaders against heretics were \u2018pilgrims\u2019 on a \u2018pilgrimage\u2019. Since the expedition had no obvious shrine as its destination, the notion of the expedition as a pilgrimage shows that the \u2018pilgrims\u2019 conceived of the expedition primarily in terms of the promised spiritual benefits that put it on a par with the armed pilgrimages to Jerusalem.[CITATION-137] The emphasis upon pilgrimage also had substantial implications for the viability of the enterprise. It reflected an expectation among the participants that they would be absent for a short time and return. Most of them clearly had no intention of settling in the Midi, despite Innocent III\u2019s promise of the confiscated lands of heretics;[CITATION-138] and the expedition\u2019s lack of a clear geographical goal would prove an enduring obstacle to its success, as the participants were drawn into an ever-broader struggle to control southern France.The language of the charters also responded little to the vicissitudes of papal policy over the course of the Crusade. For instance, in January 1213, Innocent III suspended the privileges of the crusaders, effectively bringing the Albigensian Crusade to a formal halt: he was responding to pressure from the king of Aragon and southern French nobility, and he wished to further his ambitions for a new crusade to Jerusalem as well as to prepare to counter a possible Islamic response to the Christian victories in Iberia the previous year. Innocent renewed this suspension in April, although his pronouncements over the next couple of months were more ambivalent and left room for recruitment in the south of France and further military action by Montfort\u2019s forces.[CITATION-139] Yet, these shifts in papal policy had no impact upon the language of the charters. In June 1213, a charter of the Champenois magnate Erard de Brienne stated that he was \u2018about to set off on the Albigensian pilgrimage\u2019,[CITATION-140] and in August the bishop of Toul in Lorraine confirmed a grant of a \u2018crusader against the Albigensian heretics\u2019, with provisions in case he died on his.[CITATION-141] The degree of similarity between the phrases expressing these pious motives is also remarkable: although there was much variation, some phrases, such asand, occur repeatedly. It is possible that the common discourse of the crusade revealed in the charters was related to the preaching of the expedition and to the distribution of recruiting letters through the Cistercians, Premonstratensians and, eventually, the new mendicant orders.[CITATION-142] Unfortunately, no sermons promoting the crusade survive before Louis VIII\u2019s third expedition in 1226. For that campaign, homilies such as Odo de Ch\u00e2teauroux\u2019sare primarily biblical commentaries. The only extant sermon concerning the Albigensians by the most famous of the preachers, James de Vitry, refers to them as \u2018Patarenes\u2019, a term never found in crusading acts, and it was not redacted until the mid-1230s.[CITATION-143] As for, this phrase is found in only a few acts emanating from or concerning crusaders, all of them from the final stages or aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade and mostly issued by senior clergy, although the phrase can also be found in French royal acts.[CITATION-144] The language of pilgrimage remained the most popular way in which charters accounted for participation in the campaign of 1226,[CITATION-145] even though by then many of the participants were serving expressly at royal command.[CITATION-146] If the charters proclaim a common view of the expeditions against the Albigensians as pilgrimages, the standardised nature of their clauses cannot reveal individual motives, for the crusade rapidly took on a normative quality as an option for pious or penitential action. In or soon after 1209, the elderly Breton nobleman Alan fitzCount took his young son Henry to Paris to do homage to Philip Augustus.[CITATION-147] At an inquest in 1235, a juror reported that he had heard Alan afterwards declare, \u2018Now I can indeed go to the Albigeois or, for [my son] is the lord king\u2019s man for all my seisins\u2019.[CITATION-148] The Church was soon prescribing participation in the Albigensian Crusade as a standard form of penance. Pilgrimage had been used as a form of public penance for centuries, and crusades had consequently served a penitential purpose since their inception;[CITATION-149] but in the early thirteenth century, the taking of crusading vows was becoming a standard penance for penitent aristocratic sinners, while the penitential character of crusading was receiving greater emphasis in sermons. Despite the spread of private confession, public penance remained popular, and there were few more visible acts of repentance than departure on crusade.[CITATION-150] Indeed, the Church sometimes required those opposing the Albigensian Crusade to serve a fixed term in the Holy Land in atonement: most notable of all was the unfulfilled promise by Raymond VII of Toulouse to take the Cross against the Saracens in Outremer for five years, as part of the treaty which ended the crusade in 1229.[CITATION-151] Yet, charters and letters reveal that the Albigensian Crusade itself became a prescribed destination for penitents. In 1218, Honorius III permitted those who had been excommunicated for assisting Louis\u2019 invasion of England in 1216\u201317 to commute their penance from service in the Holy Land to participation in the Capetian prince\u2019s intended expedition against Toulouse; the pope went on to allow a number of other excommunicates to commute their penances in return for joining this campaign.[CITATION-152] For his complicity in the murder of the abbot of Saint-Michel-en-Thi\u00e9rache near Laon1214\u2014allegedly at the age of only fifteen\u2014Giles de Saint-Michel, the abbey\u2019s advocate (lay protector), was ordered by the Roman Church to fight against the Albigensian heretics.[CITATION-153] By joining Louis VIII\u2019s last crusading expedition in 1226, the Picard baron, John de Nesle, along with his household and retinue, temporarily escaped a sentence of excommunication that the bishop of Noyon had imposed upon them.[CITATION-154] When a quarrel between the abbey of Bonneval (dioc. Chartres) and Hughwas resolved in 1227, the mediators gave Hugh a choice of penances to atone for his offences against the abbey: he could either journey to Rome to seek the pope\u2019s sentence and letters of absolution in person or serve for a year as one of the king\u2019s paid knights in the Albigeois, returning with the written certification of one of the nobles that he had fulfilled these conditions.[CITATION-155] Hugh\u2019s act well demonstrates how, after nearly two decades of converging interests, the concerns of the Church and the French monarchy had finally merged: paid service in the royal army could count as an act of penance.If charters emphasise the status of the Albigensian Crusade as a pilgrimage, the documents of Capetian administration, by contrast, depict its later campaigns as funded royal military expeditions, with little distinction evident in the sources between the last years of the crusade (1226\u201329) and subsequent operations to maintain royal power in the Midi.[CITATION-156] Most of theof 1247 concerning the Albigensian wars were associated with supplying and paying the royal army. Two knights from the border of Normandy and Perche alleged that their horses had perished at the siege of Avignon in 1226 while the knights were serving on royal pay, but neither man had received any compensation.[CITATION-157] Three plaintiffs stated that they had not been paid their full wages for serving in royal armies in Languedoc at various points between the siege of Avignon in 1226 and the campaigns preceding the fall of Monts\u00e9gur in 1244.[CITATION-158] Seven others complained that their horses or carts had been requisitioned in Normandy or Perche for Louis VIII\u2019sof 1226: few of the beasts or carts ever came back![CITATION-159] One knight had paid for his horse, arms and harness out of his own pocket on the royal marshal\u2019s orders in 1228 but received no pay for the thirty-seven days that he served.[CITATION-160] He also stated that while in the king\u2019s service in the garrison of Castelsarrasin, he and several sergeants were forced by hunger to eat a nag of his, worth 15, but he had been compensated only two. William of Puylaurens describes the starving of this garrison by the count of Toulouse in 1228, but theshow that the Church\u2019s forces included recently arrived crusaders from Normandy serving for royal wages as well as more seasoned members of the army of God.[CITATION-161] The Norman depositions of 1247 give a strong impression of the later expeditions as royal campaigns organised by compulsory military summons rather than voluntary pilgrimages, with even noble participants serving for pay rather than for vows taken for the sake of their souls. For the crusade after 1219, historians have had to rely heavily upon William de Puylaurens\u2019 much later chronicle and so theare a useful additional source for that period, and they demonstrate a significant gap between the views of the monarchy and of many of the participants as to the nature and purpose of the crusade.Histories of the Albigensian Crusade have made relatively little use of documentary sources for these expeditions and so they have had little to say about the nature of participation in the campaigns or the identity of participants, especially the forty-day crusaders. Fascinated by the polemical tone and rich detail of the main narrative texts, historians have largely turned to other sources only from the death of Simon de Montfort onwards, but, even then, acts from the South of France and royal and papal archives have been privileged at the expense of charters and inquests from the principal homelands of the crusaders. These are not the only neglected sources for participation in the Albigensian Crusade; so, too, are hagiographies and miracle stories, which offer another set of views of the crusade and the identity of its participants and also deserve separate study.[CITATION-162] Yet, the non-narrative sources offer a useful corollary to, and check upon, the writings of Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay and the. This is well demonstrated by statistics. For the present study, about 430 members of the crusading armies have been identified. The two main narrative sources identify about 220 of these, with at least thirty people appearing in both texts: approximately seventy are known only from Peter des Vaux-de-Cernay\u2019s, and about 120 only from the.[CITATION-163] Charters, letters and inquests mention about 250 participants in the Albigensian Crusade, of whom around forty are named in narrative sources. Hence more than 200 participants\u2014nearly half of the known crusaders\u2014are known from documentary sources alone. As we have seen, they also provide valuable evidence for contemporary understandings of the crusade and of its opponents.We can look at these documents from another perspective. If we consider the body of medieval crusading charters as a whole, the Albigensian Crusade appears as a major crusading experience for the French aristocracy. For an earlier age that was less reliant upon the written word, Jonathan Riley-Smith has identified about 800 certain, probable and possible participants in the First Crusade from narratives and charters.[CITATION-164] For the two most important early thirteenth-century expeditions sent to recover Jerusalem, the Fourth and Fifth Crusades (1202\u20134 and 1218\u201321), prosopographical studies that draw upon a similar range of evidence as this study of the Albigensian Crusade have collected approximately 300 and 1,100 known or possible participants respectively from across western Europe.[CITATION-165] The identification of well over 400 participants in the Albigensian Crusade, nearly half of them from documentary sources alone, places it on a comparable scale to these great enterprises, although it is true that it took place over a much longer period. While the identified crusaders in all these expeditions must represent only a small fraction of the total number of participants, the presence of significant numbers of charters concerning the Albigensian Crusade in the archival collections and cartularies of France testifies to widespread, repeated involvement in the campaigns against heresy across much of the kingdom. Although it is not time to discard theoras the leading sources for this enterprise, an alternative history of the Albigensian Crusade that draws upon these forgotten sources remains to be written.",

Philip\u2019s first letter (no. 1015) was probably responding to a papal letter of 17 November 1207 which had exhorted him to suppress heresy in the county of Toulouse, but that same day Innocent III sent similar letters to the French aristocracy as a whole, as well as specifically to the countesses of Champagne, Saint-Quentin, and Blois, the duke of Burgundy, the counts of Bar(-sur-Seine), Nevers and Dreux and the Champenois magnate Guy de Dampierre (Die Register Innocenz\u2019 III., x, no. 149). Taken together, these papal letters suggest that Innocent was then expecting support against southern heresy to come mainly from the French royal domain, Picardy, Champagne and Burgundy, but the murder of the papal legate Peter de Castelnau by a follower of the count of Toulouse soon after (January 1208) transformed papal efforts into a plan for a more general expedition.",
