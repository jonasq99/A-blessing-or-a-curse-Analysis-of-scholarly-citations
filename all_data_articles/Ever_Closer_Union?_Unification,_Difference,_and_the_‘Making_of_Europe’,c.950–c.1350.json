    "article": "The article explores the relationships between the universal and the particular in high medieval Europe. It notes the enduring appeal of views of the period as being marked by an increasingly unified \u2018European\u2019 culture and explains their modern salience. It observes the parallel phenomena of division and plurality in the period and the prominence of themes of conflict and fragmentation in the following centuries. The purpose of the article is to re-examine the relationship between these seemingly contradictory forms and developments. Its aim is to illuminate and explain the strengthening elements of division and disunity discernible in Europe between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries in terms of the new, over-arching cultural unities which characterise the same high medieval period. Taking as its basis the model of \u2018Europeanisation\u2019 developed by Robert Bartlett, it complicates his picture of advancing homogenisation by demonstrating the ways in which new, encompassing, integrative cultural forms promoted dis-integration and encouraged the articulation and reproduction of difference. The processes of change through which high medieval unities were created were themselves divisive, while strengthened institutions, particularly the Church and papacy, fostered division and provided fora within which contending claims could be negotiated. New, widely disseminated media allowed difference to be more sharply articulated. The cosmopolitan elements in high medieval European culture, the article contends, bore within them the seed of the particular(istic), which ripened together with those same universalising currents. This dialectic of unity and plurality sheds a fresh light on the transition from the central to the later Middle Ages in Europe.The, an ambitious mid-twentieth-century Church history of strongly clerical flavour, concluded its coverage of the thirteenth century on a high note. Under the heading \u2018Christian Unity\u2019, its authors observed with satisfaction how \u2018after the victory over Frederick II [d. 1250] \u2026 there truly exists a Roman Christendom, encompassing all believers in Christ and obedient to the inspirations of Peter\u2019s successors\u2019.[CITATION-1] Antichrist was dead, the heretic emperor and his Hohenstaufen brood beaten for good.[CITATION-2] When the great Church council sat at Lyon, from 1272 to 1274, even the schismatic Greeks appeared ready at last to be reconciled under universal Petrine headship. By then, a century of learned lawyer-popes had defined with precision the unvarying obligations of a Christian life throughout an extended Catholic Europe. Around the same time, St Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274) completed his heroic life\u2019s labour, of binding Aristotle into a secure Christian embrace, reconciling a single creator-God to his single, material, human world.[CITATION-3] History, readers of thewere invited to imagine, had found an end.[CITATION-4] How precipitately History returns. In September 1303, less than three decades after Lyon, a reigning pope, Boniface VIII, was fatally attacked in his own palace by a mob whose number included a chief minister of the (\u2018most Christian\u2019) king of France.[CITATION-5] Reactions, or rather their notable absence, from across \u2018Roman Christendom\u2019 to the assault at Anagni encourage the suspicion that few were greatly shocked.[CITATION-6] By that point the pope had already visibly failed to prevent the French and English kings from taxing their clergy to fund the dynastic, territorial wrangle that would form a prelude to two centuries of endemic late medieval war. In the struggle between pope and kings, many clergy in both realms would side with their monarch. The Church itself was quickly revealed as being in deep crisis, haunted by millenarian terrors and torn between radically different visions of its own proper nature.[CITATION-7] To his many and bitter foes, Pope Boniface was himself an agent of supernatural evil.No longer unity but division at once appears to claim centre stage. By the early fourteenth century, the encompassing theological synthesis completed by Aquinas was already coming apart at the seams. In the political sphere, John Quidort (d. 1306), a French Dominican, drew upon Aristotle to argue that nature, under God, favoured regnal plurality, rather than a single, universal order.[CITATION-8] A generation later, Marsilius of Padua (d. 1342) would celebrate Boniface\u2019s death as the removal of an obstacle to establishing a distinct, secular sphere of government.[CITATION-9] Things fall apart. Medieval Europeans seem to have passed abruptly from a time of relative stability and cohesion to what might fittingly be labelled an age of anger.[CITATION-10] Geoffrey Barraclough, writing in the aftermath of European catastrophe in 1949, was \u2018tempted to wonder whether \u2026 any period of history has more affinity with our own than the age of Philip the Fair\u2019 (r. 1285\u20131314).[CITATION-11] A revolt by the pope\u2019s Sicilian vassals in 1282 had thrown off the Church\u2019s appointed ruler, installing on the island instead an Aragonese kinsman of the accursed Hohenstaufen. The French kings, meanwhile, were embarked upon what might be termed the construction of heaven in one country. For defence of the Holy Land was substituted defence of the sacred soil of France.[CITATION-12] The Templar order\u2014product of the twelfth-century high summer of militant Latin Christian universalism\u2014was suppressed and its assets seized, Jews purged from royal lands, and the Church browbeaten into acquiescence.[CITATION-13] Relocated to Avignon in the borderlands of the French kingdom, the popes themselves fell for a century under French royal tutelage. The rumour, which apparently circulated at the Church council held at Constance, a century after Anagni, of the existence of a French world map with Paris rather than Jerusalem at its centre, by then probably occasioned little surprise.[CITATION-14] It is not only readers of thewho are bound to find themselves ill-prepared for so much sudden falling-out\u2014and for the weary decades of late medieval political instability and endemic war, of social revolt and religious schism, that it appears to herald. For the story of the three preceding centuries has often been recounted, at least on a meta-narrative level, as one of pan-European growing-together. Already by the eleventh century, wide-ranging social, economic and cultural changes were supplying \u2018a more solid basis \u2026 to that unity which men believed to exist in Christian society\u2019.[CITATION-15] From this medieval unity, moreover, a long, enticing path has seemed to stretch ahead towards modern ones. For Jacques Le Goff, the thirteenth century not only represented \u2018the high point of the medieval West\u2019: it was also (implicitly, for that reason) \u2018the time when a model that may, taking a long-term view, be described as European became established\u2019.[CITATION-16] The present essay is hardly the first to point out that the chasm which yawns between the \u2018order and light\u2019 of the thirteenth century and the impending reign of the Four Horsemen is illusory.[CITATION-17] The Good and Beautiful Middle Ages did not end, nor chilly Autumn begin, with the death of Aquinas or the outrage at Anagni.[CITATION-18] But the illusion has served a purpose: to light up with an isolating, beatific glow those elements in medieval culture that successive generations of medievalists have deemed most worthy of illumination. The aim in what follows is to direct that same strong light in a different direction, onto the fractures and divisions always present, and increasingly sharply delineated, but which appear to loom up with (and tautologically to define) the period\u2019s close. Since in the anglophone scholarly tradition these medieval centuries have customarily been termed both \u2018central\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019, the two designations are used largely interchangeably in what follows.[CITATION-19] The essay attempts to show how some of the most salient manifestations of high medieval European unity\u2014cultural forms and genres, emergent patterns of thought, and far-reaching institutions\u2014drove processes of fragmentation, differentiation and boundary-drawing.[CITATION-20] These processes demand a complex explanation, not reducible to a single cause: at their heart, as we will see, lay patterns of social, cultural and doctrinal transformation at work between the tenth and the fourteenth centuries. Notwithstanding these historically specific factors, it will be argued that the interactions of integrative and disintegrative moments observable here also form a useful basis for thinking about unity and division in other complex and changing societies in other periods, including recent ones.The focus in what follows is upon the relationship between power and cultural change, and on the media through which that relationship found expression. Attention is therefore concentrated upon the mainly elite actors whose access to cultural resources has left an articulate record. It is true that the same formative high medieval tensions, between cosmopolitanism and particularism, expanding horizons and local worlds, could also be fruitfully explored by focusing on other spheres of life, such as popular religious practice or changing economic relations. Cultural unities (and their antitheses) do, however, command a special importance, simply because some of the most influential modern judgements on the period have identified unity as its defining characteristic and claim to significance. Tracing the origins of such a view is therefore the first task in what follows. Brief attention is then given to the sharply different priorities which have informed historians\u2019 accounts of the course of social and political power in the period, where attention has instead fallen mainly upon divisions, antagonisms and particularities. The case which this essay then develops, for the role of heightened unities in the construction and articulation of imagined common difference, takes as a starting point Robert Bartlett\u2019s(1993).[CITATION-21] The importance of Bartlett\u2019s thesis here lies especially in the connections which he demonstrates between emergent cultural commonalities and changing structures of power. The essay also adopts Bartlett\u2019s generous chronological bounds, of 950 and 1350, in order to emphasise broad processes of change and to resist an isolating, and thus reifying, view of the period.One of the main impulses behind the systematic modern study of the central Middle Ages, and a major reason for the subsequent exaltation particularly of the period between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries as an early apogee of \u2018European\u2019 achievement, arose from an attempt to find remedies for the perceived evils of the modern nation state. According to the encyclical, issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1879, bad contemporary politics had their root in bad philosophy.[CITATION-22] The solution was a return to good philosophy, and specifically to studying the thought of Aquinas. If the modern European nation state was the problem, the European high Middle Ages offered a solution. It was there that the seminal thinkers were to be discovered who, in an \u2018effort to reunify society\u2019, had looked beyond mere political bounds to discern \u2018a unity of direction, such as guides the revolution of the spheres, the general government of the universe\u2019. For \u2018unity\u2019, as everyone recognised, \u2018is always more perfect than plurality\u2019.[CITATION-23] Pioneering scholarship in the fields of Latinate philosophy, theology and law was the achievement particularly of a number of distinguished Catholic scholars\u2014figures such as Maurice De Wulf (1867\u20131947), Martin Grabmann (1875\u20131949), \u00c9tienne Gilson (1884\u20131978), and Marie-Dominique Chenu (1895\u20131990)\u2014who were also engaged in the contemporary life of the Church, and who staked out the pan-European parameters of their subject.[CITATION-24] Around the same time, between the late nineteenth century and the First World War, Emile M\u00e2le, while concentrating on France, was tracing the embodiment of high medieval religious doctrine in visual forms that reflected principles valid \u2018from one end of Europe to the other\u2019.[CITATION-25] Broadly framed studies of European society, thought and sensibilities in the central Middle Ages multiplied during the middle decades of the twentieth century. This was partly a response to the traumas of the Great War, which had scarred the lives of many mid-century medievalists, often through the personal experience of combat.[CITATION-26] Some must have faced one another across no man\u2019s land.[CITATION-27] Several were devout Christians, whose faith gave purpose to their scholarship, though others, such as Charles Homer Haskins (1870\u20131937), who had attended the Paris peace conferences with President Woodrow Wilson, embraced more secular ideals of general improvement.[CITATION-28] But whether their concern was with law and government, with theology, science, monastic spirituality, the cult of love, or the structure of society itself, they adopted a characteristically European perspective on their subject.[CITATION-29] Or, more precisely, they took a Latin, western European view, reflecting the agenda-setting role of French medievalists (and Anglo-American devotees of the Normans), as well as, for some, the bounds set by the history and Latinate culture of the Catholic Church.[CITATION-30] The idea of Europe itself now emerged as a medievalist concern, reflecting its new-found salience as a frame for contemporary political visions and programmes.[CITATION-31] Some, though certainly not all, turned to the Middle Ages as to Europe\u2019s prelapsarian Eden, a world of freedom before passports and frontier posts,[CITATION-32] whence might be drawn the means of making whole a fractured modernity.[CITATION-33] Many more inter-war medievalists embraced the particular, whether as matter for study (as seen, for example, in a growing interest in medieval nationhood) or, more radically, as an imperative to justify their own work and to urge upon their peers: calls for the \u2018nationalisation\u2019 of scholarship were now heard in some quarters.[CITATION-34] But precisely the proliferation during these years of chauvinistic and inward-looking agendas and viewpoints, reflecting a mood of political crisis and breakdown, acted as a spur to those seeking more optimistic perspectives. Medieval culture, at least among a distinguished\u2014and in the years to come, influential\u2014minority of scholars, seemed still to offer a balm for Europe\u2019s self-destructive nationalisms.[CITATION-35] As one of them insisted, \u2018if our civilisation is to survive it is essential that it should develop a common European consciousness and a sense of its historical and organic unity\u2019.[CITATION-36] The Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, founded in Toronto in 1929 at the urging of Gilson\u2014who had fought at Verdun and spent two years in German captivity\u2014is emblematic of a contemporary current of aspiration.[CITATION-37] By the time of the Second World War, some historians were coming to view the high Middle Ages not only as a reproach to present barbarities but as a harbinger of, and even a potential blueprint for, better European futures. It was at this time that medievalists began increasingly to make claims for the axial importance of their period, and particularly its high medieval centuries, for the course of European civilisation, against the Italian Renaissance as championed by Jacob Burckhardt.[CITATION-38] Medievalists would remake a broken Europe on the page, as politicians remade it on the ground.[CITATION-39] In one of the most influential general histories from the first post-war decade, Richard Southern announced his subject to be \u2018the formation of western Europe from the late tenth to the early thirteenth century\u2019.[CITATION-40] Synthetic accounts of the period multiplied, full of anthropomorphic imagery of Europe\u2019s medieval \u2018birth\u2019 and confident perceptions of \u2018advance\u2019 and \u2018takeoff\u2019.[CITATION-41] Neo-Thomist romanticism faded, but the secular vision which it had done so much to foster, of a European community of culture and solidarity, gathered strength, particularly in continental medievalist writings.[CITATION-42] In some quarters, a more explicitly political note becomes discernible. The Austrian anti-Nazi Friedrich Heer, who had known the terrors of the mid-twentieth century at their sharpest, was in no doubt that \u2018the crises and catastrophes\u2019, but also the \u2018hopes\u2019 (as well as \u2018fears\u2019) \u2018of our own day\u2019, had origins which \u2018can be traced back directly or indirectly to their sources in the high Middle Ages\u2019.[CITATION-43] The Second World War seemed for some only to amplify the lesson of the First, namely, the need for a European political order standing above competing states. Some of the central figures in establishing the first foundations for European political unity took a keen interest in the Middle Ages. At the 1955 meeting of foreign ministers that set in train the creation of the European Common Market, Robert Schuman called upon those present to draw example from the days when Europe was \u2018marvellously bound together in the melting pot of Christendom\u2019.[CITATION-44] In the decades that followed the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the historiography of the central Middle Ages appeared often to be keeping step with successive iterations of European federalism, and occasionally seeking to contribute to debates about its future course.[CITATION-45] A British medievalist felt moved to issue a guidebook to the common European past, to edify the inhabitants of that tardy accession state.[CITATION-46] But such ventures were more characteristic of mainland western Europe, where eminence in the study of the Middle Ages might serve now as a qualification for a role as public educator in shared European histories and destinies.[CITATION-47] By the early twenty-first century, it seemed natural to identify the newly extended bloc of Latin Christian kingdoms at the first millennium as \u2018the first European Union\u2019.[CITATION-48] For historians writing in the post-Communist lands, the \u2018new Europe of the year 1000\u2019 anticipated and legitimised the new Europe of 2000.[CITATION-49] Others went further, claiming that medievalists had a responsibility to draw upon their knowledge of pan-European pasts in order to propose \u2018future-oriented solutions\u2019 to contemporary problems of European unity.[CITATION-50] Indeed, the Berlin medievalist Michael Borgolte insisted that the development of medieval Europe can only be fully comprehended when \u2018the modern Europe-discourse is embraced [by scholars] not as a burden but as an opportunity for better insights\u2019. \u2018In medieval Europe for the first time \u2026 there began the perpetual, interminable endeavour to make unity out of multiplicity\u2019.[CITATION-51] The emphasis placed by post-war histories upon the wide, unifying scope of high medieval culture caught a contemporary mood. In the twelfth century in particular, it was argued, \u2018Europe had the character of an open society\u2019, within and across which ideas and people moved largely free of impediment.[CITATION-52] It was a century in which, for example, \u2018the European book\u2019 appeared as an identifiable phenomenon.[CITATION-53] Intellectual reputations, too, were being made on a \u2018Europe-wide\u2019 stage.[CITATION-54] The world of Latin letters \u2018was in every sense of the word a supra-national movement, forming a republic of teachers, thinkers and writers\u2019, and giving birth to \u2018a supra-racial, yet wholly homogeneous culture\u2019.[CITATION-55] \u2018Scholastic humanism\u2019 was supplying a foundation for \u2018the unification of Europe\u2019.[CITATION-56] It therefore appeared entirely understandable when, in the context of the debates that followed the United Kingdom\u2019s 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union, one media historian took to Twitter to declare the central Middle Ages as having been \u2018like a Remainer paradise\u2019.[CITATION-57] Footloose and well-networked twenty-first-century academics needed little encouragement to seek their putative medieval forebears.[CITATION-58] High medieval \u2018Europeanisation\u2019 became a medievalists\u2019 term of art, quickly embraced as suitable for deployment without further explanation.[CITATION-59] Around the turn of the new millennium, accounts of the period were riding the broader tide of transnational history, with its insistence on the primacy of movement and exchange, on the fluidity and negotiability of all identities, and on the historical insignificance of borders.[CITATION-60] Such transcultural medieval perspectives were bound, moreover, to have a heightened utility, \u2018should the European unification process develop successfully\u2019.[CITATION-61] Characteristically, writings in this spirit continued to focus upon a fairly narrowly drawn Latin Europe and, within its bounds, on key cultural centres: the schools of northern France, the universities of Bologna and (particularly) Paris, the \u2018proto-modern\u2019 bourgeois urban culture of northern Italy, burgeoning commercial networks, and above all, the reformed Catholic Church under its papal heads. It was the Church that had \u2018everywhere created agencies or mechanisms to fortify the sense of cultural identity of Latin Europe\u2019.[CITATION-62] Most such work continued to concentrate upon Christian society. But even a dissenting voice, urging a fuller integration of Judaism and Islam into high medieval European histories, was firm about the importance of focusing only upon the three monotheisms, to the explicit exclusion of surviving medieval European paganisms, as the viewpoint most conducive to cultivating broad (future) unities.[CITATION-63] If the mood of many post-war histories was utopian, there was room for dystopian visions too, recounting how newly ascendant clerical and (as courtiers) quasi-clerical elites extended their power by stigmatising and persecuting perceived rivals.[CITATION-64] Antisemitism, too, was attendant at \u2018the birth of Europe\u2019.[CITATION-65] Not in doubt, however, was the general scope and importance of the changes under way.Unity has never, of course, appeared to most historians as the most interesting thing about the European high Middle Ages. The period seems to reveal many separate, not least \u2018national\u2019, lines of development, and the majority of writers have always focused upon these. Trans-European unities play at best a secondary role in studies concerned with the hard materialities of social, economic and political change at the turn of the first millennium and in the two centuries that followed. It was those material changes that Emmanuel Macron had in mind in his warning to fellow Europeans, sounded in his 2018 acceptance speech for the tellingly named Charlemagne Prize, not to pursue a \u2018Lotharingian\u2019 course of \u2018extreme division\u2019.[CITATION-66] The nightmare scenario invoked by the French president is a familiar one, of post-Carolingian political fragmentation, governmental collapse, feudal \u2018mutation\u2019, and endemic violence and competition.[CITATION-67] The reality, extent and character of these millennial transformations continue to inspire a large and contentious historiography.[CITATION-68] What they make plain, however, is that high medieval Europe\u2019s cultural unities had no counterpart in the political sphere. On the contrary, it was in precisely the period between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries that a settled European pattern of multiple regnal polities became embedded and began to gather theoretical legitimacy;[CITATION-69] and, since the nineteenth century, distinguished national schools of medieval history have been founded upon celebrating those attainments. Across the continent, the search for the medieval roots of individual states and nations was up and running, building on organised programmes of source criticism and publication, long before anyone started thinking seriously about European commonalities.[CITATION-70] Ranke and Waitz, the, Stubbs and Maitland, later the progressivist disciples of Haskins: all went in search of the high medieval foundations of their distinct constitutional systems, on European soil or transplanted across the Atlantic.[CITATION-71] The centuries lying between the Carolingians and the Hundred Years War proved rich in heroic \u2018founding fathers\u2019 and \u2018constitutional kings\u2019 to suit both nationalist and liberal visions of common uniqueness and destiny.[CITATION-72] National academies fashioning and reproducing high medieval national histories\u2014Stubbs\u2019sas the Gratian\u2019sof the Oxford History Schools\u2014became the nurseries of succeeding generations of national politicians and administrators.[CITATION-73] Little wonder that their concerns would prove so tenacious.The narrative of Latin Europe\u2019s strengthening political divisions, and of their reflection in the medieval political-cultural imagination, has traditionally been recounted more in parallel than in conjunction with accounts of advancing cultural integration. Some crossovers have, it is true, long been acknowledged and studied. The new learning benefited State(s) hardly less than Church, whether through the increasingly systematic study of law, the application to secular government of other useful sciences, or the stream of future bureaucrats turned out by the schools and universities.[CITATION-74] Yet the cultural traffic has often been presented as piecemeal, limited and one-way. The \u2018[high] medieval origins of the Modern State\u2019,[CITATION-75] with its now-familiar counterpart, the \u2018emergence of European nations in the Middle Ages\u2019,[CITATION-76] still constitutes a largely separate historiographical track, standing apart from the high medieval \u2018making of Europe\u2019 as a cultural phenomenon. The dialectical aspects of the relationship between culture and power, between the general and the particular, during the central Middle Ages have hitherto attracted little systematic reflection.Towards the end of the twentieth century, however, the elements in these disconnected, apparently contradictory, viewpoints on the period began to attain a resolution. Some historians now sought to entangle the grand narrative of high medieval cultural unities with the parallel-track tradition focused on social and political power, divisions, and separate developments.[CITATION-77] The location of these entanglements was often the advancing frontier, where new realms and peoples were received into \u2018the club of Europe\u2019s Christian states\u2019.[CITATION-78] It was at the margins, where the expansionist populations of the western European core lands engaged in new, often violent and oppressive, interactions with indigenous groups, that the Latin learning of the schools and monasteries was deployed by contemporaries to explain, to justify and occasionally to criticise the new state of affairs.[CITATION-79] Older, Christian\u2013pagan dualities were overwritten by new ones, drawing upon rediscovered Antique models and deploying tropes of civilisation and barbarism to differentiate some imagined groups from their neighbours, rivals and victims.[CITATION-80] The mobile high medieval frontier thus appears to unlock a range of complex interrelations, between cultural unities and particular constructions of identity, and between universal norms and divisive acts. It accordingly provides a starting point\u2014although no end point\u2014for the case which the present essay seeks to make.Nowhere have those interrelations been as fully and searchingly explored as in Robert Bartlett\u2019s, subtitled. Published in 1993, the year in which the Maastricht Treaty came into force constituting the European Union and reiterating the Treaty of Rome\u2019s aspiration to an \u2018ever closer union among the peoples of Europe\u2019, its geographic scope uncannily anticipated the EU accessions of the following two decades. In many ways, Bartlett\u2019s book follows the established grand narrative of high medieval European cultural history, as exemplified by his mentor, Richard Southern, just as its title appears to promise.[CITATION-81] The direction of travel is never in doubt: \u2018By 1300 Europe existed as an identifiable cultural entity\u2019.[CITATION-82] Many central themes and elements are familiar, too: schools and universities; texts and literacy; mobile, interconnected elites; new forms of religious life; \u2018European\u2019 culture itself. More novel for a general history in this vein, and important for the discussion which follows, is the harsh materiality of the vision, and the stress not upon harmonies but on conflict and competition.[CITATION-83] The book focuses on a series of interrelated technologies of power, and on their dissemination from the core lands of post-Carolingian western Europe and their application at the mobile frontier. These include texts, ideas, and modes of thought. But Bartlett\u2019s attention is directed primarily at the means of high medieval political and social transformation: armoured knights and stone castles, the inheritance strategies of aristocratic kindreds, heavy ploughs, plantation villages, new towns under written law. Although he has much to say about the construction, experience and enforcement of difference, the main narrative is of homogenisation: of the creation of common cultural forms, through which the colonial margins came, over time, increasingly to resemble Europe\u2019s western heartlands. This is Bartlett\u2019s \u2018Europeanisation\u2019. He is much concerned with the standardised, with the reproducible, and with the encoding of cultural norms in generally recognisable symbols. These elements are also, however, amenable to quite different readings which, while they do not contradict Bartlett\u2019s findings, cast them in an altered light, prompting further reflections.What many of Bartlett\u2019s signs of Europeanisation have in common is the facility with which, precisely on account of their standard elements and ready reproducibility and recognisability, they constructed and communicated difference. Viewed in this way, the Europe \u2018made\u2019 through the transformations which Bartlett recounts had the character of a broader and more regular symbolic field, on which multiple protagonists could readily construct and display their identities and challenge neighbours and rivals. The point is illustrated by some of his key artefacts of pan-European homogenisation: coins, sealed documents, saints\u2019 cults, and personal names.Coins establish their trustworthiness as a medium of exchange through their regular, stereotypical appearance. Bartlett shows how they proliferated in the central Middle Ages by imitating pre-existing models. Yet coins also function as what Michael Billig, writing about modern societies, has termed \u2018unwaved flags\u2019 of collective identity, subliminally linking those who handle them to the imagined communities which they represent.[CITATION-84] Around the mid-tenth century, the dukes of Bohemia, one of Bartlett\u2019s cultural receptor-realms at the edge of his expanding Latin Europe, began minting silver pennies based on English models.[CITATION-85] But within a century these had been adapted to show the image of the Bohemian patron, St Wenceslas, on the reverse, in a manner visibly paralleling the duke\u2019s image on the obverse.[CITATION-86] Coins thus brought the political community, identified with the Bohemian people, and its supernatural guardian unmistakably into conjunction. When need arose, their imagery was capable of elaborate manipulation to invoke a sense of regnal solidarity, focused on the issuing ruler. The gold \u2018nobles\u2019 minted in England from the reign of Edward III (1327\u20131377) onwards, in a time of war with France, spoke a visual language of defiance and defence: the king was shown on board ship with an armorial shield, guarding his insular realm with drawn sword.[CITATION-87] Iconographic stability mattered too, of course, and often\u2014particularly in times of political flux and upheaval\u2014rulers and regimes opted to take over unchanged the monetary styles and motifs of their predecessors.[CITATION-88] Nevertheless, it was precisely the standardisation and interchangeability of coins that made them ideal matrices within which to construct visible claims to collective particularity and distinction.[CITATION-89] In becoming more alike, European realms and their populations became more identifiably different.The central role which coins attained between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries in the everyday economic transactions of wide and varied social strata lent them a unique symbolic power to represent the regnal community.[CITATION-90] Monarchical and other governments came during this period to assert increasingly comprehensive powers over the circulation of precious metal, particularly in the form of coin, within their territories and over its movement across their frontiers. As aspiration, and by the later Middle Ages to a significant extent in fact, the circulation of regnal currency mapped the bounds of the regnal community.[CITATION-91] The integrity of the coinage came to be viewed as materially and symbolically inseparable from the integrity and health of the commonweal. Collective distinctiveness and distinction were thereby encoded in a ubiquitous, classless, standardised disc of metal.[CITATION-92] Seals are highly comparable to coins, and their iconography was interchangeable, although the (standardised) variety of seals was even greater.[CITATION-93] Their development during the eleventh and twelfth centuries has been linked to contemporary learned speculation about the nature of identity itself and the construction of boundaries against others.[CITATION-94] A striking example of their capacity to articulate conceptions of political community is provided by the seals of the councils of Guardians that governed the kingdom of Scotland during interregna at the end of the thirteenth and early in the fourteenth centuries. These included emblematic portrayals of the kingdom\u2019s patron, St Andrew, crucified in the form of the saltire.[CITATION-95] Seals did not only assert boundaries but could stridently announce their remaking. King Philip VI of France (r. 1328\u20131350) was reportedly reduced to feverish silence at the sight of the great seal of his Plantagenet competitor, Edward III, quartering the French lilies in sign of Edward\u2019s claim to the French throne.[CITATION-96] The royal documents which seals authenticated, and whose European proliferation Bartlett also charts, likewise expressed the particular titles and claims of their issuers. The limited and bounded community of their addressees was further emphasised by the practice, increasingly widespread by the fourteenth century, of issuing such documents in the regnal vernacular.[CITATION-97] The increasing trans-European homogenisation of personal names, fostered by the rise of universal Latin Christian saints\u2019 cults and by the cultural assimilation of new subjects of foreign conquerors to their rulers, was not, as Bartlett himself makes clear, the whole story. Indeed, directly contrary processes were also at work, as incoming elites sought to appropriate the particular sacred pasts of their new realms in order to affirm their right to be there. If the Conquest of 1066 was followed by a proliferation of Williams among the English peasantry, within two centuries the Old English Edward had laid what would prove to be a durable hold upon the royal dynasty itself, reflecting Henry III\u2019s veneration for the Confessor.[CITATION-98] In the fourteenth century, that most western European of aristocratic families, the francophone Luxembourgs, as newly installed kings of Bohemia, began naming their heirs after the Slav martyr-prince Wenceslas and fostering his cult throughout their far-flung domains.[CITATION-99] Frontier nobilities with their origins in Bartlett\u2019s Carolingian European \u2018core\u2019 needed little encouragement to accommodate themselves to the many particular cultural worlds at high medieval Europe\u2019s mobile margins. Such solicitude was clearly wise: indigenous protector-saints could not be counted on meekly to accept foreign takeovers but might, particularly at moments of open conflict, offer themselves as rallying points for nativist resistance.[CITATION-100] Saints possessed throughout the Middle Ages a special importance, as the universal, supernatural advocates of particular votaries.[CITATION-101] Saintly particularism found political expression in the figure of the saint-king, at his height in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.[CITATION-102] The high medieval shift from a world of local cult-sites and holy men to a Latin Europe united in devotion to the central actors in salvation history brought no change here, but created instead a common field on which to compete for the favour of the most powerful spiritual guardians.[CITATION-103] If the Virgin Mary now cast her protective mantle over all, she might nevertheless be induced to enfold especially firmly a community invoking her particular favour and placing her cult at the centre of its common life.[CITATION-104] By the late Middle Ages, the French and the English were contesting Mary\u2019s special patronage just as they contested lands and titles.[CITATION-105] The heritage of the Israelites themselves now seemed ripe for the taking, as different writers sought to associate their own peoples with ideas of divine election.[CITATION-106] To these could be added other reproducible symbolic vocabularies of difference that developed during the central Middle Ages. One was heraldry. Precise distinction and rigorous comparability are the twin fundamentals of the heraldic sign-system.[CITATION-107] Very soon, therefore, regnal armorials are found being tendentiously evoked, compared and contrasted in order to invest different peoples\u2014the Germans with their bellicose eagles, the English with their ravening lions, the French with their pacific lilies\u2014with supposedly settled collective characteristics, and thus titles and destinies.[CITATION-108] The gothic style, as a visual language of elaboration, delineation and distinction, was well adapted to illuminating and celebrating the particular.[CITATION-109] Already by the thirteenth century, gothic art had attained a startling physiognomic realism that some have linked to emergent learned discourses of race.[CITATION-110] By the late Middle Ages, observers were discerning the lineaments of their own rulers in the carved effigies of sacred figures in their churches.[CITATION-111] Those same rulers were now also increasingly commemorated in tomb effigies, in which some contemporaries claimed to make out their individualised physical features.[CITATION-112] The development of generalised Latin European cultural forms in the central Middle Ages rendered specific group identities more visible, and more amenable to precise and detailed articulation and differentiation. The connections go deeper, however, reflecting the high medieval efflorescence of thought and learning and the new social and institutional loci for their pursuit. It was natural that a learned culture increasingly concerned with general and universal principles should also have been preoccupied with distinctions and divisions\u2014as between the parts of a scholastic treatise or, more broadly, between the different orders of universal Christian society.[CITATION-113] Contention, the pitting of this against that, was at the heart of the scholastic programme, a culture of thought reflecting the violently competitive world from which it sprang, and which it served and shaped.[CITATION-114] Every thing is particular, taught Peter Abelard (d. 1142).[CITATION-115] High medieval intellectual training was all about drawing lines. The deadly template of dualist heresy, some have suggested (although not without challenge), was first internalised as a schoolroom exercise in Paris, and only subsequently projected, by the self-same graduate clerics, onto the human landscapes of southern France and northern Italy.[CITATION-116] In comprehending the universal, human difference mattered fundamentally. Studying the whole stirred an impulse to distinguish the parts. The single inhabited world of thewas no undifferentiated mass, but was overlaid with divisions\u2014most primally, those between the different races, descendants of the three sons of Noah and inhabiting the three continents.[CITATION-117] Their separation was marked in clear diagrammatic form. Medieval world maps characteristically gave fullest and most circumstantial account of their authors\u2019 own native regions. On occasion, it has been argued, they might even register a recent local history of ethno-religious purge and exclusion.[CITATION-118] A concern with distinctions is even more evident in the free-standing regnal and regional maps which were a by-product of thetradition. To that end, the St Albans monk-cartographer Matthew Paris (d. 1259) used rivers and estuaries to emphasise visually the borders between Wales, Scotland, and his native England.[CITATION-119] \u2018Medieval humanism\u2019, with its concern for the general in humanity, raised up its own high barriers. Peter the Venerable (d. 1156) wondered whether the Jew, who \u2018does not cede to human reason\u2019, and thus lacked the quality \u2018that separates man from other animals\u2019, should be considered human at all.[CITATION-120] The high medieval scholastification of Latin Christian engagements with their Jewish neighbours generally did little to foster sympathies or sense of things shared.[CITATION-121] Natural philosophy, through which \u2018the human\u2019 was increasingly read and comprehended, exalted the human body as the foundational locus of identity and discrimination. The racialised science and medicine of Antiquity, together with its Arabic commentaries, entered Latin Europe across \u2018open\u2019 high medieval frontiers, physical and mental, to become the familiar stuff of lecture and quodlibet.[CITATION-122] Bodies white, black, and Jewish, their purported distinguishing qualities, and the implications of those qualities, were elucidated by Latin schoolmen in what has been called the \u2018proto-racist shift\u2019 of Europe\u2019s long thirteenth century.[CITATION-123] The manifold differences in human appearance and character, as explained by climatic, humoral and astrological theory, came to engage scholars of the stature of Albertus Magnus (d. 1280).[CITATION-124] A learned lore arguing for indelible human difference now passed freely from the page to the schoolroom to society at large, offering a ready recourse for those with axes to grind.[CITATION-125] Universalising learning bestowed mastery of the particular. Gerald of Wales\u2019s (d. 1223) ethnographies of Celtic Britain reflect his intellectual formation at Paris. Both classical myth and climatic theory helped him account for the eloquence of the Welsh, whose ancestors, he explained, being migrant Trojans, came from a hot land, productive of quick wits.[CITATION-126] \u2018The university\u2019, writes Bartlett, \u2018was one of the most powerful instruments of cultural homogeneity to arise in the Middle Ages\u2019.[CITATION-127] Here above all, it seems, we encounter medieval Europe\u2019s \u2018anywhere\u2019 people, bounded by no frontiers, and always most at home among their own kind. Three-quarters of the regent masters who taught at Paris between 1179 and 1215 came from outside the French royal domain.[CITATION-128] Indeed, the striking thing about the most distinguished masters in the Paris schools of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is how few of them were French. Relocation, it seems, was easy and painless. \u2018Happy the exile which brings such a home\u2019, wrote an \u00e9migr\u00e9 John of Salisbury (d. 1180) from Paris to his friend, Thomas Becket.[CITATION-129] Yet students attending the schools were taught to perceive in one another no nameless multitude, but the offspring of distinct peoples and natives of specific, identifying regions. Rehearsing the supposed common (and usually negative) characteristics of such groups was a staple of schoolroom rhetorical exercises\u2014a practice that does much to explain the wide proliferation of ethnic and regional stereotypes in high medieval Latin literature.[CITATION-130] Recorded instances of actual conflict between student groups reflecting ethnic antagonisms are few and well known, and were over-emphasised in earlier, nationalist scholarship.[CITATION-131] Nevertheless, a schooling in purported ethno-cultural difference was among the shared (or, if we wish, homogenising) experiences that students took home with them.[CITATION-132] Characteristic of the age, moreover, is the sameness of the differences invoked: a standardised, interchangeable currency of boasts and slurs, comparable with other contemporary sign-systems of differentiation.[CITATION-133] By the thirteenth century, the familiar literary tropes were increasingly reinforced by \u2018scientific\u2019 markers of difference, drawing on the new learning of the schools.[CITATION-134] Not even the highest reputations were proof against the rhetorical power of place. The most cosmopolitan of scholarly \u00e9migr\u00e9s had trodden a road from somewhere and were liable to be reminded of the fact by their no less exalted peers. For Otto of Freising (d. 1158), Abelard\u2019s Breton birth supplied a key both to his acute intellect and to his want of everyday common sense.[CITATION-135] Stereotyping grew in step with the growth of learning, the proliferation of its tools, and the peregrinations of its votaries. The twelfth century \u2018discovered the individual\u2019 by discovering the group.[CITATION-136] While the university nations into which masters and students were organised were administrative bodies with mostly only an approximate relation, or none at all, to the imagined ethnic identities of their members, this was not always so.[CITATION-137] On occasion, university administrative structures acted as a framework within which ethnic particularism was strongly reinforced. At Prague in the late Middle Ages, the Bohemian university nation incubated a group of masters with a strong sense of Czech nationhood, who came to argue from within the university for the divine election of their people as reformers of the Church.[CITATION-138] As will become clear later in this article, it was often within the most apparently transnational medieval institutions that the most strident voices of ethnic and regnal particularism found expression. Universities, moreover, came from an early date to be understood as regalian resources, subject to rulers who might regulate them as their own advantage dictated. Frederick II\u2019s foundation in 1224, as king of Sicily, of the university of Naples, which his subjects were commanded to attend to the exclusion of all foreign schools, is a notable, but not unique, example of high medieval academic mercantilism in action.[CITATION-139] Regnal priorities easily trumped freedom of movement. Against this backdrop, the openly national-political wave of expulsions and new university foundations around the start of the fifteenth century appears less a breach with than an acceleration of high medieval trends.[CITATION-140] The results of medieval \u2018Europeanisation\u2019 were not all of one kind. New trade routes, dissolving frontiers and bearing Europeans to new horizons, probably acted as a conduit for the entry into the west of radical religious doctrines, disrupting the Church\u2019s emergent unity and reinforcing regional cultures and identities against the centre.[CITATION-141] The high medieval communications boom supplied a buoyant market in difference. If the crusades famously brought Latin Europeans together, the experience appears to have taught many participants as much about what divided as what united them.[CITATION-142] Universal Christendom\u2019s most spectacular common venture offered numerous opportunities for inter-ethnic conflict, rivalries, grudges and accusations\u2014condensed, in chronicle accounts, into the luxuriating repertoire of Latinate schoolroom stereotypes. It was a Europe of many peoples, each identified by its own distinctive, stereotypical, collective qualities, that the emperor Frederick II summoned to holy war against the Mongols, in an encyclical of 1241.[CITATION-143] New boundary-crossings were fertile in nurturing new boundaries, and in reinforcing existing ones.One aspect of the general explosion of Latin literature that began in the eleventh century was the writing of many new accounts of particular collective pasts.[CITATION-144] The burgeoning interest in history is a central element in the classic accounts of the growth of learned culture in the high Middle Ages.[CITATION-145] Among theologians, a deepening concern with God\u2019s relationship with his creation stimulated new reflection upon its unfolding in time.[CITATION-146] A massive growth in manuscript production, through exchange and copying across a more interconnected Latin Europe, increased the availability of sources from which new works could be written.[CITATION-147] One result was a proliferation of histories, recounting distinct, though usually highly comparable and often intersecting, common pasts. Even chronicles of explicitly universal conception, structured around the reigns of popes and (ancient and medieval) Roman emperors, proved adaptable to tell more particular, bounded tales.[CITATION-148] Almost always, high medieval historians were Latinate clerics. Many were monks, or belonged to cathedral chapters or to the retinues of prelates, though some wrote in the service of princes. The earlier medieval histories upon which they often founded their accounts\u2014Bede\u2019s (d. 735), for example, widely copied in post-Conquest England\u2014already depicted a world of many peoples, with which connections and continuities could now be traced. Also increasingly available were works recounting still earlier histories, including that of the Romans.[CITATION-149] These proved a rich source not only of stylistic templates to emulate but also of models of civilisation and its antithesis, with wide applicability in an age of mobile frontiers, unfamiliar neighbours, and new claims to lordship. The writing of history itself now came to be seen as proof of one\u2019s own (and by extension, one\u2019s own people\u2019s) superior civilised credentials.[CITATION-150] Such sources fed a rich and growing array of accounts of imagined common pasts.[CITATION-151] Often, these included mythologised tales of ancient migrations, through which the history\u2019s subject-people had first occupied, and thereby gained an enduring claim upon, the lands with which they associated themselves.[CITATION-152] Most commonly, the ancient origins traced by high medieval historians lay in the Mediterranean world or the Near East. Most widespread of all was the claim to a common ancestry in bands of migrant warriors exiled at the fall of Troy.[CITATION-153] The Trojan origin myth had already established itself among the Franks during the early Middle Ages.[CITATION-154] But after the eleventh century it was laid claim to by new beneficiaries, thereby becoming a template within which many different, but comparable, tales of collective destiny might be written. With its narratives of migrant kinsmen and their varied fates, it also allowed bonds to be traced, and hierarchical relationships asserted, between different medieval peoples.[CITATION-155] By contrast, the Danish historiographer Saxo Grammaticus, despite writing in a complex neo-Antique Latin, unfolded an account of his people\u2019s origins that made no reference to roots in the ancient Mediterranean\u2014perhaps in order to forestall claims to overlordship by Denmark\u2019s southern neighbour, the emperor.[CITATION-156] As the populations of Latin Europe were drawn closer together, so their historians gained new means both of tracing ties and staking claims to apartness: to each people, its own.A notable feature of the boom in histories recounting ethnic roots is its pan-European scope. The early decades of the twelfth century saw an efflorescence of chronicle-writing, incorporating ethnic and regnal origin stories, which spanned Latin Christendom from Bohemia (Cosmas of Prague) and Poland (the so-called Gallus Anonymus) in the east to the Welsh marches (Geoffrey of Monmouth) in the west. We seem to see here a further manifestation of the general pattern of change traced by Bartlett, reaching to the margins of an expanding Latin Europe: the proliferation and regularisation of extended accounts of imagined difference.[CITATION-157] Especially striking about the new tales of common origin is the role in their creation of perhaps the most significant of all the processes of pan-European change under way at the time: the movement for reform in the Catholic Church. The first known attempt at recounting the origins of a single \u2018German\u2019 people\u2014the result, it was claimed, of a union of several northern peoples in the service of Julius Caesar\u2014occurs in the course of a (vernacular) Life of St Anno of Cologne, probably from the 1080s.[CITATION-158] The, a history of the church and people of Trier begun around the same time, identified Trier\u2019s earliest settlers, in the style of an, as migrants from ancient Assyria.[CITATION-159] In the north-east of England, meanwhile, the Durham monk Symeon was compiling an account of the origins of his monastic foundation which also adopted, and adapted, the forms of an ethnic migration legend. The tale he told recounted the travails and peregrinations of the doughty band of followers of St Cuthbert (d. 687)\u2014the \u2018people of the saint\u2019 (), as he called them\u2014across many generations, from Cuthbert\u2019s original resting-place on Lindisfarne to their eventual settlement at Durham.[CITATION-160] Both theand thecan be read as responses to the contemporary conflict between the reformist papacy and the western emperors.[CITATION-161] Symeon\u2019s probable aim was to instil a sense of deep, legitimising continuity in his Benedictine community, established just two decades before in troubled times, reflecting the stresses of the Norman takeover as well as reforming currents in the Church at large.[CITATION-162] Troubling general change spurred a search for reassurance in specific common roots.[CITATION-163] The development of European literatures in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries brought not only the further multiplication of ethno-regnal histories but an extension of their audiences, as vernacular languages became increasingly important both for translation from the Latin and for the composition of new works. Particular histories in a universal tongue were augmented by particular histories in particular tongues.[CITATION-164] The Old Norse kings\u2019 sagas, composed in Iceland and Norway between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, recounted the origins of multiple regnal populations under their ruling dynasties.[CITATION-165] By the thirteenth century, across the North Sea, Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019shad already inspired verse histories in both Anglo-Norman French and Middle English.[CITATION-166] The German-vernacular, compiled in the mid-twelfth century as an ambitious account of imperial history, included a more developed version of the German origin myth first formulated by the.[CITATION-167] Vernacular histories reflected and gave expression to the diversities of an expanding high medieval Europe. Some of them also shed a light upon the resulting tensions and conflicts, occasionally giving a voice to groups who saw themselves as victims of expansion and conquest, or who feared the social changes that resulted. The Middle English chronicle of Robert Mannying, dating from early in the fourteenth century, identified its intended audience explicitly as \u2018the common man\u2019: those who \u2018live in this land\u2019 and who know \u2018neither Latin nor French\u2019. Mannyng explains to them how it came about that the English, who \u2018once were free\u2019, \u2018fell into servitude\u2019; with the coming of the Conqueror, \u2018we lost our freedom forever\u2019.[CITATION-168] Around the same time in Bohemia, an author who became known as \u2018Dalimil\u2019 produced a Czech-language translation of theof Cosmas of Prague, with some significant additions of his own. Writing for a (probably noble) Czech readership at a time when immigrant German speakers were a prominent, and in some quarters resented, presence at court and elsewhere in the realm, the chronicler offered a reading of the Bohemian past outspokenly hostile to what he claimed was the historic role of German influence.[CITATION-169] The cultural artefacts of Europe\u2019s high medieval \u2018making\u2019 thus chart, and probably on occasion contributed to, the fractures and quarrels resulting from that process.It was precisely the most \u2018universal\u2019, pan-European cultural currents of the central Middle Ages that did most to give voice, and a more explicit form, to the identities, claims and titles of many communities. A \u2018Europeanising\u2019 Europe opened routes and channels for a traffic in imagined difference, and summoned buyers to market. No less important, however, is the way in which general changes did not merely facilitate butthe process. High medieval European unity was from the start a divisive unity.[CITATION-170] This is exemplified by its standard-bearer and prime achievement: the reformed Latin Church under a new style of pope.Fundamentally important to the development of high medieval European identities was the \u2018investiture contest\u2019 of the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries.[CITATION-171] This dispute, which broke out during the reign of the emperor Henry IV (r. 1056\u20131106), was ostensibly concerned with the powers claimed by monarchs to install (\u2018invest\u2019) prelates in office. But behind the immediate quarrel lay more fundamental questions: about the access that secular rulers should have to the Church and its property, and about the proper place of those rulers (and other laypeople) relative to the clergy within a Christian world order. The familiar view of the period, stressing the emergence of an increasingly unified Latin Christendom, naturally has merit: at least among a small Latinate elite, there now emerged an interconnected political public such as had not been seen before in post-Roman Europe.[CITATION-172] The investiture contest as a historical moment was both facilitated by, and in turn further stimulated, the development of new, more extensive ties and exchanges. But, partly for that reason, it was also divisive in a way that was without medieval precedent. \u2018The popes, the bishops, the kings, the dukes\u2014all are doubled\u2019, lamented an Augsburg annalist.[CITATION-173] Here too, the easy imprecisions of times past were yielding to a world of red lines.[CITATION-174] Henry IV\u2019s excommunication by the pope, the first such act against an anointed monarch in the Middle Ages, marked the crossing of a threshold.[CITATION-175] Henceforth politics became increasingly a matter of principle, requiring the taking of sides.Nothing divided like universal institutions, as a glance at any historical atlas makes plain. What the most politically fragmented landscapes of high medieval Europe\u2014Italy north of Rome, southern and western Germany\u2014had in common was proximity to the power centres of monarchical regimes proclaiming general jurisdiction: the papacy and the western emperors. Other factors were naturally also important in producing the intensely localised, polycentric political landscapes of these regions\u2014notably, the advanced state of their economic life, and the resulting intensive urbanisation and inter-urban competition. But the papal\u2013imperial struggle was crucial, holding out the prospect of guarantees of independence, underpinned by written charters, to those proving loyal to one side or other. It was a potent enough engine of division to set communities not only against their neighbours and lords but against themselves, as local factions formed, championing the cause of Church or Empire.[CITATION-176] The investiture contest inaugurated more than two centuries of endemic, periodically bitter, conflict between the putative heads of Latin Christendom, popes and emperors. Over that time, the communications media at the disposal of western Europeans, and particularly of the Church itself, grew notably in reach and sophistication.[CITATION-177] But far from smoothing away differences and fostering understanding, the quickening circulation of news, opinion, rumour and misinformation (between which medieval people could no more readily distinguish than can their postmodern successors) tended to stir and reinforce partisanship.[CITATION-178] Matthew Paris was able from remote St Albans to follow blow-by-blow the course of the bitter parchment war between the popes and the Hohenstaufen Frederick II, copying into hissuccessive denunciations issued, for wide circulation, by both sides.[CITATION-179] In this case, a major effect of the communications revolution often identified with the thirteenth century was to rally supporters behind increasingly extreme positions for or against emperor or pope, each now denounced by his enemies as an agent of apocalyptic malevolence.[CITATION-180] The English Benedictine Matthew, who believed that hisFrederick had died a penitent Christian, reported avidly a post-mortem vision in which the emperor\u2019s nemesis, Pope Innocent IV, was subjected to a terrifying divine judgment.[CITATION-181] Accounts of high medieval Europeanisation cannot settle merely for tracing the wide travels, experience and knowledge of thirteenth-century Europeans. How those expanded horizons helped to nurture the distinctive, intensely partisan, and spatially firmly rooted viewpoint of a Matthew Paris, or of others like him, warrants no less reflection.If Latin Europe was being drawn together in myriad ways under the direction of an increasingly institutionally sophisticated, interventionist Church, the process produced effects not always welcome to the growing numbers touched by it. The voices raised in protest at new general impositions now sometimes made claims to speak for particular regnal populations or framed their grievances in ethnically specific terms. At the start of the thirteenth century, the German-vernacular poet and imperial courtier Walther von der Vogelweide alleged that the pope deliberately kept the Empire weak and divided, the better to fleece his fellow \u2018Germans\u2019 financially. He responded by calling for the seizure of clerical properties.[CITATION-182] Three decades later, England was the scene of disturbances directed against foreign clerics holding rich benefices by papal provision.[CITATION-183] The movement, in which nobles and even members of the royal government were implicated, evidently aimed to drive the privileged interlopers from the realm. It was in vain that Honorius III explained patiently how the government of the Church depended on provisions for non-residents, whose work at the Curia benefited all.[CITATION-184] In England, as well as in Walther\u2019s Germany, the context was that of a realm in which recent events had conspired to allow the Church and its head greater opportunities to exercise influence.The programme of the papally led reform movement, which sought to suppress local customs in favour of standardised modes of religious life, had an inherently strong potential to provoke resistance and counter-reactions. This was heightened when reform came combined with the involvement of foreign clergy and the arrival of alien conquerors. Hadrian IV\u2019s bull(1155), with its denunciation of the Irish as a \u2018rude and unlettered people\u2019, appears to proclaim a case for intervention extending far beyond religious life\u2014and may have proved readily adaptable to make such a case.[CITATION-185] The English chronicler William of Newburgh, writing towards the century\u2019s close, observed with satisfaction how the Anglo-Norman conquest of Ireland had put an end not only to the \u2018most superstitious custom\u2019 by which the native population celebrated Easter, but also to \u2018their own state of liberty\u2019.[CITATION-186] It was an expression of political no less than religious domination when in 1216 the Justiciar of Ireland was ordered to allow no more appointments of Irishmen to episcopal sees.[CITATION-187] Sentiments of collective identity and difference found a voice in the most transnational of the new religious orders. Ethnic categories play a prominent although complex role in the writing of the English Cistercian Aelred of Rievaulx (d. 1167).[CITATION-188] More pungent are the judgements, on the \u2018bestial\u2019 Irish, offered some decades later by a fellow-countryman and white monk (and later abbot of Clairvaux and patron of Parisian scholars), Stephen of Lexington.[CITATION-189] Even the Cistercian trope of making the wasteland blossom might acquire an edge of inter-ethnic antagonism when settler monks, entering the territories of others, were tempted to observe that the wasteland they encountered was a result of the idleness of the indigenous population.[CITATION-190] How the Church reproduced and entrenched ethnic divisions, and stimulated identity-formation, through its own developing institutions can be observed particularly at the frontiers of Latin Europe. Frontier monasteries tended to reflect, and to insist upon, the cultural standards of the settlers\u2014particularly, though not only, when these came as conquerors.[CITATION-191] Some shut their doors to native recruits altogether. Among the complaints addressed to the Curia in 1285 by Jakub \u015awinka, the Polish archbishop of Gniezno, was the claim that the German-dominated Franciscan houses in Silesia admitted \u2018hardly a single Polish brother, or none at all\u2019.[CITATION-192] It did not take long for such behaviour to provoke native responses. St Bernard of Clairvaux recounted how the Irish archbishop and reformer St Malachy (d. 1148) had encountered local resistance to his measures, which included the construction of a stone church. \u2018What has induced you to bring this innovation to our part of the world?\u2019, one critic demanded to know: \u2018we are Irish, not French\u2019.[CITATION-193] Post-Gregorian \u2018Europeanisation\u2019 provoked an assertion, and doubtless stimulated a keener valuation, of the distinctiveness of indigenous cultures. In the Old Czechfrom the fourteenth century, the saint himself miraculously appears, to bludgeon with his crozier German interlopers who have supplanted the monks at his own house.[CITATION-194] With time, nativist counter-movements found expression through the structures of the Church itself. Around the year 1140 Bishop Bernard of St David\u2019s called for the establishment of a Welsh archbishopric on the grounds that \u2018the peoples of our province are distinct in nation, language, laws and customs, judgment and manners\u2019.[CITATION-195] At a synod held in 1285, Archbishop \u015awinka decreed that henceforth no benefice with cure of souls was to be given to priests without knowledge of Polish.[CITATION-196] The foundation charter, issued by Bishop John of Prague in 1333, for an explicitly Czechs-only religious foundation at Roudnice justified the move on the grounds that \u2018experience, master of all things\u2019 showed \u2018other nations\u2019 to have been \u2018exceedingly hostile\u2019 to the Bohemian people.[CITATION-197] But if the institutions and doctrines of the high medieval Church nurtured ideas of political and ethnic separatism partly in opposition to their burdens and strictures and to the perceived oppressions that they facilitated, they also fostered such ideas more positively. Among the new boundaries drawn by the investiture contest were those between emergent realms. The papacy had acted since the early Middle Ages in favour of political pluralism, as the best guarantor of its own independence. But with Gregory VII\u2019s conflict with the western emperor, promoting the vision of a Christendom composed of multiple kingdoms became a weapon against the doctrines of the imperialists.[CITATION-198] While, as we have seen, the day-to-day politics of the investiture contest produced much fragmentation, the popes also fostered regnal pluralism for ideological reasons. France under its Capetian kings was strengthened particularly by supporting the papacy against the Empire, while entirely new kingdoms (notably that of Sicily, 1130) were able to emerge from the wrangles and schisms that the contest of popes and emperors spawned.[CITATION-199] Pope Clement V (r. 1305\u20131314) was declaring no new principle when he observed that \u2018the king of glory formed different kingdoms for diverse peoples according to differences in language and race\u2019.[CITATION-200] At the heart of the Church, the universal Latinate learning of the central Middle Ages played midwife to a late medieval Europe of more deeply entrenched and articulately defensible politico-cultural multiplicity. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries saw the development of an increasingly abstract political vocabulary, enabling political communities to be understood as particular manifestations of general principles of order and rule\u2014more comparable to yet, in consequence, also more identifiably different from one another.[CITATION-201] Roman and canon law came to provide authoritative support for visions of a world of many peoples, laws and polities, despite the theory\u2014now increasingly qualified, or rejected altogether\u2014of the emperor\u2019s sole sovereignty.[CITATION-202] Canon lawyers took the leading part in establishing the view that certain kings were without temporal superior. French scholars highlighted particularly the status of the king of France, although the impetus for the canonist tradition of French independence had come from Innocent III, who noted it as a fact in his 1202 decretal.[CITATION-203] Universal principles might also adorn particular ambitions more directly. Castile\u2019s \u2018philosopher-king\u2019 Alfonso X (r. 1252\u201384) appropriated (and vernacularised) the full panoply of sacral Roman titles and imagery in pursuit of Iberian goals, just as the later Capetians and Plantagenets borrowed from imperial repertoires to serve French and insular ends.[CITATION-204] Sometimes canonists were themselves outspokenly partisan, like the Spaniard Vincentius (d..1248), whose glosses celebrated at length the rightful independence of \u2018noble Spain\u2019.[CITATION-205] Even the Church\u2019s universal lawyers reveal themselves at times as unapologetic \u2018somewhere\u2019 people.It can by now be no surprise to find that churchmen were almost always the most prominent and articulate champions of the rights and status of their own people and of the independence of the kingdom with which that people was identified. Saxo Grammaticus, writing early in the thirteenth century, tells how he composed his Danish history at the behest of Archbishop Absalon of Lund, whose purpose was to establish a basis for the kingdom\u2019s independence.[CITATION-206] During the same century it was Latinate clerics\u2014such as the Paris- and Bologna-educated bishop of Krak\u00f3w and Cistercian monk, Vincent Kad\u0142ubek (1160/1\u20131223)\u2014who urged most eloquently the reunification of the fragmented Polish kingdom under a single Piast monarch.[CITATION-207] In the fourteenth century, friars close to the court of the grand duke of Lithuania supported their prince, in spite of his paganism, in his efforts to maintain independence against the Teutonic Order.[CITATION-208] In some cases, churchmen were moved in part by a desire to bolster their own churches, or those of the realm more broadly, against interventions by ecclesiastical superiors. This no doubt helps to explain the notable loyalty of senior Scottish clergy to their king, as their best hope of freedom from the metropolitan authority of York.Their dependence on the protection and favour of monarchs, in whose entourages they were commonly found, combined with their mastery of Latinate learning, made clerics ideal intermediaries between the universal and the particular\u2014and never more so than in the troubled times of the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. The point is well illustrated by writings produced in favour of the Scottish kingdom\u2019s independence from English overlordship and in support of King Robert Bruce, who had ascended the throne in violent and highly divisive circumstances in 1306.[CITATION-209] There exist several documents of clerical authorship which together develop an increasingly eloquent and detailed case for the freedom of the Scottish people under their rightful monarch. All seek their audience at the highest level in the Church. It has been convincingly suggested that the \u2018Declaration of the Clergy\u2019 of 1309\u201310 was composed for the general council at Vienne,[CITATION-210] while others were directed at the pope himself, including the most extensive and celebrated, the Declaration of Arbroath of 1320.Such was the expansion of university studies in the thirteenth century that by the early fourteenth the Scottish clergy included figures of formidable legal learning. Master William Frere, archdeacon of Lothian from 1285 to 1305, had been a regent master of law at Paris.[CITATION-211] Baldred Bisset, prominent in advocating the Scottish cause at the Curia, was a distinguished Bologna canonist.[CITATION-212] The circle around Bruce included churchmen who knew precisely the kind of case suited to find favour at the Curia. It is likely that the Declaration of 1320, with its account of the origins, migrations and struggles of the ancient Scottish people, of their kings and their long and successful resistance to foreign rule, reflected a clear understanding of papal-canonical thinking.[CITATION-213] Specifically, it has been suggested, it sought to present the Scots as meeting the criteria for sovereign independence as adumbrated by Pope Innocent IV (r. 1243\u20131254) in an important pronouncement.[CITATION-214] With its borrowings from Sallust on the nobility of freedom, the Declaration of Arbroath is eloquent testimony to the revived Latin letters and pan-European clerical learning of the central Middle Ages.[CITATION-215] It was also, however, a powerful (and far from exceptional or anomalous) statement of regnal particularity.[CITATION-216] It thus shines a penetrating light upon the paradoxes of high medieval \u2018Europeanisation\u2019. It does so particularly because the Scots were not the only people from the edges of Christendom at this time raising complaints at the Curia about oppressive alien lordship and making appeals to the inherent rights of ethnic groups and realms.[CITATION-217] The thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century popes were the authoritative masters of ethno-regnal difference: no one else possessed, or sought to gain, such a wide and detailed vision of a politically plural world.[CITATION-218] And no one was so often called upon to rule on, and thereby legitimise and affirm, its many boundaries.It has been remarked in relation to modern European nation-making that \u2018there is nothing more international than the creation of national identities\u2019.[CITATION-219] It is the contention of this essay that the relationship between high medieval \u2018Europeanisation\u2019 and the formation and consolidation of many particular group identities is demonstrable in a wide variety of ways, that it deserves closer attention than it has hitherto received, and that its suggestive potential is not confined to the medieval period. Explaining that relationship and its significance means adopting several distinct points of focus.In part, it was simply the case that pluralism was there first, and that the new cultural forms that developed after the turn of the new millennium shone a light on differences of which medieval Europeans were already long aware. Roots went deep. The post-millennium Latinate boom built upon, but also faced competition from, multiple pre-existing vernacular literary cultures, which over time would feed on and ultimately overtake the universal learned tongue.[CITATION-220] The new ways of thinking, writing and feeling worked upon a feudal Europe marked by divisions with their origin in shifts which had taken place in economy, society and political order in the sub-Roman period.[CITATION-221] Writing collective difference was fundamental to the Latinate historiography of the age of Bede and Fredegar\u2014as their high medieval readers and emulators well knew.[CITATION-222] The unificatory projects of the Carolingians were never able fully to assuage these divisions, even in that portion of Latin Europe that fell under their control; and they re-emerged in heightened form with the disintegration of Charlemagne\u2019s empire, and loomed large on and beyond the mobile high medieval frontier. A world of manyandrepresented the settled order for medieval Europeans.[CITATION-223] It is unsurprising that they put the resources of high medieval culture to work describing, justifying and further entrenching that order.But the new cultural tools did not only articulate differences of which people were already aware; they also constructed them. The communications revolution of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, in a manner not unfamiliar from much later communications revolutions, furnished universal media well suited to the propagation of particular and divisive messages. Processes of assimilation across the length and breadth of Latin Europe, reflective of a more mobile and interconnected high medieval world, produced a wide array of standard, reproducible cultural forms, which facilitated comparison and differentiation of unprecedented precision, according to generally acknowledged criteria. Distinguishing and discriminating were central concerns of high medieval learning, reflective of the breadth of its aspiration to understand and describe the created world. Such mental habits drew nourishment from the new texts and ideas that entered the western scholarly canon between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries. Yet the learned culture of high medieval Europe was itself plural and, in its own tensions and divergences, reflected and encoded the conflictual character of the \u2018Europeanisation\u2019 process itself.[CITATION-224] The central medieval centuries were rich not only in new articulations of division but in new divisions, reflecting material contests of existential importance to those involved. The discriminatory habit went beyond mere bloodless description and classification: it had living targets, as new cultural forms were applied to serve power claims. For this reason especially, the universal elements in high medieval European culture carried within them from the start the seed of the particular(istic). That seed ripened as the universal found ever more compelling expression, in the institutions of the Church and in the increasingly ambitious claims of monarchs. The resources of high medieval learning facilitated competition and aggression but were also appropriated by self-defined victim-groups as tools of resistance. In twelfth- and thirteenth- as in early twenty-first-century Europe, the \u2018politics of imitation\u2019 stoked a nativist backlash.[CITATION-225] The institutional consolidation of Latin Europe produced forums, in the kingdoms and particularly within the Church, where conceptions of political identity could be formulated but also contested, and the claims of different groups focused and fought out. In a process that, again, hardly lacks contemporary parallels, transnational institutions became venues for domestic political contests, played for the benefit of domestic audiences. This underlying, strengthening dialectic of singular and plural provides a key to Latin Europe\u2019s seemingly startling transition from high medieval harmonies to late medieval discord.Medieval \u2018Europeanisation\u2019 was paradoxical in character and consequences. The parts of a much-expanded Latin Europe did indeed become objectively more alike in the period from.950 to.1350. And the ways in which Europe\u2019s inhabitants learned to construct and talk about difference also became more standardised and more widely familiar. It is in part reflective of the ubiquity, power and flexibility of those discursive forms and processes\u2014but reflective also of the urgency of the motivations to apply them\u2014that Latin Europeans became during this period such articulate and assiduous narcissists of small difference. This was not an aptitude that, once acquired, Europeans would quickly lose. The central Middle Ages were fertile in imagined difference in ways that accounts of advancing European integration have failed sufficiently to acknowledge. Yet in a way the integrationists are right. For high medieval difference was different from what had gone before: more debatable, more communicable, more self-aware (and self-assertive). \u2018Europe as an idea is falling apart before our eyes\u2019, lamented a group of distinguished writers and intellectuals in a letter sent in January 2019 to major European newspapers.[CITATION-226] In the months and years that followed, pandemic disease and the return of war to Europe would shed a strong light on both the visibility and the vulnerability of borders, on the complex interplay of national bonds and transnational institutions, and on the role of history as a resource for the affirmation and destruction of communities. What the high Middle Ages and the centuries that follow disclose to us is that \u2018falling apart\u2019 (while also \u2018falling together\u2019), far from being a symptom of novel, twenty-first-century crisis, has always been inseparable from\u2014has, indeed, constituted and defined\u2014Europe\u2019s \u2018making\u2019.",

Nelson, \u2018European History\u2019, in Deyermond, ed., A Century of British Medieval Studies, pp. 71\u2013129, at 93\u20134. Bartlett, she notes, in contrast to Southern, with his high-table panorama of great medieval minds, is \u2018happiest when moving on and between Europe\u2019s margins among fellows with more taste for beer than sherry.
