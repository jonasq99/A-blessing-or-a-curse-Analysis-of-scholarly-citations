    "article": "The importance of overseas trade to England\u2019s national wealth and international reputation in the eighteenth century amplified the public discourse on the social value of merchants. Contemporary conduct books described a hierarchical occupational structure, where merchants enjoyed the highest prestige within the business community, with tradesmen and manufacturers performing distinct and progressively less valued professional functions. These conduct books focused on London, England\u2019s premier port and the beating heart of Europe\u2019s commodity and financial markets. Historians have also given much attention to London but have equally demonstrated the importance of merchants in the \u2018outports\u2019, whose participation in England\u2019s foreign trade engendered significant wealth, status and political influence. This article considers a different type of eighteenth-century merchant, one based within English manufacturing regions, and one that has been largely overlooked in the historiography, not least because their businesses elided the separation of production and mercantile activities espoused by contemporary didacts. Focusing on Manchester, the article demonstrates that the town\u2019s \u2018Great Oaks\u2019 challenged London\u2019s commercial hegemony in a distinctive way, seeking not to replicate outport merchants\u2019 entrepreneurial verve in risky, multilateral trades, but specialising, as both manufacturers and merchants, in exporting to commercially developed markets, where the ability to supply a precise assortment of locally produced textiles was more important than the capacity to sell imports or to provide financial services to overseas clients. Although little studied, provincial merchant communities were a general feature of the more dynamic English manufacturing regions in the years immediately before, and during the onset of, industrialisation.Manchester \u2026 had been known as a manufacturing town, the members of which composed of the great oaks of the forest that had rendered our wooden walls sofor centuries past, thatcould meet them with impunity!\u2014they were the(for all those great merchants were manufacturers with scarcely an exception) whose rich assorted bales, containing the second necessaries of life \u2026 gave these manufacturing merchants a sort of princely rank in the country.[CITATION-1] Research on England\u2019s overseas trade in the eighteenth century has emphasised the significance of the merchant communities of London. Economic historians have highlighted the London merchants\u2019 predominant share of England\u2019s international trade, while social historians have demonstrated that merchants dominated civic life in the capital, constructing a primarily urban culture, wherein decisions about investments, marriages and political offices were motivated as much by the concerns of business and the City as by the acquisition of \u2018gentle\u2019 status.[CITATION-2] However, it is now also recognised that provincial merchants based in the \u2018outports\u2019 captured a succession of overseas markets from London in the eighteenth century, when the elite Atlantic merchants of Bristol and Liverpool built fortunes and legacies comparable to their metropolitan equivalents.[CITATION-3] The collective endeavours of these outward-looking, port-based merchants are often portrayed as integral to some of the most important developments in eighteenth-century England: the expansion and integration of its empire; the growing power and reach of its political and financial institutions; and the increasing sophistication of its consumer cultures.[CITATION-4] Historians, in contrast, have paid much less attention to merchants in thetowns of England\u2019s industrial north and midlands.[CITATION-5] This article, which offers a new study of merchants and overseas trade in eighteenth-century Manchester, seeks to demonstrate that the focus on London and outport merchants has not only produced a rather narrow conception of the eighteenth-century merchant community, but has also obscured the scale and significance of a major expansion of direct overseas trade radiating from the provincial manufacturing centres in the second half of the century. While inland merchants based in industrial towns may not have controlled vast fleets of ships, or have invested heavily in appetising or eye-catching consumer imports, they were able to exploit their local contacts in rapidly maturing provincial markets for specialist manufactured goods to make inroads, at the expense of port-based merchants, into some of England\u2019s foremost export trades. The expansion of direct trade from the inland manufacturing regions was not a simple response to industrialisation, but part of a broader process of innovation\u2014in products, markets and technologies\u2014that took root in the 1760s and 1770s, and rapidly accelerated in the last two decades of the century.Although the Lancashire cotton industry was the most dynamic English manufacturing region in the second half of the eighteenth century, and has been the beneficiary of generations of historical research, it has been mainly studied as a pioneer of mechanised, factory production, with little emphasis placed on the marketing systems or personnel that channelled unprecedented quantities of English-manufactured cottons to international consumers. Two main factors explain our limited understanding of the commercial organisation of the eighteenth-century cotton industry. First, from a conceptual point of view, historians of the cotton industry have often portrayed marketing developments as less significant than, or even subordinate to, advances in production, emphasising the impact of industrialisation on merchants and trade but ignoring, or over-simplifying, the impact of widening markets and mercantile innovations on technological change. Douglas Farnie even complained of \u2018a strong anti-commercial bias\u2019 in the historiography of the cotton industry, with merchants relegated to \u2018the rubbish bin of history\u2019.[CITATION-6] Secondly, and more importantly, the primary sources that underpinned the classic industrial histories of northern England yielded limited evidence on commercial organisation before.1815. Despite historians\u2019 best efforts, conventional industrial history sources have not generated a deep enough pool of information to identify the personnel responsible for handling England\u2019s exports of cottons or the business practices they adopted in this period. In contrast, historians have made much use of the abundant and informative sources on nineteenth- and twentieth-century cotton-textile marketing, a system of trade which is now well understood.[CITATION-7] The few studies that have seriously investigated the marketing of English cottons in the eighteenth century have offered more reliable guides to the internal rather than overseas trades in cotton textiles,[CITATION-8] while more recent work on retailing and dress has offered a sophisticated portrayal of the use of imported and domestic cottons in England and the marketing channels that connected manufacturers with their metropolitan and provincial consumers.[CITATION-9] Recent years have also witnessed renewed interest in the merchant networks that distributed an increasing share of English industrial output to international markets in the eighteenth century. However, this research has so far focused on London and the outports and has little to say about the emerging overseas trades of Manchester or other manufacturing towns.[CITATION-10] Even attempts to reassert the importance of Atlantic trade to the genesis of the \u2018first\u2019 industrial revolution have relied more on a demonstration of growing external demand for cottons than on an analysis of the merchant networks that might have transmitted demand signals to putative inventors or adopters of new technologies.[CITATION-11] Focusing on the Manchester textile market and the town\u2019s emerging overseas trades, this article argues that a significant reappraisal is required of both the English merchant community in the eighteenth century and the role played by provincial merchants in setting the stage for the development of the world\u2019s first industrialised economy. Historians\u2019 portrayals of eighteenth-century English merchants have reinforced rather than challenged the prescriptions of contemporary business conduct books, which suggested that merchants stood at the apex of a hierarchical business community, elevated above manufacturers and craftsmen by their refraining from production, and above retailers and warehousemen by their involvement in international trade.[CITATION-12] The first half of the eighteenth century has been associated with a \u2018revolution of scale in overseas trade\u2019, in which specialist merchants driving large businesses came to dominate overseas trade at the expense of the shopkeepers, wholesalers and craftsmen who had made regular forays into foreign markets in the mid- to late seventeenth century.[CITATION-13] While this pattern of concentration and specialisation has been most definitively established for London and the outports, the only major study of an \u2018inland\u2019 English merchant community in the eighteenth century has suggested that Leeds\u2019s woollen exports were similarly handled by a coterie of specialist merchants, functionally and socially separate from production and producers.[CITATION-14] This representation of merchants as a discrete group of elite overseas traders, however, understates the porosity of the boundaries between manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers and merchants, and does not encompass the full scope of individuals and firms who claimed the title of \u2018merchant\u2019 in the eighteenth century. It does not, for example, capture the activities of \u2018merchants\u2019 handling the mainlydistribution of raw or semi-processed materials\u2014coal merchants, timber merchants, corn merchants and the like\u2014who could be found in any English town of significant size in the eighteenth century.[CITATION-15] Nor does it reflect the dynamism of metropolitan warehousemen, the most successful of whom amassed fortunes that \u2018towered over most of the merchants\u2019 and who offered stern competition to merchants in overseas trade by the mid-eighteenth century.[CITATION-16] This article, however, focuses on a different type of eighteenth-century English merchant, one based in manufacturing towns rather than in ports, and one not yet fully integrated into our understanding of the eighteenth-century merchant community, not least because their businesses elided the separation of production and mercantile activities espoused by contemporary didacts. These inland, provincial merchants were most conspicuous in manufacturing regions whose internal markets had reached sufficient maturity to reduce reliance on London sales and to promote the development of local mercantile agencies. Their increased prominence in overseas trade after.1750, moreover, was a natural extension of the specialisation documented from the early eighteenth century: the more merchants specialised by commodity, or as importers or exporters, the more advantage accrued to firms who focused their energies on the manufacture or sale of specific types of goods. Inland merchants, such as those in Manchester, offered a distinctive challenge to London\u2019s commercial hegemony in the late eighteenth century, seeking not to replicate the outport merchants\u2019 entrepreneurial verve in risky, import-led or multilateral trades, but concentrating their efforts, as both manufacturers and merchants, on exporting to commercially developed European and North American markets where the ability to supply precise assortments of manufactured goods was more important than their capacity to sell imports or to provide shipping or financial services to overseas clients.In short, not only would a better knowledge of Manchester\u2019s merchant community shed new light on the business relations between London, the outports and the provincial manufacturing regions, and their ramifications for the timing and character of economic growth in the world\u2019s first industrial society, but it would also permit a better understanding of the diversities of the eighteenth-century English merchant community and the distinctive ways that provincial merchants, in ports and inland towns, challenged London\u2019s long-held domination of English overseas trade. The foundational evidence is taken from the first seven Manchester trade directories published between 1772 and 1800. These directories\u2019 simple lists of individuals/firms, their occupations and their addresses provide the most comprehensive information available on the size of manufacturing and mercantile cohorts in eighteenth-century provincial towns.[CITATION-17] However, as is well known, the directories\u2019 occupational labels often conceal the complexities of the business functions undertaken by particular firms, especially, in the case of Manchester, their participation in marketing and foreign trade.[CITATION-18] This article contextualises the skeletal information available in directories by drawing on additional sources not significantly exploited by historians of the early cotton industry: the direct evidence on Manchester exporters contained in the archives of foreign merchants trading with England and the overseas-trade petitions organised by the Manchester merchants themselves. Combining these two sets of sources develops our understanding of Manchester\u2019s early overseas trade and merchant community in three particular ways. First, it allows a close inspection of the expansion of the Manchester textile market and its internal workings in the late eighteenth century. Secondly, it permits a detailed reconstruction of the connections that Manchester forged with consumer markets in Britain and abroad, and the identification of the Manchester firms who developed the town\u2019s major overseas trades after 1750. Finally, it enables the emergence of Manchester as a significant trading centre to be understood as part of the wider growth and development of England\u2019s international trade and of its provincial merchant communities and towns in the eighteenth century.Although Manchester became synonymous with cottons, the textiles manufactured in the town and its hinterland in the eighteenth century comprised a heterogeneous assortment of cotton, linen, silk and worsted cloths and accessories known as \u2018Manchester goods\u2019. The town\u2019s first directories, published in the 1770s, highlight the primary importance of three types of textiles sold in the Manchester market: fustians, checks and smallwares, with woollens and silks occupying secondary positions. Fustians mainly comprised stout cotton-linen mixed cloths, as well as higher-value all-cotton \u2018velverets\u2019, designed for men\u2019s waistcoats, breeches and frock coats. Checks, also largely linen-cotton composites, but with a lower cotton content and price than fustians, were principally produced for Atlantic markets, but were also used within Britain for women\u2019s aprons, while smallwares encompassed a range of worsted, linen, cotton and silk tapes, laces and threads sold to an equally diverse body of domestic and international consumers.[CITATION-19] Two groups of manufacturers controlled the production of Manchester goods: resident Manchester firms and \u2018country manufacturers\u2019, the latter based in the smaller hinterland settlements and listed separately in the directories as using the Manchester market to sell their output. In the 1770s, town manufacturers were already more numerous than their country equivalents, comprising around two-thirds of the textile producers associated with the Manchester market (seeand[CITATION-2] ). Even so, physical production in Manchester was largely confined to smallwares, as well as the finishing processes, and the Manchester manufacturers\u2019 production of fustians and checks required the employment of waged cottage workers in the town\u2019s semi-rural surroundings. Country manufacturers, based directly within the weaving districts, also manufactured by \u2018putting-out\u2019, with fustians establishing strong foundations in Leigh, Bolton, Bury, Radcliffe, Prestwich, Middleton, Oldham and Ashton, while checks took root in a narrower circle of villages outside of the township, but within the parish, of Manchester. Until.1770, asshows, these towns and villages within fifteen miles of Manchester provided the bulk of textiles sold in the Manchester market, when the town provided the only significant local market for Lancashire cottons, of which only the cotton-linen printing cloths manufactured around Blackburn and Preston, in imitation of Indian calicoes for women\u2019s gowns and domestic furnishings, were not fully drawn into the orbit of the Manchester market.[CITATION-20] Manchester textile manufacturers listed in trade directories, 1772\u20131800.Sources: Elizabeth Raffald,(Manchester, 1772); Elizabeth Raffald,(Manchester, 1773); Elizabeth Raffald,(Manchester, 1781); Edmond Holme,(Manchester, 1788); John Scholes,(Manchester, 1794); John Scholes,(Manchester, 1797); G.

While the number of town and country manufacturers of fustians, checks, smallwares and woollens stagnated or even declined after the late 1780s, the number of manufacturers of muslins, dimities, calicoes and, above all, \u2018cottons\u2019 sharply increased, the remarkable effect of the mechanisation of cotton spinning which promoted the manufacture of the all-cotton cloths that had long dominated India\u2019s textile output. The trading frontiers of the Manchester market expanded in step with this commodity diversification, especially by drawing in country manufacturers in regions switching from wool or silk to cotton manufacture around Burnley, Rochdale, Stalybridge and Stockport (see). But the major expansion occurred within Manchester itself, where directories indicate resident textile manufacturers increased from 318 firms in 1788 to 514 in 1800. Given the still-limited importance of Manchester as a factory centre, this was likely to have been more an outcome of Manchester\u2019s growing importance as a centre of marketing than of production.[CITATION-21] The trade directories of the late 1780s and 1790s, at first look, indicate that Blackburn and Preston manufacturers retained their commercial independence from Manchester, but this is partly illusory: most of the leading north Lancashire cotton firms (including Peel, Yates & Co.; Livesey, Hargreaves & Co.; Howarths & Smith; Watson, Myers & Co.) had establishedbranches in Manchester and hence are listed as \u2018Manchester\u2019 rather than \u2018country\u2019 manufacturers in the directories.By the closing decades of the century Manchester thus provided a marketplace for a deeper pool of textiles produced in a more extensive hinterland. However, the workings of the Manchester market remain little understood. Did the Manchester market operate like other textile markets in eighteenth-century England? How were goods sold in Manchester and to whom? Was the maturation of the Manchester market associated with the emergence of a specialist merchant elite, elevated above the manufacturers?The best-known textile markets in eighteenth-century England were in London and the West Riding of Yorkshire. The London market was largest and most eclectic, its ascendancy rooted in the size and diversity of its population, its dominance of overseas trade, and its reputation as an arbiter of fashion. While all varieties of British and foreign textiles were sold in eighteenth-century London, the capital was the prime outlet for textiles produced in English regions which lacked significant local markets\u2014West Country woollens, East Anglia worsteds, Midlands silk and hosiery\u2014as well as the grand emporium for England\u2019s imports of Asian and European cottons, silks and linens. As the scale and scope of the London market increased in the eighteenth century, its commercial organisation became more complex. At the century\u2019s outset, provincial textile manufacturers selling in London had generally consigned their output to City \u2018factors\u2019, who sold them on commission to the two main groups of London textile purchasers\u2014merchants in the export trade and metropolitan and provincial retailers in the domestic trade\u2014usually offering credit to both manufacturer and buyer. However, by the mid-century, the lengthening credits expected in domestic and foreign markets stretched the financial resources of the London factors, who increasingly found it expedient to sell to an intermediate group of wholesalers\u2014variously identified as warehousemen, drapers and mercers\u2014who in turn supplied merchants and retailers on credit. Once established as the key intermediaries in the trade, such wholesale warehousemen could circumvent the factors entirely and order cloths directly from the provincial manufacturers. Some of the greatest fortunes in eighteenth-century London business were made by these warehousemen: the capital of the Fludyers in woollens and the Barclays in linens, for example, greatly surpassed those of most merchants and, indeed, by.1750, London warehouseman had begun to encroach on the activities of merchants and had developed their own significant overseas trade interests.[CITATION-22] A final, important development in the London textile market was for provincial manufacturers to establish their own City warehouses. This practice was evident in.1750 but became firmly established in the closing decades of the eighteenth century, when the largest provincial manufacturers kept permanent warehouses in London, while smaller producers occupied salerooms in City inns. John Chartres demonstrated the importance of London coaching inns as marketing spaces, emphasising their proliferation at the end of the arterial routes flowing into the City. The most common was the courtyard inn, set back from a main thoroughfare, with ancillary, sub-tenanted buildings\u2014stables, shops, warehouses\u2014clustered around a central enclosure.[CITATION-23] Stanley Chapman has shown that most of Nottingham\u2019s hosiers sold directly in London in the early 1770s\u2014from their own warehouses or from the inns around Wood Street\u2014while Ursula Priestley demonstrates that Norwich worsted manufacturers effected their London sales from rooms rented from innkeepers around Bishopsgate, the terminus of the road carriers\u2019 routes to the eastern counties.[CITATION-24] The West Riding woollen industry, with its emphasis on a narrow range of commodities and local rather than metropolitan sales, offers an alternative model of an eighteenth-century textile market. Indeed, the localisation of sales was such that five principal markets operated within the region, each specialising in the wool textiles produced in their immediate hinterlands. In Yorkshire, woollen and worsted manufacturers had limited connections with London but instead sold their output from rented stalls in purpose-built local cloth halls. By the 1770s, Leeds\u2019s two main cloth halls provided accommodation for more than 3,000 manufacturers; the Wakefield, Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield halls collectively accommodated roughly half as many again. The main buyers at the halls were local merchants, who oversaw the finishing processes and sold directly to national and international markets.[CITATION-25] Did the Manchester market conform to either the London or the West Riding model? The handful of contemporary descriptions of the Manchester textile market emphasise the absence of cloth halls. An Exchange, it is true, had been built in Manchester in the early eighteenth century, but if this institution had ever been used for selling textiles, it had ceased to do so by mid-century, and was mainly occupied by sellers of foodstuffs when it was demolished in 1792.[CITATION-26] In fact, the first Manchester trade directories suggest sales took place in three distinct physical spaces: the premises of textile finishers; private warehouses; and commercial inns. And, by 1800, only the last two retained significance. Thus, in 1781, while almost one-quarter of country manufacturers merely allowed buyers to view their stock in rooms provided by their Manchester \u2018callenderers\u2019\u2014a class of tradesmen who machine-pressed cloths on the manufacturers\u2019 behalf before sale\u2014this practice was followed by only 6 per cent of country manufacturers in 1788, after which the use of such premises for selling textiles fell out of use.In contrast, the use of salerooms in warehouses and commercial inns increased in importance in the later decades of the century and these came to be the principal places where country manufacturers effected their Manchester sales. The 1800 directory, for example, lists 132 country manufacturers with specific Manchester warehouse addresses, 105 who sold from inns, and another 24 firms using both.[CITATION-27] These premises\u2014warehouses and inns\u2014were clustered around Market Place, at the heart of the town\u2019s commercial district. Indeed, there may have been only minor differences between warehouses and inns as places where country manufacturers sold their goods. Both types of premises had features in common with the courtyard inns of London. In 1800, for example, 81 of 131 country manufacturers\u2019 \u2018warehouses\u2019 were in fact small rooms in multi-tenanted buildings located around a \u2018court\u2019, \u2018yard\u2019 or \u2018entry\u2019, with another thirteen in alleys, and three in lanes. In contrast, resident Manchester manufacturers\u2019 warehouses were much larger, self-contained buildings: in 1800, just 84 out of 514 (16 per cent) were in courts or yards, the remainder located on main streets and squares across the town\u2019s central districts. In 1788, for example, a Manchester warehouse advertised in a local newspaper was described as \u2018suitable for a Manufacturer\u2019 or one that could be \u2018divided to suit Country Tradesmen\u2019.[CITATION-28] Resident Manchester manufacturers occupied larger warehouses than country manufacturers because they had functions beyond simply exposing goods for sale. Indeed, in the mid-eighteenth century, Manchester manufacturers often lived in their warehouses. Percival\u2019s critique of the social aspirations ofManchester manufacturers mocked their dwelling rooms with \u2018ware-houses under, and warping rooms over\u2019. Over the next few decades, this practice became less prevalent: just 13 per cent of Manchester warehouses contained living quarters in 1801.[CITATION-29] Still, even without dwelling space, Manchester warehouses served a number of purposes: they contained the \u2018counting house\u2019, where principals or clerks wrote letters and kept the ledgers; they were used as a central hub to \u2018put out\u2019 cotton and yarn, and to \u2018take in\u2019 piece goods before and after finishing; and they were used to store, display and sell goods.[CITATION-30] Although the trade directories permit a detailed reconstruction of who sold textiles in late eighteenth-century Manchester, and the physical spaces where sales were made, they are much less useful as a means to identify the buyers of textiles in the Manchester market. In fact, the directories contain numerous plausible occupational categories for textile purchasers. Some, such as warehousemen, drapers and mercers, suggest parallels with the London market, while others, such as merchants, invite comparisons with Yorkshire. The Manchester township rate books, which survive intermittently for the late eighteenth century, provide some remedy for the directories\u2019 shortcomings. Unlike the directories, rate books classify the function of each property in the town (warehouse, shop, factory, house etc.) and assign each a rateable value (RV). The former helps, in some cases, to clarify the business roles of the directory listees, while the latter, conventionally used as a proxy for property value, gives a suggestion of business scale.[CITATION-31] The remainder of this section analyses the directory and rate-book evidence, as well as the more informative but scarcer material available in manufacturers\u2019 sales records, to demonstrate that the use of directories in isolation has created a misleading impression of the Manchester textile market, one that overstates the roles played by warehousemen and drapers, and obscures the fact that the major resident purchasers came from within the upper echelons of the manufacturing community itself.\u2018Warehouseman\u2019 is the most prevalent directory classification that implies a significant role in buying textiles in Manchester. There were already fifty-eight warehousemen listed in the 1772 directory, increasing to more than 200 by 1800. Such evidence has induced some historians to consider that Manchester warehousemen performed similar roles to the wealthy firms that controlled much of London\u2019s textile trade in the eighteenth century.[CITATION-32] However, a quite different picture emerges when the directory evidence is considered alongside information in the Manchester rate books. The 1797 directory, for example, lists as many as 166 \u2018warehousemen\u2019, 117 of whom appear in the rate book for the same year. However, these 117 properties had an average RV of just \u00a35, the lowest average rating of any category connected to the textile trades in Manchester.[CITATION-33] These 117 properties, furthermore, were rated as \u2018houses\u2019 rather than business premises and, as such, were most probably the residences of warehouse managers or employees rather than the premises of independent wholesaling firms. Some of the warehousemen properties, it is true, were of a more substantial nature, but only nine firms listed in the 1797 directory had unambiguous wholesaling designations and, unlike the other 117, occupied premises with comparable ratings, by type and value, with those of other Manchester businesses.[CITATION-34] Although less numerous than \u2018warehousemen\u2019, the array of drapers and mercers listed in the directories\u2014around one in five of whom were women in the mid-1790s\u2014were probably more significant as textile purchasers in the Manchester market. While traditionally associated with buying and selling woollens, linens and silks, the London evidence tells us that such firms also embraced the trades in Asian and British cottons in the eighteenth century.[CITATION-35] However, the rate books indicate that, unlike the great London wholesalers whose businesses often had similar designations, most Manchester drapers and mercers confined their business to the retail trade. Their premises were invariably rated as \u2018shops\u2019 in the late eighteenth century, and given that the market for cottons amongst the local clientele served by such shopkeepers was small relative to the national market\u2014the town, even in its broadest definition, contained less than 1 per cent of the English population,.1750\u20131800\u2014it is doubtful that these fifty or sixty drapers/mercers were more than secondary buyers of cottons in the Manchester market.[CITATION-36] The most plausible remaining directory identifiers for local textile buyers are \u2018merchants\u2019 and \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019. However, the directories suggest that three-quarters of Manchester merchants in the textile industry primarily traded in raw cotton or yarn, or a combination of the two, rather than finished textiles. Firms described as \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019 can be more readily linked to the cloth branch and were more numerous than firms described only as \u2018merchants\u2019 by the 1790s (see). The RV evidence also suggests a prominent role for \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019. Indeed, as shown in, their average warehouse RV in 1797 was \u00a342, by far the highest of any category examined, suggesting that \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019 formed the elite of Manchester\u2019s business community, a vastly different picture to the social \u2018ideal\u2019 described by eighteenth-century commentators. However, the limited occupational and property information contained in both directories and rate books preclude definite conclusions about such firms\u2019practices in the Manchester market: after all, the \u2018merchant\u2019 aspect of their designation might simply reflect sales of their own production to national and international markets.Manchester trade directory marketing classifications, 1772\u20131800.Sources: asNotes: Wholesale section: \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019 includes firms classified as merchants, manufacturers and printers, and manufacturers and chapmen; \u2018cotton merchants\u2019 includes cotton dealers, cotton warehouse; \u2018cotton and yarn merchants\u2019 includes dealers in cotton, weft and twist; \u2018yarn merchants\u2019 includes dealers in weft and twist, cotton twist/weft warehouse; \u2018Dealer in textiles\u2019 includes dealers in worsteds, woollens, blankets, silks, smallwares, linens, fustians, checks, printed cottons, cottons; \u2018warehouseman (specific)\u2019 includes muslin warehouse, fustian warehouse, dimity, calico and print warehouse, fustian, dimity and calico warehouse, upholstery warehouse, dimity warehouse, counterpane warehouse, linen, cloth, print and handkerchief warehouse; \u2018Textile wholesaler\u2019 includes wholesale linen draper and wholesaler hosier; \u2018Other\u2019 includes firms engaged in two wholesale actives that were infrequently paired; \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019, \u2018manufacturers and Irish linen merchants\u2019, \u2018manufacturers and yarn merchants\u2019 also appear inas manufacturers.

Unfortunately, just three Manchester or country manufacturers are known to have left records sufficiently comprehensive to analyse the full scope of their sales in the final three decades of the century. The most striking aspect of these sales records is the extent of Manchester manufacturers\u2019 purchases of cottons in the market. Hence, as the sales records listed inshow, the leading local buyers of cottons in the 1770s and 1780s were not described in directories as merchants, warehousemen or drapers, but asof various types of Manchester goods. By the late 1790s, as Gray\u2019s sales illustrate, the leading purchasers may have been found among the increasingly prevalent directory designation of \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019. Of course, the sales of three manufacturers cannot be taken as representative of total market activity in the later eighteenth century. Nonetheless, this article will go on to demonstrate that the same \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019 were also the leading Manchester exporters to international markets by the 1790s. First, however, it is necessary to consider the interactions between the London and Manchester markets for cottons, and the rise of Manchester as an export centre.Function of Manchester textile purchasers: evidence from manufacturers\u2019 sales records.Sources: Col. 1: MALS, GB127.MS ff 657 D43, Day book of unknown Manchester firm, 1773\u20139; Col. 2: John Rylands Library, Manchester, Samuel Oldknow Papers, SO 11/1, day book, 1782\u20134; 11/2, day book, 1786\u20137, 11/3, day book, 1788, 11/4, day book, 1789\u201390; Col. 3: Bolton Archives, ZGE/3, William Gray, Daybook, 1796\u20131802.Notes: Sales of finished textiles, woven accessories and clothing only (sales of rovings/yarns excluded), all of which were rounded to the nearest pound sterling; firms classified as described in the Manchester trade directory nearest the point of sale; \u2018manufacturers\u2019 includes firms described as manufacturers and printers; \u2018merchants/dealers\u2019 includes cotton merchants, yarn merchants, and firms described as dealers in various types of textiles; \u2018warehousemen\u2019 includes firms described as \u2018wholesale\u2019 linen drapers; Manchester is defined as inand includes firms operating in both Manchester and London, which are classified as they appear in the Manchester trade directories.The unknown firm\u2019s daybook begins in 1773, but many entries before 1775 are obscured by invoices later pasted over the pages.

Aikin saw two major changes taking place after.1730. First, Manchester manufacturers began to sell directly to provincial shopkeepers who previously \u2018had been supplied by the wholesale dealer\u2019 and, secondly, from.1770, Manchester became directly involved in overseas trade.[CITATION-38] Subsequent research has endorsed the essentials of Aikin\u2019s account. There is now abundant evidence that Manchester manufacturers had developed extensive distribution networks across Britain by the 1730s, using travelling salesmen to solicit orders from an increasingly sophisticated body of town and country shopkeepers. What is less clear is the extent to which direct sales from Manchester posed a significant challenge to London\u2019s traditional function as a wholesale distributor of Manchester goods. Most historians have tentatively concluded that the sales conducted via London factors and warehousemen surpassed those flowing through Manchester, although Chapman has argued that Manchester \u2018set the pace\u2019 in the home trade after 1760.[CITATION-39] The sales records of the three Lancashire cotton manufacturers discussed above provide one way to assess the London and Manchester markets for cottons in the later eighteenth century, as well as the scale of manufacturers\u2019 direct trade with provincial retailers and outport merchants. The data, presented in, invite three main conclusions. First, while the three firms sold most of their output in London and Manchester, London sales predominated, accounting for between 35 and 79 per cent of each firm\u2019s total sales. Secondly, the London trade was highly concentrated: the three manufacturers had far more buyers in Manchester than in London, but average London sales were much larger. Finally, direct sales to both provincial drapers and outport merchants comprised a relatively minor part (11\u201327 per cent) of the three firms\u2019 total sales. Of course, such evidence can provide no more than a glimpse of the channels used to distribute cottons within England. However, M.M. Edwards and Beverly Lemire have marshalled a range of descriptive evidence to demonstrate cotton manufacturers\u2019 reliance on the contacts, information and finance provided by London warehouseman and factors in the late eighteenth century, a finding reaffirmed in the surviving correspondences of two North-West manufacturers in the early years of the nineteenth century, at a time when London trade directories suggest that few Lancashire manufacturers had established their own City warehouses.[CITATION-40] English sales of North-West cottons: evidence from manufacturers\u2019 sales records.Sources: as.Notes: Firms are assigned a geographical category based on descriptions given in the original ledgers or by cross-referencing with trade directories.

Did Manchester forge a more important role in the export trade? Certainly, given the small size of English cotton-textile exports in the first half of the century, Manchester\u2019s initial involvement in exporting must have been limited. As late as.1750, just two regions\u2014the West Indies and Africa\u2014took 88 per cent of England\u2019s exports of cottons, a trade worth only \u00a320,000 per year, at a time when Englishexports had reached \u00a33.9m.[CITATION-41] The West Indian trade, in any case, was largely centred on London, the major destination for the vast quantities of slave-grown sugar poured onto the home market. The West Indian business was dominated by a core of wealthy London commission merchants, who controlled shipping between England and the islands, and performed a range of commodity and financial transactions on behalf of West Indian planters.[CITATION-42] In 1768\u201372, indeed, fully 90 per cent of English exports to the West Indies were still despatched from London.[CITATION-43] The eighteenth-century slave trade was also controlled by port-based rather than inland merchants, especially, from the 1740s, by those of Liverpool. The logistical and entrepreneurial challenges of the triangular trade channelled the trade into the hands of specialist merchant firms and, although Manchester checks and handkerchiefs became increasingly prevalent in slave barters from the mid-century, most inland cotton manufacturers sold their output outright to Liverpool, Bristol and London slavers rather than actively participating in the trade.[CITATION-44] Manchester\u2019s direct involvement in these West Indian and African trades depended on extended kinship networks in London, the outports and the colonies. Robert Hibbert & Co. of Manchester exported directly to Jamaica as early as the 1720s, but his firm had unusually strong metropolitan and island connections: Thomas Hibbert was the leading slave factor on Jamaica; Hibbert, Purrier & Horton was one of the largest London commission agencies in the sugar trade.[CITATION-45] Likewise, Thomas & Peter Touchet, Manchester check manufacturers, who exported to the West Indies from 1714, had family connections in London and Liverpool, who provided access to twenty ships in the West India trade in the mid-eighteenth century: Samuel Touchet, of London, was an MP, government contractor, insurance broker, cotton importer and slave trader.[CITATION-46] Few Manchester firms could boast these kinds of connections and, although the manufacturers who specialised in the production of cottons for the African and West Indian markets occasionally consigned cottons on speculation to the islands or took shares in individual slave-trading voyages, neither practice mounted a serious challenge to the trades managed directly from the ports.[CITATION-47] Manchester in fact established its prominence as an export centre in the second half of the eighteenth century in markets not previously significant for the cotton industry: the continent of Europe and the North American colonies. England\u2019s Continental trade became increasingly dispersed in the eighteenth century as many northern, central and southern European nations established mercantile and financial institutions that partially freed them from commercial dependence on the major maritime powers of north-west Europe. First, from the early eighteenth century, England\u2019s \u2018staplemarket\u2019 trade, conducted via the major trading emporia of Holland and Germany, was increasingly supplanted by direct trade on the accounts of a diversity of merchants operatingthe vast region previously controlled from German and Dutch seaports, one comprising the leading trading towns of central Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Poland and Bohemia.[CITATION-48] Secondly, from the 1760s, a growing part of England\u2019s export trade to southern Europe bypassed the English \u2018factories\u2019 in Lisbon, Porto, Cadiz and Leghorn, where English factors acting on behalf of principals in London and the outports (and in competition with their Dutch and French equivalents) had previously controlled these ports\u2019 overseas trades to northern Europe. By the late eighteenth century, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian merchants, in ports and inland towns, had achieved sufficient commercial independence to order goods on their own accounts from England.[CITATION-49] New channels of trade competed with old but did not eliminate them: Amsterdam and Hamburg remained major export markets for English industry; English merchants and factors resident in foreign entrep\u00f4ts retained importance into the nineteenth century, not least in the trade with Russia, the only major export market for English cottons to the east of the Danish Sound.[CITATION-50] But the fragmentation of European trade offered new opportunities for exporters willing to trade beyond the established entrep\u00f4ts. The first success of English cottons in the European trade, for example, stemmed from the development of velverets, an all-cotton fustian pushed by Manchester rather than London exporters after the Seven Years War. By 1775, London exported just 17 per cent of English fustians and velverets destined for European markets but 83 per cent of the much smaller exports of English printed calicoes to the same region.[CITATION-51] This was a very rapidly growing non-metropolitan trade. Jackson has shown that fustians exported through Hull, Manchester\u2019s main gateway to the Continent, increased from just 20 pieces in 1758 to 257,000 in 1783. Crucially, Manchester firms did not sell cottons to Hull merchants but corresponded directly with Continental importers: Hull merchants merely handled \u2018the physical side of the shipment\u2019.[CITATION-52] The critical aspect of Manchester\u2019s European trade was the employment of \u2018out riders\u2019 on the Continent, who undertook lengthy commercial tours to make new connections, solicit business and demonstrate their product range using pattern books containing numbered swatches of cloth.[CITATION-53] Manchester men also became more visible in the English factory at St Petersburg but, as Anglo-Russian trade was mainly focused on English imports, the factory was still, in.1800, dominated by English merchants (by birth or naturalisation) connected to London and the outports. The only two Manchester firms with St Petersburg agencies on which we have information\u2014Morewood & Longsdon and Grant, Wakefield & Krehmer\u2014were either short-lived or ended in bankruptcy.[CITATION-54] The second half of the eighteenth century witnessed the \u2018Americanisation\u2019 of English overseas trade. While the major expansion of Anglo-American exports in the two decades after 1750 did not immediately overturn London\u2019s long-held commercial supremacy in colonial trade, firms in inland manufacturing towns\u2014Leeds, Manchester, Halifax, Sheffield and Birmingham\u2014began to capture a growing share of orders for English manufactures in the non-plantation colonies to the north of the future Mason\u2013Dixon line. As in the European trades, Manchester established its American trade through the extensive use of commercial travellers, but the initiative ran in both directions: American merchants made their own tours of England to consolidate relationships with extant suppliers and to build new contacts in the manufacturing regions. Such connections flourished after the American Revolution, when Manchester decisively supplanted London in the rising exports of cottons to Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore and Boston.[CITATION-55] However, Manchester exporters were much less prominent in the trades with the southern plantations, where the London, Bristol and Liverpool merchants who traded in American comestibles and raw materials continued to control reciprocal exports of English cottons and other manufactures until the early nineteenth century.[CITATION-56] What accounts for these discrepancies in the extent of Manchester\u2019s direct participation in England\u2019s overseas trade? Empire does not seem to have been important: Manchester was more active in the trade to continental Europe than to the British plantations. Nor was distance decisive, as indicated by Manchester\u2019s export success in the markets of the north-eastern United States. In fact, it was the structure of particular markets that was most significant. Thus, in trades that demanded significant investments in importing or shipping\u2014the slave-plantation trades or the Baltic trades\u2014inland firms such as those in Manchester made little headway, except where they were prepared to establish operational infrastructure to match those of the port merchants. In contrast, where there was an established class of foreign or colonial merchants able to order cottons on their own account and pay for them in bills of exchange rather than bulky commodities, Manchester firms specialising in local cloth could furnish such exports on better terms than port merchants, for whom textiles were just one part of more diverse commercial operations. The fastest growing export trades in cottons, to continental Europe and the USA, were those where Manchester merchants were most active, while the domestic and slave-plantation markets, where their influence was the least apparent, declined in relative significance as the century wore on.[CITATION-57] Thus, in.1750, at least 90 per cent of English-made cottons were sold at home, in Africa, or in the West Indies, but these markets took barely 50 per cent by.1800.[CITATION-58] The identification of the Manchester firms who developed these major trades in Manchester goods to Europe and America is not straightforward. It is not possible, for example, to use port data to calculate individual merchants\u2019 participation in particular trades.[CITATION-59] Neither do the kind of institutional sources used, for example, in Robert Bennett\u2019s recent work on the membership of the Manchester Committee of Trade between 1774 and 1786, provide a direct means of identifying export merchants. This was a policy group designed to protect local economic interests from government interference, whose activities did not prioritise the cotton industry or overseas trade. The Committee\u2019s subscribers, as Bennett makes clear, cannot be taken as a list of Manchester merchants.[CITATION-60] In fact, the number of Manchester exporters in the second half of the century remains largely unknown. Farnie, using directories, enumerates only four Manchester \u2018merchant-shippers\u2019 in 1786, a substantial underestimation that reflects the limitations of conventional sources to identify the town\u2019s merchants in the late eighteenth century.[CITATION-61] Other sources are needed to establish the dimensions of the Manchester merchant community and thus to contextualise the classifications used in trade directories. The most reliable information is contained in the surviving business papers of foreign importers, which provide direct evidence on English exporters and allow assessments of the relative importance of different trading centres and the leading firms within them. However, while such records are relatively rich for North American merchants, those of European merchants are less extensive or remain unexploited for this purpose.[CITATION-62] Indeed, information on Manchester\u2019s European trade only becomes abundant in the 1790s, especially in the form of the signatories of local memorials relating to particular international trades, and in the surviving records of the Commercial Society of Merchants Trading on the Continent of Europe (CSMTCE), established in 1794. While these latter sources permit Manchester exporters to be linked with specific European markets, they do not help to distinguish between major and minor exporters and it is possible that memorials were signed by firms/individuals with an interest in particular regions but who did not actually export directly to them. As such, the sources might under-represent Manchester exporters between the 1760s and 1780s and overstate them in the 1790s. Moreover, the sources do not cover Manchester\u2019s exports to three important markets for cottons: Ireland, the West Indies and western Africa, although the voluminous information on slave-trade investors contained in thedatabase amply substantiates the point that Manchester firms played a minimal direct role in the latter trade.[CITATION-63] and[CITATION-9] and the Appendix describe the 129 distinct Manchester export firms identified from the sources outlined above across three sub-periods. All of the named partners in these Manchester export firms were men, a finding in line with other cohorts of eighteenth-century overseas traders examined by historians, although women\u2019s formal business participation was more prevalent in Manchester\u2019s retail and clothing sectors; the sources reveal nothing about the informal participation of women within export firms.[CITATION-64] The raw data suggest a slowly growing export community before.1780, with just sixteen Manchester firms identified as exporters in the 1760s and 1770s, but one which grew rapidly thereafter, with forty-two apparent new entrants in the 1780s and seventy-one in the 1790s, although many newcomers in the European branch probably entered the trade earlier than the sources suggest. The evidence indicates significant specialisation by trading region. In the 1760s and 1770s, just 6 per cent of identified exporters are known to have traded withEurope and North America, increasing to only 15 per cent in the 1780s and 1790s. As might be expected, Manchester\u2019s pioneer exporters focused on the traditional branches of Manchester goods: as late as 1788, indeed, 70 per cent of known Manchester exporters traded in fustians, checks or smallwares. Cross-referencing with the trade directories suggests that two important changes had taken place by the 1790s. First, exporters of \u2018cotton\u2019 textiles became more prominent, encompassing over half the exporters to Europe, although only one quarter of those to America. Secondly, \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019 replaced \u2018manufacturers\u2019 as the most prevalent exporter category.Directory classifications of Manchester exporters and the regions traded with, 1760s\u20131790s.Source: see Appendix.Notes: \u2018Merchants and manufacturers\u2019 includes fustian/cotton manufacturer and importer of Irish linen; fustian manufacturer and wine merchant; merchant, manufacturer and printer. \u2018Calico printers\u2019 includes cotton printer and manufacturer; cotton manufacturer dyer and printer; calico manufacturer and printer.Directory classifications of Manchester exporters and the regions traded with, 1760s\u20131790s.Source: see Appendix.Notes: \u2018Merchants and manufacturers\u2019 includes fustian/cotton manufacturer and importer of Irish linen; fustian manufacturer and wine merchant; merchant, manufacturer and printer. \u2018Calico printers\u2019 includes cotton printer and manufacturer; cotton manufacturer dyer and printer; calico manufacturer and printer.Manchester export firms, 1760s\u20131790s: types of textiles exported.Sources: as.Notes: \u2018Silk-cotton\u2019 includes silk manufacturer and handkerchief manufacturer; \u2018Cotton\u2019 includes cotton spinner; \u2018Calico\u2019 includes merchant, manufacturer and printer; and cotton manufacturer dyer and printer. \u2018Combinations\u2019 consists of firms who manufactured/exported goods in more than one of the branches listed in cols. 1\u20137; \u2018Other/non-specified\u2019 includes hat manufacturer; dimity and muslinet manufacturer; nankeen and fustian manufacturer; merchant and manufacturer; merchant; and firms not listed in trade directories.Manchester export firms, 1760s\u20131790s: types of textiles exported.Sources: as.Notes: \u2018Silk-cotton\u2019 includes silk manufacturer and handkerchief manufacturer; \u2018Cotton\u2019 includes cotton spinner; \u2018Calico\u2019 includes merchant, manufacturer and printer; and cotton manufacturer dyer and printer. \u2018Combinations\u2019 consists of firms who manufactured/exported goods in more than one of the branches listed in cols. 1\u20137; \u2018Other/non-specified\u2019 includes hat manufacturer; dimity and muslinet manufacturer; nankeen and fustian manufacturer; merchant and manufacturer; merchant; and firms not listed in trade directories.Except for a handful of contemporary, or near-contemporary, descriptive sources, few records survive on the pioneers of Manchester\u2019s European trade. P.A. Nemnich, a German visitor to Manchester in 1799, offered a brief report on Manchester\u2019s Continental trade, identifying three pathbreaking firms in the 1760s and 1770s: Douglas & Co.; Harrison & Houghton; and Edmund Radcliffe, the named partners of which all came from families with long-standing connections to textile production in Manchester and its hinterland.[CITATION-65] Nemnich placed most emphasis on the latter: \u2018his trade was the largest and he worked extensively to establish links with all ports of the world\u2019.[CITATION-66] In the mid-1770s, the Philadelphian merchant Jabez Fisher had recorded an equally laudatory account of Radcliffe\u2019s business in his private journal. Radcliffe, he said, was \u2018the greatest manufacturer in England\u2019 with a \u2018prodigious\u2019 trade with France, the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean.[CITATION-67] The more substantive information available for the last two decades of the century shows a widening pool of Manchester firms in European trade but one in which only one of the pioneer firms (Harrison & Houghton) remained active. A partner of the firm Collen Fr\u00e8res, Carmichael & Co. of Le Havre visited Manchester in the aftermath of the Eden Treaty to build new connections in England. The surviving diary of his trip\u2014signed only by \u2018A.L.\u2019\u2014describes the activities of twenty-three Manchester firms already active in the European trade. The 1788 directory has information on twenty-two of these firms: thirteen manufactured fustians, four calicoes, two checks and three manufactured in more than one branch. Despite their direct participation in international trade, only four of these firms were described as \u2018merchants\u2019 in addition to their manufacturing interests[CITATION-68] The diplomatic uncertainties of the 1790s prompted a flurry of Manchester petitions seeking government protection of its burgeoning European interests and led to the formation of CSMTCE, significantly increasing the information available on Manchester\u2019s exporters. While these sources reveal as many as eighty-nine Manchester firms active in the European trade by that decade (see), they do not help to discriminate between regular and more occasional exporters. There was a particularly visible core of signatories on the trading memorials\u2014seventeen firms signed four or more, fifteen \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019 and two \u2018merchants\u2019\u2014but this might reflect the extent of these firms\u2019 political engagement as much as their trade. The RV of exporters\u2019 Manchester warehouses offers another indirect measure of business scale. In fact, of the seventeen most active petitioners, only eight\u2014C.F. Brandt; Entwistles & Sturtevant; J. & J. Potter; Potter & Crompton; Houghton; Barrow & Marriott; the Rawlinsons; and N. & F. Philips\u2014paid tax on the more substantial warehouse properties rated above \u00a350 in 1797. The named partners of some these firms, as well as others listed in the trade directories, suggest that Manchester\u2019s merchant community was becoming more cosmopolitan in the closing years of the eighteenth century, when merchants from long-established North-West manufacturing dynasties were joined by more recent arrivals from the continent of Europe, although the use of surnames as identifiers for \u2018foreign\u2019 merchants has proved problematic, not least in failing to take naturalisation into account.[CITATION-69] John Scholes, in an unpublished study completed in 1870, used the directories, and his own connections within the nineteenth-century Manchester merchant community, to enumerate European merchants based in Manchester from 1781. His data indicate the presence of five \u2018foreign\u2019 merchants in Manchester in the 1780s but as many as twenty-one in the 1790s, although he only recorded fourteen firms still in operation in 1800.[CITATION-70] Combining Scholes\u2019 data with the material collated in the Appendix permits some general inferences on the commercial significance of Europeans in Manchester in the later part of the eighteenth century. First, the raw data suggest that firms with at least one named \u2018foreign\u2019 partner accounted for around one-sixth of Manchester exporters to Europe in each of the last two decades of the century. Secondly, although apparent Dutch, French and Italian merchants were established in Manchester before 1800, German firms were most prominent, a distinction that would hold true until the 1860s.[CITATION-71] Thirdly, foreign merchants operated businesses similar in scope to their British-born equivalents. They did not, for example, solely trade with their country of origin: Alberti, in 1791, advertised for a clerk fluent in French as well as his native Italian; Krauss and Bickerdike traded to Spain as well as their home countries.[CITATION-72] Neither were these Manchester firms simply buying agencies for European importers: Bickerdike, Sturtevant, Alberti, Brandt, the Bernhards, Rupp, Frasche and Uhde, for example, were all originally described as \u2018manufacturers\u2019 or \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019 in the directories. In fact, four of the \u2018foreign\u2019 merchants (Sturtevant, Alberti, Frasche, Rupp) originally formed partnerships with British-born merchants and at least two (Uhde and Justamond) began as out-riders or clerks for Manchester exporters.[CITATION-73] From the mid-1790s, however, new arrivals began to concentrate on market purchases only, and did not manufacture, a distinct break from established Manchester practice, and one that became characteristic of the \u2018foreign houses\u2019 that dominated much of the European trade in Manchester cottons in the nineteenth century.[CITATION-74] The quantity and richness of the surviving mercantile records for American merchants trading with England permits a more confident identification of the major exporters in Manchester\u2019s North Atlantic trade. Although several Manchester houses were active by the 1750s, it was Hyde & Hamilton who most strongly promoted the export trade in Manchester goods to the mainland colonies in the generation before the Revolution, benefiting no doubt from the two families\u2019 long association with the manufacture of Manchester goods, as well as the Hyde family\u2019s mercantile connections in Belfast and New York.[CITATION-75] The partners went their separate ways in the 1760s, each establishing major export businesses in fustians, checks and smallwares in the late colonial period. Indeed, most of the pioneer Manchester exporters to North America took orders for the full scope of goods sold in the Manchester market\u2014Benjamin Bowers, for example, exported hats in addition to fustians, checks and smallwares\u2014while American merchants visiting Manchester in the late colonial period found the more specialist fustian manufacturers in the European trade unable to supply their commodity requirements.[CITATION-76] Despite the breaking of the political bond between Britain and its former colonies in North America, exports of Manchester goods to the USA grew strongly after 1783, attracting new entrants to the trade and promoting the commodity specialisation of leading exporters. The Philips family, which had ancestral roots in Staffordshire but had been established in Manchester since the early eighteenth century, occupied a prominent position: Thomas, in hats and smallwares; Nathaniel & Falkner, in fustians and smallwares; John, in handkerchiefs, checks, muslins and calicoes; and Samuel, in fustians.[CITATION-77] Likewise, the two successors of the Hydes, Samuel Greg & Co. and Charles Wood & Co., divided the business to concentrate on fustians and checks respectively, while Ackers & Wilson, Johnson, and Hanson specialised in exports of silk-cotton handkerchiefs. Firms controlling spinning mills and printworks in northeast Lancashire, and very extensive Manchester warehouses, dominated exports of the \u2018newer\u2019 calicoes and muslins. The Peels were strongly connected in both branches. Peel, Yates & Co. and Peel, Yates, Tipping & Halliwell featured most prominently among several exporters of printed cottons, while Peels, Ainsworth & Co. are the only Manchester firm known to specialise in exporting muslins to the US. Indeed, Manchester\u2019s exporters to America comprised a much smaller group than those in the European trade, as distinctively heavy credit demands placed barriers to entry on smaller firms.[CITATION-78] A Manchester memorial on the American trade in 1794, for example, was signed by just fourteen firms. The signatories match closely with the names identified in American importers\u2019 ledgers: the exception, a dry salter, probably imported American raw materials rather than exported cottons; the remaining firms comprised eight \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019 and five manufacturers.[CITATION-79] There is, however, little evidence of American merchants settling in Manchester before 1800. Timothy Wiggin of Boston had set up as a merchant in the town by 1799 but it was not until the early part of the nineteenth century that a distinct American merchant community in Manchester became firmly established.[CITATION-80] As demonstrated above, Manchester\u2019s other major Atlantic trades\u2014with Africa and the West Indies\u2014were mainly exploited by merchants in London, Liverpool and Bristol in the second half of the eighteenth century. However, a core of Manchester manufacturers, including the Taylors, Powell, Ford, Robinson & Heywood, Hanson, John Philips, Parke, and the Rawlinsons, initially focused much of their activities on making checks and handkerchiefs for slave and plantation markets, often as scions of Liverpool or Lancaster merchant families.[CITATION-81] Joseph Inikori has argued that the supply of checks to the slave trade acted as an incubator for the expansion of Manchester\u2019s European trade in the late eighteenth century: \u2018It was when the check makers found their markets in Western Africa and on the New World plantations interrupted by the American War of Independence that they turned their eyes to Europe \u2026 the evidence suggests that check manufacturers led the way in the development of cotton exports to Europe from 1775 onwards\u2019. However, the progenitors of Manchester\u2019s European trade rarely had connections with the production of checks for the slave-plantation trade. The Rawlinsons, as Inikori points out, made this transition, but this was an exception. The leading lights of the European trade came from a different circle of firms, specialising in fustians for menswear, not as \u2018a sideline to the production of checks\u2019 but as the mainstay of their business.[CITATION-82] In fact, there were stronger connections between the check branch and the growing trade to the US, where the Hibberts, the Touchets, Hanson, and John Philips established connections with both slave-plantation markets and North America. But such links were not essential, and many exporters rose to prominence in the US trade with no demonstrable connections with the African or plantation trades.In sum, although Manchester trade directories describe few firms as \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019 before the 1790s, it is evident that firms combining textile production and mercantile functions had emerged in the town at least three decades earlier, and that such firms were both the major purchasers of cottons in the Manchester market and the leading local exporters of cottons to overseas markets. Indeed, the overlap in the functions of \u2018merchant\u2019 and \u2018manufacturer\u2019 in late eighteenth-century Manchester is already well known. William Radcliffe\u2019s remarks which preface this article are widely cited to substantiate the point.[CITATION-83] However, it is the relationship between production and marketing in Manchester that has remained poorly understood, in part because of the elasticity of both contemporaries\u2019 and historians\u2019 uses of identifiers such as \u2018merchant\u2019 and \u2018manufacturer\u2019. Historians, for example, have used the composite term \u2018merchant-manufacturer\u2019 to describe two significantly different business models: (i) firms engaged in manufacture by putting-out rather than factory production; (ii) manufacturers who marketed their output beyond local markets. The first use emphasises methods of production rather than marketing: \u2018merchant\u2019 merely reflects that the manufacturer purchased raw materials and distributed them to outworkers to spin and weave rather than using machinery and centralised plant. The second use focuses on the marketing function with the specifics of production unimportant.The first definition of \u2018merchant-manufacturer\u2019 is unhelpfully broad and would, in fact, includeManchester and \u2018country\u2019 cotton manufacturers in this period, given the pervasiveness of putting-out in weaving. The second definition provides a clearer distinction between the bulk of manufacturers who sold in Manchester or London and the smaller number who exported to overseas markets. However, the emphasis placed on manufacturers simply selling their own production means that it overlooks one of the key functions undertaken by the \u2018merchants and manufacturers\u2019 of Manchester: buying in the market. A merchant\u2019s role encompasses buying as well as selling, and it is the former practice that has received insufficient attention. This is perhaps surprising given that Radcliffe\u2019s oft-cited account explicitly states the importance of \u2018scores\u2019 of Manchester\u2019s \u2018great oaks\u2019 purchasing cottons from the salerooms of \u2018little manufacturers \u2026 in the grey\u2019.[CITATION-84] It is difficult, in fact, to conceive how the Manchester market could have operated without these purchases given the absence of other significant local buyers. Advertisements for warehouse managers in local newspapers frequently requested experience of buying goods in the Manchester market. In 1795, for example, one Manchester firm sought a warehouseman for putting-out muslinets, dimities and fustians, adding that candidates would \u2018be more eligible, if accustomed to buying the same in this Market\u2019.[CITATION-85] How did these hundred or so Manchester export merchants fit into the broader structure of England\u2019s merchant community in the eighteenth century? How far did the Manchester practice of combining manufacture and exporting deviate from prevailing modes of mercantile organisation? For good reasons, London merchants have attracted the most attention. In 1700, when London was already home to at least one thousand merchants, the capital handled as much as 80 per cent of England\u2019s imports and 72 per cent of its exports.[CITATION-86] The London merchant community was much more cosmopolitan than Manchester\u2019s: even in the early decades of the eighteenth century, roughly one-third of leading London merchants had foreign surnames, while a 1763 London trade directory suggests that more than three-quarters of merchant firms had at least one partner of foreign descent.[CITATION-87] The internationalisation of London\u2019s merchant community reflected the growing proportion of London trade conducted on foreign account: many of the merchants drawn to the metropolis to buy and sell on commission were of foreign or colonial descent, or had been resident abroad for long periods, exploiting their overseas contacts to solicit consignments and attract orders, even if such connections were only a springboard to more diverse commercial and financial operations.[CITATION-88] While many eighteenth-century London merchants engaged in both importing and exporting, as well as in the provision of shipping and finance, they rarely manufactured the goods they shipped abroad.[CITATION-89] However, even in London, such \u2018general merchants\u2019 faced increasing competition from more specialised overseas traders. This had become apparent in the trade to north-western Europe as early as.1700, when many London merchants already concentrated on either exports or imports.[CITATION-90] By mid-century, London merchants trading with Europe and the American colonies also had to compete with City warehousemen, who specialised in certain varieties of manufactured exports, while in the 1780s and 1790s, London\u2019s declining textile exports to New York and Philadelphia were mainly handled by warehousemen, or by provincial manufacturers with City warehouses, at a time when many London merchants, and even warehousemen, were increasingly withdrawing from commodity trade to specialise in banking and finance.[CITATION-91] While London\u2019s overall mercantile supremacy endured the eighteenth century, outport trade grew at a rate unmatched by the capital. Outport merchants competed most successfully with London where they had a prominent geographical advantage in markets open to all ports\u2014the trades with Asia and Hudson\u2019s Bay were, of course, protected London monopolies\u2014and, especially, where trade was complex or multilateral, and hence benefited from the outports\u2019 relatively lower shipping and operational costs and their merchants\u2019 greater willingness to invest in lengthy and risky ventures. In contrast, where trade was mainly on foreign account, London\u2019s peerless commodity markets and financial resources hardened its resilience to competition from the outports. Liverpool and Bristol, for example, had fractional shares in the English commission trades in West Indian sugar and the best qualities of sweet-scented Chesapeake tobacco, but, after.1740, dominated the multilateral trades in enslaved Africans, Carolina rice and the coarser tobacco cultivated in the more peripheral growing regions of the Chesapeake.[CITATION-92] As Liverpool MP Isaac Gascoyne pointed out in 1799, \u2018The London merchants were mostly agents for the planters, and did not traffic with the islands on their own account; the merchants of Liverpool and Lancaster were on the contrary, exporters and importers of goods, at their own risk\u2019.[CITATION-93] Hence, the outports\u2019 gains at the expense of London were mainly in Atlantic trades associated with high levels of risk, heavy shipping costs and complex operations across a number of ports.Merchants based in inland manufacturing regions posed a different kind of challenge to London\u2019s overseas trade. The most successful incursions were made in manufacturing regions where the expansion of local markets had reduced reliance on metropolitan sales and had promoted the emergence of local merchants. The Yorkshire wool-textile industry was the most successful of these English industrial regions in the eighteenth century. In.1770, when Manchester\u2019s export trade was in its infancy, West Riding merchants already handled \u00a32.4m of wool-textile exports, roughly one quarter ofEnglish exports. However, by.1800, Manchester\u2019s merchant community of around one hundred firms had reached a similar size to that of Leeds, indicating the former\u2019s startling rise as an export centre. R.G. Wilson\u2019s classic study characterises the Leeds exporters as \u2018gentlemen merchants\u2019: unlike their Manchester counterparts, they shunned production and accumulated export cargoes only by purchasing goods outright from a pool of thousands of local manufacturers, most of whom made only a few pieces of cloth per week.[CITATION-94] However, more recent research has qualified the view that production and marketing remained in the hands of separate firms in the West Riding, suggesting that the apparent differences in commercial practice between Leeds and Manchester should not be taken too far. First, while non-manufacturing merchants dominated the major Leeds mercantile dynasties founded in the early part of the century, after.1750 exporters who manufactured some wool textiles and purchased and exported other varieties attained significance in the town, first in worsteds and later in woollens.[CITATION-95] Secondly, outside of Leeds (and Wakefield), Yorkshire exporters maintained close connections with manufacture throughout the century. John Smail\u2019s work on Halifax, the largest merchant community in the West Riding outside of Leeds, and S.A. Caunce\u2019s on the manufacturing villages to the west of Leeds, as well as W.B. Crump and Gertrude Ghorbal\u2019s older work on Huddersfield, show that, as in Manchester, the major overseas traders were manufacturers who exported their own production alongside other local textiles purchased from their smaller neighbours.[CITATION-96] Hence, the rise of Manchester in the export trade is best understood as part of changes in the structure of English overseas trade in the eighteenth century that undermined London\u2019s long-held commercial supremacy. By the mid-nineteenth century, just one-fifth of total British exports, and less than 15 per cent of exports of cottons, cleared the port of London.[CITATION-97] Historians have emphasised the challenges posed to London by outport merchants, whose rapidly expanding international trades initially depended on their merchants\u2019 readiness to engage in complex, risky or multilateral Atlantic trades on their own accounts. However, such trades were relatively unimportant in the long run. The high-water mark of Liverpool\u2019s Atlantic trades in the nineteenth century, for example, came when the port\u2019s merchants sold raw cotton on commission for southern planters or New York merchants, while providing basic shipping services for inland merchants and manufacturers in the export trade.[CITATION-98] London, meanwhile, yielded little of its prominence as a centre of domestic consumption or as an emporium for luxury imports, and consolidated and extended its position as Europe\u2019s premier financial centre, producing fortunes in business that continued to exceed those accumulated in the provincial manufacturing regions.[CITATION-99] Thus, rather than following Liverpool\u2019s lead in establishing its foreign business in risky, import-led or multilateral trades, Manchester\u2019s eighteenth-century export trade depended on its ability to export a specialist range of locally produced textiles to commercially developed consumer markets previously falling within the orbit of the London commission system. This article has uncovered the presence of more than one hundred Manchester exporters to continental Europe and North America by the end of the century. Such firms were the leading purchasers of textiles in the Manchester market, significant manufacturers in their own right, and were primarily responsible for pushing out the trading frontiers of this inland town. Although not yet fully appreciated by historians, the rise of inland export merchants appears to have been characteristic of the leading eighteenth-century provincial manufacturing regions in the English north and midlands.[CITATION-100] This development should not be viewed as a simple outcome of industrialisation, not least because significant communities of inland merchants had attained importance before the widespread adoption of mechanised technologies. Indeed, the very presence of such local merchants capable not only of directing production to respond to growing foreign demand, but who were themselves intimately involved with that production process, might help to explain why these regions were so alert to technological advances in the later part of the century. Certainly, at least one-third of the 129 Manchester export firms identified in this article are known to have invested in new cotton factories or printworks in the late eighteenth century, and this should be regarded as a minimum in the absence of more comprehensive information in mill construction in the first phase of the industrial revolution.[CITATION-101] The importance of overseas trade to England\u2019s national wealth and international standing in the eighteenth century amplified the public discourse on the social value of merchants. While both contemporaries and historians have mainly framed their discussions of merchants around the experiences of the elite merchants of London and the outports, and have emphasised that these merchants occupied a distinctive position in England\u2019s social and occupational hierarchies, such analyses have not fully captured the diversity of eighteenth-century merchants and have over-emphasised the rigidity of occupational boundaries within England\u2019s trading communities. London, of course, remained central to overseas trade, and the opportunism of outport merchants was certainly indicative of a northward shift in the centre of gravity of England\u2019s economy, but an understanding of the success of both England\u2019s international trade and its provincial manufacturing regions in the later eighteenth century requires more emphasis on the enterprise of inland merchants. The Manchester merchant community of the late eighteenth century grew in step with the maturation of the town\u2019s textile market and the growing strength of its industrial hinterland. Rather than relying on the London, Liverpool and Bristol merchants who had found limited vends for Lancashire checks in Africa and the West Indies, the \u2018great oaks\u2019 of Manchester actively cultivated new sources of demand in continental Europe and North America in the second half of the eighteenth century, giving impetus not only to their own production networks, but also to those maintained by hundreds of others in the Manchester region. The idea that eighteenth-century merchants were distinct from, or elevated above, manufacturers makes little sense in Manchester, or in other emerging industrial English towns in this period, and has obscured the importance of overseas trade, and the firms involved in it, to England\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s first industrialised nation.Known Manchester exporters of cotton textiles, 1760s and 1770sKnown Manchester exporters of cotton textiles, 1760s and 1770sKnown Manchester exporters of cotton textiles, 1780sKnown Manchester exporters of cotton textiles, 1780sKnown Manchester exporters of cotton textiles 1790sKnown Manchester exporters of cotton textiles 1790s",
