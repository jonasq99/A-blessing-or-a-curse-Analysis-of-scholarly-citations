    "article": "Orthodox historiographies on Israel\u2019s early policies in \u2018black\u2019 Africa and its relations with \u2018white\u2019 South Africa commonly, if disjointedly, assert that the state\u2019s Jewish identity had played, in the early 1960s, a key role in Israel\u2019s participation in the international \u2018struggle against apartheid\u2019. Revisiting this assertion, I examine Israel\u2019s involvement in early United Nations debates on South Africa\u2019s race policies. I trace the making of Israel\u2019s position on South Africa\u2019s treatment of persons of Indian origins in preparation for the 1950 General Assembly; present Israel\u2019s voting praxis in that session; and demonstrate the persistence of both position and praxis in the 1952 Assembly session where apartheid first appeared on the UN agenda. Against the grain of existing accounts, I argue first that, on Africa, Israel\u2019s multilateral diplomacy preceded its bilateral diplomacy; Israel\u2019s encounter with Africa began not in the early 1960s but with its 1949 UN admission, compelling its envoys to vote and reflect on African and colonial questions, including apartheid. Secondly, I demonstrate that Israel approached apartheid with equivocation; at the UN, its diplomats devised and acted on a formula allowing them, in their words, \u2018to have our cake and eat it\u2019\u2014even if, on the whole, Israel\u2019s diplomatic praxis was far more progressive than that of Western states. Thirdly, I demonstrate how Jewish identity, constructed through the prism of Israel\u2019s foundational ideology, affected such equivocation: it defined Israel\u2019s dilemma on apartheid but, at the same time, also offered a route out of that conundrum. Finally, I illustrate that the elasticity of Jewish identity displayed by Israel\u2019s envoys drew on sensibilities that were often formed in South Africa itself by their own previous encounters with racially-managed society and, later, with apartheid.Recently, Israel\u2019s State Archive posted online a collection of documents on Israel\u2019s relationship with South Africa.[CITATION-1] The chronological framing (1961\u20137) portrays a period of transition. The editors depict the early 1960s as a low-water mark, a time of crisis;[CITATION-2] 1967, by contrast, they describe as moment of thaw, a prologue to an era of close\u2014now infamous[CITATION-3] \u2014co-operation between the Jewish state and the apartheid regime. One can, and perhaps is invited to, read what followed as a tale of aberration: a departure from first principles, a loss of moral compass on the part of Israeli diplomacy. The volume\u2019s declared purpose, notably, is to demonstrate that \u2018these relations were not always close, and [that] in the 1960s Israel took part in the international struggle against apartheid\u2019.[CITATION-4] One is invited, perhaps, also to read a necessity plea into what followed.The editors mark Israel\u2019s United Nations (UN) votes against apartheid in the early 1960s as a baseline for a \u2018growing tension, initiated by Israel\u2019.[CITATION-5] Foreign Minister (1956\u201366) Golda Meir\u2019s (1898\u20131978) impassioned denunciation of racial discrimination in South Africa at the UN General Assembly in 1963 is thus a common theme in scholarship on Israeli\u2013South African relations, South Africa\u2019s Jewish community, and Israel and Africa.[CITATION-6] Such scholarship describes Israel\u2019s UN votes against apartheid as rooted in principle rather than (merely) state interest.[CITATION-7] Principled opposition to racial discrimination was thus declared by Israel\u2019s envoys, and the literature citing them, to inhere in and express theidentity of the state.[CITATION-8] Israel, one envoy said, \u2018attached particular importance to the question of racial discrimination in general, and apartheid in particular, because of the historic experience of its own people\u2019. Jews being \u2018the victims of discrimination throughout the ages\u2019, Israel \u2018considered it both a right and a duty to take a position in the forefront of the battle against every form of discrimination, particularly racial\u2019. \u2018The Ghetto itself\u2019, he asserted, \u2018was but another form of apartheid\u2019.[CITATION-9] Israel\u2019s anti-apartheid stand itself is commonly cited to support the centrality of the Jewish aspect of Israel\u2019s foreign policy:[CITATION-10] central enough to trump even the interests of the Union of South Africa\u2019s Jewish community.[CITATION-11] Although much existing scholarship focuses on the early 1960s as the beginning of Israel\u2019s UN anti-apartheid action, some authors at times hint at continuity from an earlier decade.[CITATION-12] For her part, Meir maintained that the 1961 vote \u2018did not constitute any change of policy\u2019: Israel \u2018had already voted previously for resolutions criticising apartheid\u2019.[CITATION-13] The tension between assertions about Israel\u2019s inherent repugnance to racial discrimination and the primacy accorded to the early 1960s milestone is enough to warrant an exploration of Israel\u2019s earlier stance on apartheid. Reproducing Israel\u2019s original encounter with apartheid may help make sense of change and continuity and furnish novel vantage points from which to assess its later outlook on \u2018white\u2019 and \u2018black\u2019 Africa.Other features of the existing literature on Israel\u2019s foreign policy also suggest we should be probing more deeply. Thus, commentators who emphasise the primacy of the 1960s in Israel\u2019s anti-apartheid stand often note how principle combined with interest to shape Israel\u2019s perspective: \u2018There can be no doubt\u2019, writes Gideon Shimoni, \u2018that Israel\u2019s overriding motivation was to gain the diplomatic support of African states as counterbalance to the chronic international hostility\u2019 from Arab states and the Soviet bloc. \u2018This interest was reinforced by moral repugnance for the racism that apartheid signified\u2019.[CITATION-14] This resonates with two other features characterising nearly all accounts of Israel\u2019s involvement in Africa: Israel, these maintain, had no African policy to speak of before decolonisation began in the late 1950s.[CITATION-15] The 1955 Bandung Afro-Asian conference, paving the way for the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement, is commonly marked as a turning point. The traumatic \u2018downfall of Bandung\u2019,[CITATION-16] where Israel was first excluded, then denounced, led Moshe Sharett (1894\u20131965), Meir\u2019s predecessor, to realise the extent of Israel\u2019s isolation.[CITATION-17] African independence, beginning with Ghana in 1957, presented a remedy in the form of bilateral Israeli diplomacy in Africa in the face of expanding Nasserism.[CITATION-18] But such accounts of Israeli\u2013African relations, typically, focus on \u2018black\u2019 sub-Saharan Africa to the exclusion of \u2018white\u2019 South Africa which is treated, implicitly or explicitly, as a special case.The parallel insistence that although self-interest drove Israel\u2019s turn to Africa, ideology and identity were equal motors of diplomatic action, merits attention.[CITATION-19] Scholars and former diplomats, however, tend to gloss over the precise nature of ideological imperatives surrounding Israel\u2019s early African \u2018adventure\u2019. Nor do they engage with the roleplayed by identity in Israel\u2019s diplomatic practice. Instead, standard references to the \u2018Zionist idealism\u2019[CITATION-20] of Theodor Herzl (1860\u20141904), the founder of political Zionism, or broad-brush allusions to \u2018a higher moral purpose\u2019 of serving as a \u2018light unto the nations\u2019 are made.[CITATION-21] At times, commentators note expressions of sympathy for \u2018the liberation of other people\u2019[CITATION-22] or invocations of shared Jewish and black suffering\u2014and then they move on.[CITATION-23] Much is made of Israel\u2019s subsequent denunciation of apartheid at the UN from 1961 onwards without critical reflection on this policy\u2019s origins or pedigree.[CITATION-24] Existing historiography, finally, does not always consider Israel\u2019s early African (and South African) perspectives against the backdrop of its wider geostrategic constraints and the Jewish dimension of its foreign policy. Traditional assessments of Israel\u2019s positions on Africa and South African questions do not always take full account of the role played by geopolitics\u2014especially the Cold War\u2014and its impact on Israel\u2019s early foreign policy. Nor has much attention been paid to the role Israel\u2019s Jewish identity played in its grappling with such challenges. One cardinal principle of pre-state Zionist policy had been close alignment with a Great Power.[CITATION-25] The establishment of Israel, from the outset, raised in this respect a major foreign policy dilemma: what would be the new state\u2019s world orientation? Ought Israel now to ally with the East or the West? This was a dilemma shaped by the even more traditional, and fundamental, question of modern Jewish identity with which, after 1948, the Jewish state had to grapple in its domestic politics, society, culture and law.[CITATION-26] In foreign policy terms, the problem was exacerbated by the Cold War and compounded by Israel\u2019s own regional isolation.At first, Israel chose to avoid close alignment with either superpower; its leaders, among other considerations, had hoped to preserve that moment in 1947 when the Soviet Union, unexpectedly, moved to support the Partition of Palestine.[CITATION-27] This called for a foreign policy that would be a constant balancing act; so did Israel\u2019s reliance on the financial support of American Jewry on the one hand and its desire to have access to Jews beyond the Iron Curtain on the other.[CITATION-28] Non-alignment with the Cold War opponents became a guiding principle of Israel\u2019s early foreign policy, even when exigencies tested its imperatives to breaking-point. When the Korean crisis came in the summer 1950,[CITATION-29] Prime Minister Ben-Gurion and Foreign Minister Sharett could fend off domestic critique from the left by presenting Israel\u2019s pro-Western position as, in reality, a show of support for and expression of fidelity to the UN in its effort to curb aggression. It could be argued that this realised, rather than departed from, Israel\u2019s neutral stance.[CITATION-30] Even if Cold War circumstances forced Israel\u2019s hand, they were not seen at the time as an abandonment of the non-alignment principle.[CITATION-31] Ben-Gurion may have been inclined westwards, but Sharett\u2019s adherence to careful non-alignment and balancing continued to direct Foreign Ministry praxis and attitudes.[CITATION-32] For a while, Korea remained \u2018a singular aberration\u2019.[CITATION-33] Despite pressure on the principle\u2014perhaps because of it\u2014non-alignment became an article of faith, strongly injected with an ideological sense of purpose exceeding the vicissitudes of this or that political crisis and lingering, at least in Israel\u2019s foreign service apparatus, long after Israel had started its slow journey towards a more westward orientation.[CITATION-34] Assessments of this orientation dilemma, however, rarely delve into the crucial, constitutive role played by Israel\u2019s Jewish identity in such teleological framings of non-alignment. \u2018[O]f all the nations of the world Israel alone is not morally subjugated to this or that power struggling today for world domination\u2019, wrote Walter Eytan (1910\u20132001),[CITATION-35] the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director-General, to Sharett in September 1950, in connection with the forthcoming General Assembly session. \u2018[T]he time has come to put this state of affairs to the service of world peace \u2026 the impending \u2026 UN Assembly may present us with the opportunity to do something great and energetic in the campaign for world peace\u2019. A dilemma, read as a calling, could be turned into an opportunity. What he proposed was no less than Israel having its own candidate for the position of UN Secretary-General. What, for Eytan, made this fantastic project appear conceivable\u2014and what made the notion of non-alignment so powerful\u2014was a spiritual reading of Israel\u2019s Jewish identity and vocation:[Israel\u2019s] non-alignment policy \u2026 does not stem from considerations of utility alone but from the recesses of the Jewish soul, so deeply-rooted in the Jewish history and its prophetic destiny so that it can never identify with, or even fully align, with forces so fundamentally alien to it such as communism, Catholicism or modern capitalism. Israel is therefore the only neutral state, in the deepest sense of the word.[CITATION-36] The Cold War, the non-alignment principle, and that sense of a universal purpose for the Jewish state are crucial to the story of Israel\u2019s early attitudes towards apartheid; these attitudes, too, formed part of a larger, and constant, balancing act; they, too, turned a dilemma into an opportunity. Israel\u2019s negotiation of apartheid, as discussed later, in turn raises the need to recast the structures, geographies and pathologies of Israel\u2019s orientation dilemmas.Against this backdrop, this paper explores Israel\u2019s early UN position and practice with regard to apartheid in the years preceding its bilateral African diplomacy of the 1960s. I argue, first, that Israel\u2019s diplomatic encounter with Africa did indeed occur earlier: Israel\u2019s UN admission on 11 May 1949 compelled its diplomats to immediately reflect on, debate and decide on \u2018African\u2019 and \u2018Colonial\u2019 questions including, specifically, apartheid. Israel\u2019s multilateral diplomacy, hitherto uncharted, preceded its bilateral diplomacy. As a result, by the late 1950s Israel\u2019s envoys had already developed a rich and tested repertoire of rhetoric and praxis that could be tapped when building bilateral relations with Africa\u2019s newly independent states.Israel\u2019s first encounter with South Africa\u2019s race policies at the UN concerned the Union of South Africa\u2019s treatment of persons of Indian descent. This article explores the making and implementation of Israel\u2019s attitude on this issue. I go on to argue, secondly, that Israel approached apartheid with equivocation, which was reflected in its voting praxis; its diplomats devised and acted on a formula that, in their own words, enabled them \u2018to have our cake and eat it\u2019. This was rooted, to an appreciable degree, in orientationYet Israel\u2019s Jewish identity, constructed through the prism of its foundational ideology, had played an equally important, constitutive role in this equivocation. Apartheid presented Israel\u2019s diplomats with an intractable dilemma. Thirdly, Israel\u2019s Jewish identity, I argue, was precisely what presented and framed that dilemmawhat charted a course out of the straits; it could be and was used to compel, and then justify, contradictory courses of action. Read ideologically or culturally, elusive Jewish identity could and did elicit, for Israel\u2019s representatives, identification witha discriminated-against Indian minoritywith discriminatory white settler rule (and, in turn, repulsion from both). Ultimately, apartheid presented an opportunity to reflect on, assert and use\u2014in short, to negotiate\u2014Israel\u2019s clear, yet elusive, Jewish identity to the ends of diametrically opposed foreign policy imperatives. For Israel\u2019s early envoys, apartheid was a constraint, but also an instrument of emancipation. Lastly, I reflect on origins, agency and itineraries, demonstrating how the elasticity of Jewish identity displayed by Israel\u2019s envoys drew on sensibilities formed in South Africa by their own previous encounters with a racially managed society and with apartheid itself.Part I discusses early UN debates on South Africa\u2019s race policies; it traces the making of Israel\u2019s equivocal position in preparation for the fifth General Assembly session (1950). Part II presents Israel\u2019s equivocal praxis in that session. Part III demonstrates the persistence of equivocation practised by Israel\u2019s UN Mission during the seventh session (1952) where apartheid, in addition to the treatment of Indian persons, first appeared on the Assembly\u2019s agenda. Part IV analyses my findings, elaborates my claims, and discusses their ramifications.At the UN, Israel encountered South Africa\u2019s race policies at two junctures. Each, in its way, lent itself to reflection on the Jewish past and present. Both were approached by its envoys through the prism of Israel\u2019s professed Jewish identity. One juncture concerned South-West Africa: a German colony placed under Union mandate at the close of the First World War\u2014\u2013much like Palestine under Britain\u2014and a territory whose inhabitants were deemed not (yet) capable of facing modernity unaided.[CITATION-37] South Africa\u2019s attempt to annex South-West Africa after the Second War World met resistance at the UN;[CITATION-38] the ensuing quarrel, culminating in Namibia\u2019s eventual independence in 1992, mushroomed into decades of skirmishes about UN competences, procedures and outlook\u2014and about Union recalcitrance and the race policies it extended to that territory.The other juncture concerned the Union\u2019s treatment of its own population. This, at first, was not about the place of the disenfranchised majority in the emerging apartheid regime; it began in 1946, rather, as a complaint concerning the treatment of the relatively small minority of persons of Indian descent living in South Africa. It soon transmuted into a censure, on the world stage, of South Africa\u2019s racial segregation policy. Both causes largely involved the same actors, interests and dilemmas; later, they would often converge. This article, however, focuses on the Indian complaint, which led in due course to apartheid becoming an item on the General Assembly\u2019s agenda. Race discrimination\u2014evoking Israel\u2019s Jewish sensibilities\u2014was, moreover, the issue explicitly underlying the dispute from its outset.[CITATION-39] Israel was admitted to the UN on 11 May 1949.[CITATION-40] Three days later, it supported a General Assembly Resolution on \u2018The Treatment of People of Indian Origin in the Union of South Africa\u2019 despite the Union\u2019s request that it abstain.[CITATION-41] South Africa was the only state to vote against the resolution, which invited India, Pakistan and the Union \u2018to enter into discussion at a round-table conference\u2019.[CITATION-42] Modest in scope, this resolution was the latest round of India\u2019s campaign against the Union\u2019s race policies towards its Indian population.[CITATION-43] What had begun in 1946 as a continuation of inter-imperial politics would become, over the next decades, a campaign against apartheid.[CITATION-44] The issue of the treatment of the Union\u2019s Indian population would herald an anti-colonial struggle at the world organisation; in the process, some of the fundamental assumptions of the UN founders would be reinterpreted, cast aside or reversed.[CITATION-45] The UN itself would be radically transformed; it was a time to take sides.Israel\u2019s May 1949 votes on South African and other colonial questions were instinctive, not calculated.[CITATION-46] They caused \u2018considerable embarrassment\u2019: \u2018we did not fully know the problems, and so our appearance was an improvisation; the consequences followed\u2019. Israel\u2019s intervention in the debate \u2018raised the wrath of the former colonial states so that in the end, we needed to absent ourselves from the meetings of the committee\u2019.[CITATION-47] Later that month Michael Comay (1908\u201387), the Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Commonwealth Division, confided to Abba Eban (1915\u20132002), Israel\u2019s UN Permanent Representative, that he had not yet had a \u2018chance to hear from [Foreign Minister] Moshe [Sharett] the reasons for our decision to support a resolution against South Africa in this matter\u2019. Careful not to criticise merits, Comay stressed the need for closer future co-ordination between the Israel\u2019s UN Mission and the responsible MFA Division. He also implied that the impact on Zionist fundraising in South Africa and on the impending diplomatic relations might have not been given proper weight.[CITATION-48] The episode exposed Israel\u2019s basic dilemma. \u2018Our complication\u2019, wrote Eban to the MFA\u2019s Director-General, was \u2018friendship [with] South Africa\u2019 on the one hand and, on the other, Israel\u2019s \u2018attitude [to] colonial questions\u2019.[CITATION-49] Perplexingly, already in late 1949 Israeli diplomats were alluding to a \u2018tradition of voting on colonial and trusteeship questions together with the Asiatic and Latin American bloc\u2019.[CITATION-50] Preparing for the next General Assembly, Ezekiel Gordon (1905\u201362), Director of the MFA\u2019s International Organisations Department, reflected: \u2018we must avoid blindly following principles and sentiments. Obviously, it is in our nature that our sympathies lie with colonised and oppressed peoples. At the same time, identifying ourselves with them means hostility to friendly countries such as France and South Africa \u2026 [we] must always act with care\u2019.[CITATION-51] Both India and the Union were already lobbying Israel\u2019s UN Mission.[CITATION-52] Israel\u2019s dilemma persisted, unresolved. Preliminary discussions in early 1950 led to an agreement to hold a round-table conference. In April, however, South Africa published the Group Areas Bill, providing for complete racial segregation.[CITATION-53] After mutual accusations, India withdrew from the planned conference. The only subject of discussion, according to South Africa, would have been \u2018the reduction of the Indian population in South Africa\u2019 through \u2018repatriation\u2019.[CITATION-54] India placed the item on the Assembly agenda.Early in August, the International Organisations Department (IOD) prepared a single-page memorandum on the question.[CITATION-55] It offered \u2018compelling arguments\u2019 supporting the \u2018Indian point of view\u2019. First was the \u2018compelling\u2019 \u2018moral problem\u2019: \u2018[t]he only parallel in modern times to such far reaching racial legislation are the Nazi Nuremberg laws\u2019.[CITATION-56] This was precisely what India\u2019s 1946 complaint had argued: \u2018a striking resemblance to the Nazi principle and practice of race superiority and concentration of power in the superior race\u2019.[CITATION-57] The ensuing question may have been implicit, but abundantly clear: how could the Jewish state stand aside? There was, too, a prospective aspect to the \u2018Jewish point of view\u2019: \u2018the problem of protecting ethnic and national minorities \u2026 especially when \u2026 nationals of the persecuting state\u2019.[CITATION-58] Any race-based rule could not bode well, in other words, for (South Africa\u2019s) Jews. There was aadvantage, too: by supporting India, Israel would \u2018be allied with a solid majority\u2019 together with \u2018the Latin American, Asiatic, Arabic and Soviet Bloc countries, plus countries such as Ethiopia and Liberia and probably the United States and the Scandinavian countries\u2019.[CITATION-59] For a new state still seeking to overcome isolation this, in itself, was an important end.Other factors, however, militated against supporting India. Intervention was \u2018a double edged sword\u2019: India\u2019s victory would \u2018create a precedent for Israel\u2019s intervention on behalf of the Jews in other countries\u2019 but, alas, also for \u2018Arab intervention on behalf of the Arab minority in Israel\u2019. Voting with India could upset \u2018the delicate nature of Israel\u2019s relations\u2019 with South Africa and endanger the latter\u2019s support on the question of Jerusalem\u2019s status. On balance, the author concluded: \u2018Israel is morally bound to support the Indian case because of her interests in so far as world Jewry are concerned\u2019. His recommendation, however, was far less categorical: owing to constraining factors, \u2018Israel should abstain from indulging in attacks upon South Africa but should explain its vote as a vote of principle against discrimination\u2019.[CITATION-60] This recommendation gained the \u2018full support\u2019 of the MFA\u2019s Asia Department.[CITATION-61] Comay, however, was not convinced. He consulted Jacob Robinson (1889\u20131977), the UN Mission legal adviser,[CITATION-62] and the MFA legal adviser Shabtai Rosenne (1917\u20132010) on \u2018The problem of Southern Africa in the next UN Assembly\u2019. Rosenne, who normally eschewed allusions to sentiments or moral obligations in the international sphere,[CITATION-63] considered this \u2018one of the most complex [problems] and it would be very dangerous to approach it dogmatically and with prejudice\u2019.[CITATION-64] He did approach it with a mixture ofsentiment and prejudice when averring that \u2018we cannot disregard the difference in our relationship towards South Africa and our relationship towards India and Pakistan. As for these two states we owe nothing\u2019.[CITATION-65] Both voted against the partition of Palestine. Pakistan was Muslim, objected to Israel\u2019s UN admission, and ignored its request for recognition. India met Israel\u2019s early diplomatic overtures coolly.[CITATION-66] Past ties of the South African ruling National Party to Nazi Germany were not enough to outweigh the adverse role played by India and Pakistan in the partition debate. South Africa had not only voted for partition; it also was among the first to recognise Israel.[CITATION-67] Comay was given the task of proposing a position, contained in \u2018observations\u2019 on the IOD memorandum.[CITATION-68] He admitted that the \u2018broad moral argument\u2019 was \u2018certainly compelling\u2019; nonetheless, he wished to accentuate several factors suggesting an even more \u2018cautious approach\u2019. He elaborated on the double-edge of \u2018intervention\u2019; and intimated that alignment with India \u2018might seriously prejudice [the Union\u2019s Jewish] community\u2019. On \u2018The Interests of South African Jewry\u2019 he delivered the \u2018considered view of the South African Zionist Executive \u2026 privately conveyed to me, but not directly to the Foreign Minister \u2026 because the South African Jews do not want to be accused of interfering with Israel\u2019s foreign policy\u2019. According to \u2018responsible leaders\u2019, Comay explained, South Africa\u2019s race issue was not \u2018a question of \u201cminorities\u201d in the normal European sense, but of the fundamental colour cleavage\u2019. South Africa\u2019s Jewry wished to refrain from \u2018becoming associated with the struggles of the coloured groups against white domination\u2019 so as to maintain \u2018as long as [they] can\u2019 the \u2018privileged position\u2019 of \u2018being accepted as an integral part of the white section of the population\u2019. These sentiments, Comay noted, may appear \u2018unheroic\u2019 but, he implied, were understandable.[CITATION-69] Comay proceeded to reflect on Israel\u2019s alignments: \u2018Can we remain indifferent to the fact that South Africa has consistently supported our cause, while India and Pakistan have backed our enemies, and still refuse to recognise us even de facto?\u2019, he asked. Accepting that Israel \u2018must establish relations with the Asiatic countries\u2019, he urged that this could not happen through attacking \u2018those who have befriended us\u2019.[CITATION-70] Comay could speak with some personal authority on this subject. He was born in Cape Town; after the Second World War, he had served as the Palestine representative of the South African Zionist Federation for the Jewish Agency\u2019s Political Department\u2014the MFA\u2019s predecessor.[CITATION-71] His background was pertinent to the next section of the memorandum.Discussing the \u2018The Merits of the Dispute\u2019, Comay pleaded for contextual understanding of South Africa\u2019s race issues. He had already argued this was nothing like the Jewish experience as a European \u2018minority\u2019, but rather a \u2018fundamental colour cleavage\u2019. The \u2018fundamental point\u2019, he now asserted, was \u2018that this problem cannot be taken out of context of the South African situation as a whole\u2019: though small, the Union\u2019s Indian community was \u2018concentrated in and around Durban\u2019, where \u2018100,000 Indians \u2026 outnumber the white population of the city\u2019. Even before the Union, \u2018the other Colonies had taken steps to prevent the spreading from Natal into their areas\u2019. This \u2018local concentration\u2019 explained \u2018why so much heat has been engendered by this problem\u2019.[CITATION-72] Comay found it \u2018interesting\u2019 that segregation of the Indian community was not an Afrikaner but a British concern: \u2018Natal is the most English province of the Union, and the whites who demand tough measures against Indian \u201cpenetration\u201d are not the Afrikaners of Malan\u2019s National Party, butmost \u201cBritish\u201d section of Smut\u2019s Union Party\u2019.[CITATION-73] The \u2018powerful anti-Indian prejudice\u2019 of the Natal English translated into \u2018a natural sympathy for the repressive policies of the present government.\u2019 This allowed Malanites to argue, Comay added, that \u2018racialism in South Africa\u2019 is not an \u2018Afrikaner invention\u2019.[CITATION-74] Comay moved on to expound on the complexity of the Natal racial situation. The Indian problem, he noted, was not just \u2018an Indian\u2013white conflict\u2019. It was \u2018also an Indian\u2013black conflict\u2019. He went on to describe the position of Natal Indians in the vocabulary of European anti-Semitism\u2014a comparison he had already refuted:The Indians are the traders and middlemen for the native peasantry and proletariat; as such, they are regarded as exploiters, and dislike and distrust can explode into such bloody outbreaks as that which took place in Durban last year, when African mobs killed and wounded hundreds of Indians, and pillaged their shops and homes.[CITATION-75] Though Comay did not use the word \u2018pogrom\u2019, the subtext was clear: if the Union\u2019s Jews were now white, the Indians were now its Jews. He asserted the analogy explicitly: \u2018This is a kind of \u201canti-Semitism\u201d reminiscent of the traditional Jewish position in Eastern Europe\u2014except that in Durban there is a racial triangle: European\u2013Asiatic\u2013African\u2019.[CITATION-76] The analogy, however, was not meant to draw the Jewish state\u2019s sympathies to the \u2018Jewish\u2019 plight of Natal Indians, but to plead for contextual sensitivity. If the Jews of South Africa were white and European, then the Jewish state could demand and expect the same kind of contextualised understanding of its own policies as was required by the complexity of the South African situation. Just as South Africa\u2019s policies were to be understood in their proper African context, not judged by standards applicable in the West, so ought Israel\u2019s actions in the Middle East be understood. But the analogy in fact distinguished Jews from Indians. Here Comay located the uniqueness of the South African situation\u2014and Israel\u2019s\u2014squarely within the civilisational sensibilities of nineteeth-century international liberalism:[CITATION-77] On the Palestine problem, we used to protest loudly against the superficial logic of majority rule, claiming that the situation had certain unique features, which had to be properly analysed and understood before any remedies could be discussed.Similarly, without condoning the gross inequalities and injustices of the South African system, one can submit that such a multi-racial society, with different communities existing on different planes of civilisation, presents special problems, the solutions to which dolie in the mechanical equality of the ballot box. Not even the most liberal and progressive South African opinion has ever advocated the kind of \u2018democracy\u2019 which functions more or less successfully in advanced and homogenous Western countries. Even a measure of \u2018apartheid\u2019 (segregation) may be justifiable as a device for damping down racial friction by reducing inter-penetration of the various communities\u2026 one of the existing forms of segregation \u2026 prohibitssettlement or land ownership in substantial (though inadequate) areas \u2026 set aside as native reserves.[CITATION-78] Comay\u2019s recourse to civilisational vernacular suggested that if there was an analogy with South Africa, its lesson was not the similarity between Jews and Indians. The point, to which I shall return below, was rather that Jews\u2014especially, perhaps, Jews in Israel\u2014had shared the same \u2018plane of civilisation\u2019 with European and whites.How did all this bear on the position that Israel was to take at the UN? First, Comay suggested circumspection: \u2018be prepared to reaffirm our general principles \u2026 if the occasion calls for it\u2019\u2014but also \u2018hesitate to attack particular features of the race complex in South Africa, of which we in Israel have little understanding, and for which we have no constructive solution to offer\u2019. Israel\u2019s dilemma should not be reduced \u2018to a simple formula of principle versus expedience\u2019. But he was forced to admit: \u2018it is not easy to suggest a middle line\u2019. Comay tried nonetheless: Israel could well support reiterated calls for \u2018a round-table conference\u2019; this \u2018would chime in with our own demand that Israel and the Arab states should settle their difference by direct negotiations\u2019. But if called on to vote on censure of South Africa or condemn its policies, Israel should abstain, citing \u2018our general reluctance to join in censure of parties to U.N. disputes\u2019. Nor was Comay keen on supporting renewed Indian proposals to implement \u2018the principle of U.N. intervention in cases of alleged discrimination against a minority group\u2019 through, for example, the establishment of a \u2018Committee of Enquiry\u2019. In the absence of \u2018a legal basis for such action\u2019, he recommended that Israel should not support (or should even abstain on) such proposals, \u2018on the grounds that, in the face of South Africa\u2019s attitude\u2019, the likely ineffectiveness of such mechanism would only \u2018create a fresh bone of contention\u2019.[CITATION-79] Abstention, for Comay, should be qualified by an explanation denying \u2018insensitivity on our part to the basic moral issues\u2019, even if \u2018we may be charged with being inconsistent, even hypocritical\u2019 by taking a moral high ground and \u2018refusing to apply\u2019 \u2018high sounding principles\u2019 in \u2018this test case\u2019. This was a price he was willing to pay \u2018if we want to have our cake and eat it\u2019. To realise this feat, he appended a short draft statement.[CITATION-80] Comay emphasised that he was not defending \u2018South Africa\u2019s race policies\u2019, though he invoked the personal knowledge that others did not possess. His counterparts and superiors, apparently, accepted his arguments and shared his perspective. Sharett was \u2018very impressed\u2019 with Comay\u2019s analysis: \u2018I have no doubt we must look for a way out of this strait following the lines [Comay] demarcated\u2019.[CITATION-81] A meeting of MFA departments heads in late August produced an agreed position, a recipe for having \u2018our cake and eat[ing] it\u2019.[CITATION-82] It assumed the General Assembly would debate censure of South Africa; a postponement in the implementation of the Group Areas Act; and a call to South Africa and India to reach agreement. It was recommended that Israel vote against censure, alluding to a general policy of avoiding denunciation of UN members and finding, instead, practical solutions. Should the censure clause fail to gain support, Israel would support the resolution as a whole. Were India to vote against the resolution because it contained no censure clause, Israel ought to abstain \u2018so as not to remain alone with the colonial bloc\u2019. Following the same line of reasoning, were the censure clause to succeed, Israel should also support the resolution as a whole. On the other hand, Israel would abstain if a clause demanding the postponement of the Group Areas Act were to come to a vote, lest a precedent for Arab demands be established.[CITATION-83] In any case, Israel ought to support any compromise and any call for direct negotiations.[CITATION-84] This agreed position \u2018in due course became part of the directive to the Israel delegation\u2019 to the UN.[CITATION-85] Comay, wishing to test the water and garner support for circumspection, sought the input of David Goitein (1900\u201361), Israel\u2019s senior representative in South Africa, on \u2018the attitude that the Union Government is likely to take up at the Assembly on the questions of the Indian minority \u2026 and of S.W.A. [South West Africa]\u2019.[CITATION-86] Summarising the Foreign Ministry\u2019s position on \u2018India and S.W.A. at the U.N.\u2019 in October 1950, Comay averred:Our attitude on the S.A. Indian question is torefrain from condemnation of South Africa, and from passing any judgment on the specific merits of the issues, or justifying the Indian refusal to attend a round-table conference \u2026 On the other hand, we can and should refrain from any express or implied support for the South African\u2014not only as a matter of general principle, but even, from the long range point of view, in the interests of the South African Jewish community itself.[CITATION-87] Comay\u2019s curious choice of words (\u2018caste system\u2019) merits a closer look. Both Goitein\u2019s discussions with the Union government and Comey\u2019s deployment of vocabulary will be discussed in more detail below. Here, it is sufficient to note that Comey expressed distaste of India, implied bad faith on its part, and questioned its standing in the debate on race.There was little qualitative difference, in effect, between Comay\u2019s position and that advocated by the IOD in August 1950. Both sought to reconcile similar conflicting concerns through similar prescriptions. The latter\u2019s recommendation was far less categorical than its allusion to principle had suggested: \u2018Israel should abstain from indulging in attacks\u2019 on South Africa, but should explain its action as a \u2018vote of principle against discrimination\u2019.[CITATION-88] The position emerging from the MFA in late August 1950 was a recipe for equivocation: support this, object to that, abstain when possible, absent yourself if necessary.[CITATION-89] Walk between the lines, and always \u2018explain\u2019\u2014that is, equivocate on\u2014the gap separating principle from praxis: to India, to South Africa, to the Jewish community, and so on. It was designed to justify a broad range of possible actions tilting this way or that. It was, on the one hand, too rigid for Israel\u2019s UN Mission to be able to follow closely in practice: not every procedural device used or substantive turn in UN debates could be foreseen.[CITATION-90] It was, on the other hand, flexible and useful enough for it to be consecrated as the Ministry\u2019s formula for approaching UN debates on South Africa\u2019s race policies in future years. Leaving final judgment to Israel\u2019s UN Mission became the bottom line of instructions issued in preparation for successive Assembly sessions.[CITATION-91] Starting in the fifth General Assembly session, Israel\u2019s UN Mission proceeded to implement this position in multiple votes, in statements made by its representatives, and in a few amendments which they introduced. Consider one 1950 statement in thePolitical Committee, delivered by a member of Israel\u2019s UN mission. Having \u2018listened with interest and sympathy\u2019 to India\u2019s statement, Samuel Eliashiv (1899\u20141955)[CITATION-92] noted:The people of Israel are compelled by their own memories of anguish and pain to take interest in any disputes arising from allegations of racial discrimination. We cannot therefore accept the view that the United Nations should disinterest itself in any question of that kind.[CITATION-93] That was, clearly, a point scored for India: South Africa consistently challenged UN competence.Next, however, came an \u2018urgent appeal\u2019 to India to \u2018reconsider its attitude\u2019 and \u2018make a further effort towards a solution through \u2026 negotiation \u2026 In our view and experience \u2026 direct negotiation is indispensible to any hope of a settlement\u2019 and \u2018the most effective course\u2019 of action. This advanced Israel\u2019s own position on how to resolve the Middle East conflict; but it contained, at the same time, a veiled criticism of India. For all of Israel\u2019s \u2018interest and sympathy\u2019, Eliashiv\u2019s statement hinted that blame for the impasse rested with India: it was up to her to make a \u2018further effort\u2019. By stressing that preparations were already made for the conference, Eliashiv implicitly rebuked the \u2018considerations which induced\u2019 India to withdraw its assent.[CITATION-94] Towards the Union government, rather than \u2018urgent appeal\u2019, Eliashiv only expressed \u2018the hope\u2019 that it will \u2018do all in its power to create an atmosphere\u2019 necessary to allow the conference to succeed.[CITATION-95] The overall emphasis on process also directed attention away from the substance of the Group Areas Act: two points scored for the Union. When matters came to a vote, Israel supported the call to South Africa to delay implementation of the Group Areas Act.[CITATION-96] A point for India: deuce. Eliashiv, notably, did not consider that this amounted to taking a stand against apartheid. He reported:We have followed no side. We did what we could to help take stings out of the [Indian] proposal. We know that the Indians \u2026 were again this time happy with our position\u2026 The South African delegation saw our efforts to soften the substance of the proposal and its language in consideration of them\u2026[CITATION-97] Israel\u2019s principled opposition to racial discrimination was, effectively, more rhetorical than operational.Comay agreed with Eliashiv\u2019s statement but thought that Israel\u2019s votes were cast \u2018in a way which went beyond the [August 1950] directive\u2019. Israel\u2019s support for a draft resolution proposed jointly by Bolivia, Brazil and the Scandinavian countries in the Committee \u2018identified us with the opponents of South Africa\u2019 and placed Israel in the \u2018anti-colonial bloc\u2019.[CITATION-98] Abstaining, he thought, would have placed Israel together with several Asian, Latin American and European states. When Jewish leaders in South Africa intimated \u2018unofficially\u2019 that Israel should have abstained on the suspension of the Act rather than \u2018tread on the toes of South Africa\u2019,[CITATION-99] Comay thought that \u2018they should realise how impossible it is for Israel to adopt a neutral or equivocal attitude over a precedent for UN concerning itself with charges of discrimination.\u2019[CITATION-100] Israel, Comay added, \u2018had to find a compromise between our principles and convictions on matters of racialism, and our desire to maintain friendship with South Africa\u2019.[CITATION-101] The formula justified even what Comay considered a departure; before the next Assembly, he would propose that that \u2018moderate, middle-of-the-road line\u2019, \u2018be reaffirmed as a general directive\u2019 for the future.[CITATION-102] Israel\u2019s UN Mission continued to practice equivocation, sometimes by voting one way in one body, then another way in the other. At times, equivocation was manifest in shifts from one session of the Assembly to the next. Following the Sixth Assembly the IOD lamented that the South Africans did not \u2018clearly appreciate\u2019 Israel\u2019s vote.There was hardly any other possibility for us to act, caught as we were between the impossibility of sanctioning racial discrimination (which we would have done even if we had merely abstained in the voting) and the necessity of safeguarding our good relations with South Africa and the interests of its Jewish population.[CITATION-103] In October 1951, a senior staff meeting repeated the formula: \u2018Israel will not support any proposal condemning South Africa\u2019 and \u2018will support any proposal aspiring to bring direct negotiations between the parties to resolve the problem\u2019.[CITATION-104] This time, however, Israel \u2018abstained, both in committee and in the Plenary, on the paragraph calling on the South African Government to suspend the implementation of the Group Areas Act\u2019.[CITATION-105] Notwithstanding the Act\u2019s implementation \u2018contrary to the United Nations resolution\u2019, the imperative was \u2018to uphold principles and yet avoid giving support to any resolution which might be interpreted as condemning South Africa\u2019s conduct\u2019.[CITATION-106] This was balanced by voting \u2018in favour of the resolution as a whole\u2019, rather than abstaining. Israel also proposed an amendment that \u2018softened considerably the original\u2019 proposal.[CITATION-107] In effect, Israel added its voice against racial discrimination, but would not vote against the enforcement of the policies entrenching it.[CITATION-108] It also stated that fault for failed talks should not be placed with South Africa alone.[CITATION-109] When its delegates did vote against the Union, they usually joined large majorities; at times, they gave voice to principle when voting on matters of procedure.[CITATION-110] Equivocation often proved itself usefulthe Union government[CITATION-111] and the Jewish South African community: Israel\u2019s representative in Pretoria could confirm in mid-1952 that \u2018our [UN] delegation at the next Assembly may safely continue to deal with the South African questions \u2026 on the same line as at the last\u2019.[CITATION-112] In 1952, India realised it could not demand equality for a small, recently disenfranchised Indian minority yet remain silent on the systemic disenfranchisement of the African majority. \u2018The question of race conflict in South Africa resulting from the policies of apartheid of the Government of the Union of South Africa\u2019 was added to the General Assembly agenda.[CITATION-113] The new item exacerbated Israel\u2019s dilemma. In September, Avraham Harman (1914\u201492)[CITATION-114] foresaw \u2018an acute moral test\u2019 regarding \u2018racial discrimination\u2019. \u2018[I]n some cases\u2019, he noted, \u2018we may be required to vote against our conscience\u2019; these votes would have to be compensated for in the general debate.[CITATION-115] The IOD, reviewing past practice and putative developments, extended the formula adopted in previous years to cover the new agenda item.[CITATION-116] \u2018[T]here is no need to change the line we have taken\u2019 in previous sessions, wrote one department head. Cecil Hyman, Israel\u2019s Minister in Pretoria, agreed.[CITATION-117] Circumstances, nonetheless, compounded complexity. In preparation for the Assembly, the IOD assessed factors justifying or militating against Israeli involvement. The latter included Israel\u2019s interest that the \u2018UN right to discuss questions of minorities\u2019 be recognised, so as to protect the rights of Jewish minorities; and the realisation that \u2018Israel cannot stand by South Africa\u2019s side against the majority of UN members\u2019.[CITATION-118] Hyman reported that the Nationalist government was developing an \u2018intransigent mood\u2019, treating the UN defiantly \u2018largely with an eye to the coming [1953] elections\u2019. \u2018I do not see how we can avoid finally coming out openly against South Africa after having tried \u2026 long \u2026 [to] seek a settlement\u2019.[CITATION-119] On the Middle East front, Israel launched an initiative to have the UN call on all parties to enter direct negotiations;[CITATION-120] this required the goodwill of the Asian and Latin American blocs;[CITATION-121] an emerging relationship with France dictated sensitivity to French North African interests.[CITATION-122] A senior-level discussion at the MFA in early October applied the formula to circumstances. On the \u2018South African Questions\u2019\u2014\u2018discrimination of Indians \u2026 annexation of South-West Africa \u2026 race laws\u2019\u2014it was decided:1. Not to accept South Africa\u2019s view that the UN cannot discuss the question of the Indians and South-West Africa.2. To take a line opposite to South Africa that will demonstrate our active opposition to its policy (not to abstain). Nevertheless, extremism should be avoided.[CITATION-123] The need towas emphasised:In all three questions we must demonstrate that we do not justify disregard for the UN and lack of will of compromise. Here we should support the softening of denunciation on the question of the Indians but \u2026 not be deterred from defining that there is injustice involved. We should support compromise on the question of South-West Africa \u2026 If this has no prospects, we should demonstrate non-alignment with South Africa. We should support compromise on the question of race laws ... If no compromise is accepted by South Africa, we should not avoid confrontation.The decisions stem from recognition of the injustice done and from the desire of Israel to preserve its own right and the right of the UN to intervene on behalf of minorities.\u2026 [W]e should explain to the Asians that our relationship with South Africa and the position of the Jews there deny us the possibility of supporting extreme denunciation proposals.[CITATION-124] In short, circumstances dictated some display both of hardening the line against the Union and of supporting a \u2018compromise on the question of race laws\u2019. The decision prescribed equivocation along the familiar lines of the traditional formula.At the UN plenary session, the Union denied the competence of the UN to address policies that fell entirely within its domestic jurisdiction. This \u2018evoked [a] tremendous morning long debate\u2019. Israel abstained on the \u2018Chairman\u2019s ruling that Assembly vote immediately on Assembly\u2019s competence to deal with South African Apartheid\u2019. The ruling was defeated; Israel \u2018didn\u2019t want to express definite opinions on [the] chairman\u2019s ruling\u2019, there being an opportunity to discuss competence in committee.[CITATION-125] Next, Israel objected, against the Union and with a large majority, to deleting the item from the agenda,[CITATION-126] citing the \u2018principle [that] no items should be excluded [from UN] agenda\u2019.[CITATION-127] The item was referred to thePolitical Committee.There, at first, Israel kept its distance. Its representatives abstained on a proposal to discuss both South African items immediately because they \u2018believed no useful purpose\u2019 could be served by them \u2018entering the discussion\u2019.[CITATION-128] When the item was discussed, an eighteen-member draft resolution proposed to establish a commission \u2018to study and examine the international aspects and implications of the racial situation in the Union of South Africa in the light of the purposes and principles of the Charter\u2019 and UN resolutions on \u2018racial persecution and discrimination\u2019.[CITATION-129] Israel\u2019s UN Mission was reluctant to engage in the debate on the proposal by \u201818 undeveloped states, including Yemen\u2019:Israel finds it hard not to vote for denunciation of the persecution, but on the other hand our heart is not won by the fathers of that resolution, on grounds of \u2018cast out first the beam out of thine own eye\u2019. \u2026 [W]e should intervene briefly in the debate and explain Israel\u2019s vote against the backdrop of a reservation concerning how this problem is being dealt with and perpetuated on the UN agenda, while identifying with the negation of the persecutions.[CITATION-130] A statement to this effect was read on 18 November by Eliashiv. What \u2018must guide [Israel\u2019s] policy in any case \u2026 [involving] the issue of [racial] discrimination\u2019 is \u2018our own history and \u2026 [the] general principle\u2019, he said. \u2018[I]n the course of their long history\u2019 he elaborated, \u2018the Jewish people have known only too intimately the full meaning of racial discrimination and are sensitive to its implications wherever they occur\u2019.[CITATION-131] Twice he referenced \u2018the same approach\u2019 Israel displayed on the question of treatment of Indians. He also argued, however, that the two agenda items ought to be treated differently. Israel\u2019s support for the Indian resolution on \u2018treatment\u2019 was justified by \u2018the existence of international agreements\u2019. Apartheid, however, was different. UN deliberations, Eliashiv argued, should be marked by \u2018the desire to bring racial discrimination to an end\u2019;[CITATION-132] they should not, however, encroach on South African sovereignty: \u2018It can be no part of our purpose to offend the susceptibilities of a sovereign country\u2014a country with which my own country maintains, and will we trust, continue to maintain friendly relations\u2019.[CITATION-133] Formally, this was closer to South Africa\u2019s position. Substantively and rhetorically, however, it signified that Israel was more sensitive to the discrimination against the Indian minority than to the segregation of the African majority.Eliashiv continued the balancing act, observing next that \u2018once the problem of racial discrimination is raised it is difficult to limit\u2019 discussion to \u2018the one particular country mentioned in the draft\u2019. He warned against casting stones, intimating that censure can be directed \u2018perhaps even against\u2019 the resolution\u2019s co-sponsors.[CITATION-134] On the maze of drafts and amendments before the committee, Eliashiv outlined Israel\u2019s position: he rejected, on legal grounds, South African\u2019s view that the UN was \u2018not competent to consider this problem\u2019: UN concern \u2018with the problem of racial discrimination is under the charter an absolute interest, not conditioned in any way by whether such discrimination has or does not have international implications\u2019. Still, he went on, Israel\u2019s vote would seek to ensure that the UN was \u2018remaining within the scope of its authority\u2019.[CITATION-135] Israel, he announced, would vote against the South African draft resolution;[CITATION-136] but he emphasised the \u2018due regard\u2019 to be given, in the work of the proposed commission, to Article 2(7) of the Charter; this non-intervention clause was the Union\u2019s first\u2014and main\u2014line of defence.[CITATION-137] This, he reported, was \u2018designed to make things smoother for the South African government\u2019.[CITATION-138] The effort to appease South Africa continued. The next day, Eliashiv introduced an amendment to the eighteen-power draft that would have had the proposed commission report to the Secretary-General, not the General Assembly, in order to preclude \u2018automatic perpetuation\u2019 or renewal of the debate.[CITATION-139] Equivocation persisted in Israel\u2019s votes. On 20 November, it voted against the Union\u2019s motion \u2018claiming UN incompetence\u2019. On the revised eighteen-power joint draft resolution, Israel voted in favour of two paragraphs of the preamble, but abstained on the third and fourth. With regard to the operative part of the proposal, Israel abstained on a USSR amendment but supported its own.[CITATION-140] It voted for three operative paragraphs but against a fourth that would retain the item on the General Assembly\u2019s agenda. It did support the draft resolution as a whole.[CITATION-141] The Dutch, the only supporter of Israel\u2019s amendment, were also South Africa\u2019s \u2018most fervent defender\u2019.[CITATION-142] A Scandinavian joint draft resolution would have replaced the operational text of the draft establishing a commission to study the situation, with the abstract statement that governmental policies \u2018designed to perpetuate or increase discrimination\u2019 were inconsistent with the Charter \u2018pledges\u2019 of member states. Not mentioning South Africa, it de-emphasised race and offered the Union only a mild, indirect and implicit rebuke.[CITATION-143] It sought to mitigate the effects of the eighteen-power resolution: \u2018Western Powers\u2019, the British Commonwealth and some Latin American States were \u2018making valiant attempts [to] soften [the] South African blow [by] approving [the] Scandinavian approach\u2019 which \u2018indicated reluctance to brand South Africa outright as open transgressor\u2019.[CITATION-144] The Scandinavian proposal even included, in Paragraph 4, language on differential implementation\u2014implicitly, but plainly, on racial grounds\u2014allowing South Africa to claim justified exception.[CITATION-145] Israel abstained on the three paragraphs in the preamble containing an \u2018implicit\u2019 denunciation of South Africa,[CITATION-146] but voted against the (defeated) differential implementation paragraph.[CITATION-147] Still, it supported every paragraph of the operative text, and the resolution as a whole.[CITATION-148] Its representative \u2018stressed the need for clean hands by all those protesting against discrimination in South Africa\u2019.[CITATION-149] The Union, now threatening to walk out of the debate, did not appreciate Israel\u2019s balancing act. Before the matter reverted to the plenary session, its representative asked Abba Eban to reconsider and \u2018warned severely\u2019 against Israel repeating its Committee votes.[CITATION-150] At the plenary session, Israel voted against the South African motion on UN competence. It voted in favour of all parts of the Resolution recommended by theCommittee, emanating from the eighteen-power draft, to establish a commission to study the racial situation in the Union. The other, \u2018Scandinavian\u2019 resolution, called on all member states \u2018to bring their policies into conformity with their obligations under the Charter to promote the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms\u2019. Israel voted for the first paragraph of the preamble of that second resolution but, apparently, it did not cast its vote on the text of the Resolution as a whole.[CITATION-151] The General Assembly adopted both.[CITATION-152] The Israeli Mission may have ended up more active than planned, but it did not consider its seventh session votes to be innovative.[CITATION-153] Israel\u2019s attitude was \u2018consistent\u2019, wrote Eliashiv.[CITATION-154] The votes \u2018on the questions of North and South Africa in the political committees\u2019, the Mission thought, expressed a \u2018conservative position\u2019. It resolved, \u2018\u201catoning\u201d somewhat\u2019 for this, to demonstrate a more anti-colonial position next time. This would \u2018perhaps create a bridgehead to the Asians and Latins at the Fourth Committee\u2019.[CITATION-155] Overall, for all its equivocation, Israel\u2019s words and deeds at the assembly were considerably more progressive than those uttered or practised by many Western states. Still, the balancing act allowed Israel\u2019s votes to be interpreted, and presented, both ways. One could emphasise making \u2018things smoother\u2019 and \u2018softening the blow\u2019 for the Union in response, for example, to allegations voiced by the South African press that criticised Israel for supporting not only \u2018India on the Indian questions\u2019 but also an \u2018Asiatic\u2013Arab\u2019 proposal on apartheid (when Israel, according to the South African press, could have sided with the Western \u2018middle-course\u2019 proposal). \u2018Of all the votes on South African affairs\u2019, the Cape daily National Party mouthpieceaverred, that of the \u2018young state of Israel caused the biggest surprise\u2019.[CITATION-156] The formula could equally encounter reproach from some South African Jews: \u2018Mr. Kluk of Cape Town\u2019 (apparently a National Party member)[CITATION-157] considered Israel\u2019s \u2018inexplicable stand\u2019 a \u2018strike at the moral foundations of the Western block\u2019.[CITATION-158] Hyman, Israel\u2019s Minister in Pretoria, considered Israel\u2019s attitude \u2018diametrically opposed to that of the Union\u2019. \u2018[O]ur delegation\u2019, he observed, had \u2018no other possibility \u2026 than to take a stand against South Africa\u2019. \u2018White \u201cbaas-kap\u201d (mastery)\u2019, he wrote, \u2018is the expressed cardinal principle of\u2019 the \u2018racialist\u2019 Government.[CITATION-159] At the UN, Eban could rebuke Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, India\u2019s formidable representative (and Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s sister), for India\u2019s vote against Israel\u2019s direct negotiations initiative by noting that Israel \u2018has supported India\u2019s campaign against racial discrimination in South Africa at the cost of arousing many powerful antagonisms\u2019.[CITATION-160] The prescription of equivocation had proved its elasticity and utility: the preparations for the eighth session recommended that \u2018this line should persist\u2019.[CITATION-161] Israel\u2019s diplomatic encounter with Africa preceded the Bandung conference of 1955 and onset of African independence and decolonisation. It occurred at the UN, in debates on South Africa\u2019s race policies and on the future of colonial rule. There would be more than echoes of this first encounter in Israel\u2019s anti-apartheid denunciatory speeches of the early 1960s. Israel\u2019s association with South Africa from the late 1960s onwards also had some prior UN history\u2014notwithstanding the general aversion its envoys felt for racial principles and policies, and the fact that Israel\u2019s equivocation in the late 1940s and early 1950s did not amount to the shield which most Western countries provided for South Africa. Many of the arguments put forward in the 1960s had been rehearsed in the repertoire that emerged from Israel\u2019s early 1950s apartheid-related diplomacy. Israel\u2019s original equivocal posture and praxis render the question of continuity or discontinuity in Israeli\u2013South African relations redundant. Both the late 1940s and the 1960s were characterised by use of the time-tested formula designed to facilitate shifts between conflicting positions.Having considered Israel\u2019s position on apartheid at the UN in terms of early multilateral encounter and equivocation, there remains the additional claim that apartheid presented an opportunity for Israel; that recourse to and negotiating an ideologically constructed Jewish identity helped to turn a geopolitical constraint into an instrument of emancipation. Here, sources already cited illustrate that Israel\u2019s envoys, when approaching apartheid, frequently referenced Jewish perspectives. They did more: they referenced a particular Jewish perspective\u2014their Zionist worldview, superimposing on the situation in South Africa the Zionist interpretation of Jewish history, its vocabulary, and its sense of Jewish identity. They read apartheid onideological terms.This was patent in the IOD \u2018compelling\u2019 moral argument requiring the Jewish state to take a stand in the face of Nazi-like legislation;[CITATION-162] or in Eliashiv\u2019s allusions to Israel\u2019s inability not to oppose racial discrimination as a matter of \u2018general principle\u2019, owing to \u2018our own history\u2019.[CITATION-163] Comay, we may recall, had read the plight of Natal Indians as a \u2018kind of \u201cAnti-Semitism\u201d\u2019, the way Zionism read the plight of Jews in Europe. He used the analogy, made and refuted, to establish the \u2018plane of civilisation\u2019 on which the Jewish state existed. Another ideological reading of apartheid through Jewish identity was triggered by his 1950 request to canvass the Union\u2019s attitude at the forthcoming Assembly.[CITATION-164] This caused Goitein, Israel\u2019s envoy to the Union, to meet Theophilus Ebenhaezer D\u00f6nges, the Union\u2019s intended Assembly representative.[CITATION-165] India, D\u00f6nges recounted, \u2018considered \u2026 Indians in this country \u2026 entitled to all the rights of the white nationals; the Union position was, however, that \u2018in addition to being Asiatics, they were unassimilable and \u2026 therefore could not be treated as the white population is treated\u2019.[CITATION-166] D\u00f6nges acknowledged that the underlying policy was the \u2018repatriation\u2019 of Indians to India. He brought up population transfers in Tyrol; Goitein retorted with the \u2018Turkey\u2013Greece exodus\u2019. Concluding a lengthy report on the conversation, Goitein offered his views. He, too, likened the position of the Indians in South Africa to that of Jewish communities. These were his terms, not D\u00f6nges\u2019; the analogy he made, however, may seem particularly peculiar:It will be realised that the idea of repatriation put forward by the Union Government is a form of Zionism. Here is a group of 700,000 Indians cut off from its homeland, it suffers \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 and the way to free itself from such \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 is to return to its homeland. What Iraq is to-day doing to its Iraqi Jews, the Union is prepared to do to its South African Indians.[CITATION-167] Comay could find in Jewish-like racial persecution of Indians of South Africa a mark of the level of civilisation of the Jewish state; Goitein, by contrast, was ready to apply to them the Zionist ideological imperative of return to the homeland.[CITATION-168] He thought South Africa\u2019s \u2018sounds a fair enough proposal\u2019, even if \u2018it does not appear practical\u2019 unless \u2018there were a recurrence ofsuch as the blacks made on the Indians in the beginning of 1949\u2019.[CITATION-169] He agreed, though, thatthe Indians are not assimilable. They are less likely to be assimilated than the Jews. Their religion is different, the colour of their skin is different. Their social life is different\u2014in short, Indians are not European.[CITATION-170] Goitien doubted that South Africa\u2019s race system could be sustained. \u2018In the long run\u2019, he prophesised, \u2018the whites will be beaten\u2019. But, for now, \u2018the white man intends holding the reins until the horse kicks and throws him\u2019. His conclusion was bleak:Israel should therefore appreciate the position as it is\u2014however objectionable\u2014and not set the Union against her by supporting Indians\u2019 claims to equality which the Union \u2026 will not grant \u2026 Unless we are prepared to antagonise the Union by backing up the demands of blacks and of coloureds to equal rights with the whites we cannot back up India in its claim that South African Indians should have the same rights. Nor are we called upon to do so.[CITATION-171] Comay found Goitein\u2019s comments \u2018most illuminating\u2019; he circulated them, praising their \u2018realistic approach\u2019.Why did Israel\u2019s envoys require such extensive recourse to Jewish identity to justify conflicting diplomatic praxis? And why did such recourse require an ideological interpretation of Israel\u2019s Jewish identity? Non-identification and non-alignment have been, as already noted, Israel\u2019s earliest foreign policy imperatives.[CITATION-172] As Comay observed: \u2018[a]t the birth of the state there were two godfathers\u2014the United States and the Soviet Union. To try to retain the support of both, we adopted a posture of non-identification, of keeping out of the Cold War.\u2019[CITATION-173] But not \u2018identifying too closely with one or the other bloc\u2019 \u2018of long-established powers versus states of more recent origins\u2019,[CITATION-174] could have been (and sometimes was) justified simply by reference to geostrategic concerns; equivocation, likewise, could have been (and was at times) justified by reference to concrete Israeli interests.Instead of interest-related justifications, Israel\u2019s envoys, while professing non-alignment, were intensely preoccupied with recording and pondering which \u2018bloc\u2019 they voted with or against.[CITATION-175] To align with or \u2018remain alone with the colonial bloc\u2019[CITATION-176] \u2014or, conversely, the \u2018anti-colonial bloc\u2019[CITATION-177] \u2014was a prospect that they both cherished and repudiated, a source of concern but also a mark of achievement.[CITATION-178] Later, one reminisced how Sharett considered Israel the \u2018original non-aligned nation\u2019.[CITATION-179] The universal vocation Eytan had read for the Jewish state caught in the Cold War contest was a prevalent sentiment.[CITATION-180] Such preoccupations underscore how recourse to the state\u2019s Jewish identity, read ideologically, offered the opportunity to navigate the dilemma presented by apartheid\u2014and, on a larger scale, the dilemma of Cold War orientation. Modernity had rendered Jewish identity elusive and indeterminate:[CITATION-181] neither quite European nor quite peripheral; neither really civilised nor really \u2018savage\u2019;[CITATION-182] in short, neither white nor black. Approaching apartheid through the prism of Jewish identity facilitated Israel\u2019s identification with any bloc and with no bloc. It allowed Israel to fit into, traverse, even straddle the civilisational categories still underpinning, if implicitly, the international society organised in the UN.[CITATION-183] Apartheid liberated Israel\u2019s envoys to claim (a tradition of) affinity to subjugated people and national liberation:[CITATION-184] Indians (and later, Africans) could be compared to Jews because, \u2018like them\u2019, Golda Meir reminisced, \u2018we had shaken off foreign rule\u2019.[CITATION-185] At the same time, it also allowed Israel\u2019s diplomats an association with Western, colonial powers,[CITATION-186] underpinning Comay\u2019s plea for a contextual understanding of the race situation in South Africa: it was like, yet unlike, the \u2018minority\u2019 situation of Jews in Europe.[CITATION-187] Belonging to no category spelled a freedom to belong, at will, need or convenience, to any. The Jewish state could be of East or West; developing though developed; ancient and new; subjugated yet civilised; black but white. In the Cold War setting, such flexibility had currency. This was the emancipatory power of apartheid for Israel: it freed Jews, and the Jewish state, to belong everywhere and nowhere;[CITATION-188] equivocating, through Jewish identity, on apartheid, was ever part of a larger, geopolitical, balancing act.For those who professed it, Israel\u2019s non-alignment was particularly Jewish; and yet, for its first envoys, Israel had a universal mission.[CITATION-189] Apartheid, viewed through the prism of Jewish identity and Zionist ideology, provided Israel\u2019s diplomats with an opportunity to solidify the transformation in the political status of the Jewish people and mark their now-sovereign world status\u2014to claim a place in \u2018world councils\u2019.[CITATION-190] Read through Jewish identity, apartheid did more; it rendered that equal place in the world\u2014despite regional isolation in the East and the need for constant balancing between the Cold War blocs\u2014into a world calling.The emancipatory power of elusive Jewish identity did not exhaust itself in early debates on apartheid. When the time came for Israel to develop bilateral African policies, it transmuted into a different, non-colonial,in Africa.[CITATION-191] This \u2018whiteburden\u2019 could look like, but claim distinction from, European colonialism precisely because Jewish identity both could and could not be compared to African identity.[CITATION-192] Asked if Africans who encountered Israelis in the 1960s displayed any misgivings about \u2018the fact that we [Israelis] were white\u2019, one of Israel\u2019s first envoys to Africa responded: \u2018well, you know, we were Jews. You know, something in-between\u2019. The Consul-General in Johannesburg told the Paramount Chief of Swaziland that Jews \u2018area white people\u2019.[CITATION-193] In January 1957, two months before Ghana\u2019s independence, David Ben-Gurion wrote to Kwame Nkrumah, invoking a common heritage of Jewish and black suffering. Like the people of Africa, his oft-quoted letter noted, \u2018Jews have suffered at the hands of the white peoples\u2019. The first five words of that sentence, however, are rarely quoted: \u2018, Jews have suffered at the hands of the white peoples\u2019.[CITATION-194] South African apartheid itself provided the means to harness an elusive Jewish identity to the ends of Israel\u2019s foreign policy. It was in South Africa, after all, that Jews were rendered \u2018white\u2019 by legislative fiat and administrative discretion.[CITATION-195] Receiving Goitein\u2019s report, Comay reacted against D\u00f6nges\u2019 remarks that \u2018the Asiatics were unassimiliable, and his suggestion \u2026 that they should be glad that the word, \u201cAsiatic\u201d was now dropped from the title of the Act\u2019. Sarcastically, he noted that this carried \u2018echoes of the debate over the Immigration Selection Act, where a similar handsome concession was made to the Jews: they were to be kept out of South Africa not as Jews, but as \u201cunassimilables\u201d.\u2019[CITATION-196] In Comay\u2019s own experience, both Jews and Indians were victims of a racialised construction of the body politic. Yet, at the same time, to now compare \u2018Jews\u2019 to \u2018Asiatics\u2019 gave offence to his civilisational sensibilities: this undermined the earlier achievement of Jewish whiteness in South Africa and, later, of Jewish sovereignty in Palestine. It was apartheid itself, then, that furnished the experience necessary to equivocate on apartheid. Prior to 1948, it had challenged Jewish whiteness and, therefore, Jewish political standing; after the establishment of Israel, apartheid, read through the prism of Zionist ideology, confirmed that Jews indeed belonged to a white, European \u2018plane of civilisation\u2019.Israel\u2019s encounter with apartheid had begun earlier, when its future envoys had first encountered race politics in South Africa. \u2018[W]hen the South African issues first became prominent\u2019 in the General Assembly in 1949, Comay recalled, \u2018no less than four senior members of the delegation\u2019 had been born in South Africa.[CITATION-197] Others encountered it on their travels to South Africa while serving the Zionist cause, or in Imperial uniform during the Second World War. Apartheid itself, carried over with the itineraries of Israel\u2019s early representatives, framed Israel\u2019s early diplomatic identity discourse. Comay\u2019s choice to describe apartheid as a \u2018caste system\u2019[CITATION-198] was not original: it was borrowed from Jan Smuts, prime minister of South Africa, who in 1946 countered India\u2019s original complaint with an allegation of hypocrisy given its own caste system. \u2018Is there a country in the wide world,\u2019 Smuts asked, \u2018where there is more social discrimination between communities and classes than in India\u2019?[CITATION-199] Nor was it Comay\u2019s first use of the phrase: in a 1947 speech on the impending South African elections, Comay described India\u2019s UN actions as an \u2018attack from the outside\u2019 on the \u2018South African caste system\u2019.[CITATION-200] Comay\u2019s South African background played out equally in the invocation of affinities for both\u2014or, rather, all three\u2014sides of the race conflict: the position of African,[CITATION-201] Indian[CITATION-202] and Afrikaner[CITATION-203] could all be alluded to by reference to Jewish experience. Such invocations could, and did, elicit opposing identifications and direct opposing policy prescriptions. Comay\u2019s 1947 South African speech elaborated on Smut\u2019s \u2018double defeat\u2019 at the UN. Noting how the National Party was shedding its more pro-Nazi elements in pursuit of legitimacy and popularity, he asserted that many Afrikaners, rather than professing an anti-Semitic sentiment, had a \u2018certain fellow-feeling for another little people struggling with the same Imperial Power [that had suppressed their own independence]\u2019.[CITATION-204] Yet in the same speech, still speaking of Smuts\u2019 UN defeat, he reminded his audience that it was in the cause of Natal Indians and \u2018as their champion that a young lawyer called Gandhi first worked up his passive resistance ideas\u2019.[CITATION-205] Jewish identity, read against and through apartheid, was strikingly malleable.Indeed, it was in South Africa that Comay himself, as a young lawyer, had his own Gandhi-esquemoment: in November 1934, theof South Africa reported a \u2018demonstration by the Jews in Capetown against the Nazis there\u2019:A public demonstration against the nature of the propaganda published by the Grey Shirts was made in Capetown \u2026 when three prominent Capetown citizens, Adv. M.S. Comay, Dr. J.L. Gordon and Councillor A.Z. Berman, destroyed, in the presence of a policeman an offensive Grey Shirt poster.The poster was carried by a newsboy selling the Grey Shirt organ \u2018The Truth\u2019, and contained the words: \u2018Ka#rs and Jews indecently assault white girls.\u2019 The three men called upon the policeman to stand by and then took the offending poster and copies of the newspaper from the newsboy and tore both poster and paper to pieces. They then gave the policeman their names and addresses and expressed a wish to be prosecuted as a protest against the offensive nature of the poster.[CITATION-206] Resistance was but one form of culture to travel from South Africa. Goitein\u2019s observations\u2014which Comay found \u2018most illuminating\u2019\u2014on Indian unassimilability attested to another. Goitein agreed with D\u00f6nges that \u2018the Indians are not assimilable\u2019 owing to their different \u2018religion \u2026 colour of ... skin \u2026 [and] social life\u2019, all of which rendered them, he determined, \u2018not European\u2019[CITATION-207] (and, pointedly, less European than Jews). This discourse was not only deeply rooted in South African Jewish experience; it also echoed, in fact, Greyshirt anti-Jewish propaganda of the 1930s. One such poster read thus: \u2018Jews \u2026 are Asiatics \u2026 they never will be otherwise. Their ideas do not conform to ours, and will not even though they live among us for ten generations. A leopard cannot change its spots. Jews are Asiatics\u2019.[CITATION-208] In the final analysis, Israel\u2019s early equivocation on apartheid\u2014its resistance to and its silence on apartheid\u2014was rooted in the very elusiveness of Jewish identity and its iterations in South Africa. The elasticity it provided both signified what Comay and his colleagues considered to be the deficient cultural, racial and political status of pre-state Jewish existence (and the lingering deficiency of South Africa Jews who, unlike Comay or Goitein, did not practise Zionism) and marked the cultural, racial and political transformation embodied by the establishment of a sovereign Jewish state.In this article, I have outlined an earlier history of, and thus longer perspective on, Israel\u2019s encounter with Africa and position on South African apartheid than one which begins closer to the 1960s. I have also sought to illustrate the constitutive role that Israel\u2019s Jewish, malleable and elastic identity, read through the articles of Zionist faith, had played in Israel\u2019s equivocation on South African apartheid. These \u2018ideational\u2019 or cultural constructs did not compete with or stand in contradistinction to; rather, they helped Israel\u2019s early diplomats to frame and organise, negotiate and manage, and ultimately act on and give effect to, the conflicting interests that compelled, in their turn, the invocation of such cultural framework of reference.These findings have broader implications. The convergence of identity and interest in framing Israel\u2019s equivocation on apartheid and colonial questions underscores the fact that Israel\u2019s orientation dilemma was not limited to an East\u2013West axis but extended also along North\u2013South lines. If this recasts the geography of Israel\u2019s orientation dilemma, it also compels a reappraisal of its structure and pathology. In particular, it compels a reassessment of Israel\u2019s diplomatic neutrality in the early\u2014and even the later\u2014stages of the Cold War.In the fourth section, I traced the pre-independence provenance of that interpretative framework in Jewish experience in pre-apartheid, yet nonetheless racially-managed, South Africa. This, too, provides insight. It was Jewish otherness that allowed Israel to obey and avoid the Cold War alignment pressures by invoking a universal mission rooted in the particular Jewish experience; but it was apartheid that allowed its envoys, sovereign Jews, to constantly, if subtly, change roles\u2014now \u2018others within\u2019, now \u2018others without\u2019[CITATION-209] \u2014depending on audience and circumstance. In pre-1948 South Africa, Jewish otherness met its colonial analogues in the form of Indian minority and African majority; but in apartheid South Africa, after 1948, Jewish otherness could be overcome, too. Aamir Mufti\u2019sconsiders the \u2018Jewish Question\u2019 in Europe as an archetype of (post-)colonial minority, \u2018an early, and exemplary, instance of the crisis of minority\u2019.[CITATION-210] The case of South African apartheid, and the way Israel\u2019s early representatives negotiated it, suggests, however, that whether to generate analogies or to refute them, forge or break bonds of solidarity and identification, Jewish minority (and majority) experience and colonial experience reflect one another, again and again. Comay\u2019s revulsion from and understanding of Afrikaner nationalism, his rebuke of India and celebration of Gandhi provides a case in point. Otherness is a hall of mirrors reproducing, endlessly, each other\u2019s image.",
