    "article": "This article examines Ulster Unionist political thought, in its widest sense, against the backdrop of the Northern Ireland Troubles. During this period, Ulster Unionists sought to resist nationalist and republican arguments for the unification of Ireland and to articulate their position to supporters and wider audiences. As Direct Rule from London followed the suspension of the unionist-dominated Northern Ireland parliament at Stormont in 1972 and its abolition the following year, internal unionist debate intensified over the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. Defining Ulster Unionism broadly, at a time when its organisational forms were proliferating, the article considers the Ulster Unionist Party and its offshoot Vanguard, as well as the Democratic Unionist Party and the paramilitary organisations, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association, and their affiliated political bodies. The article analyses, in turn, the four competing unionist visions of the future: a return to majority-rule devolution; independence; closer integration with Great Britain; and power-sharing devolution. Not attempting a detailed consideration of the policy proposals, the article instead explores the connections forged between Ulster Unionist political ideas, some of them of long pedigree, and wider debates. It shows that, at a time of considerable change for the United Kingdom, Ulster Unionist argument reflected\u2014much more than is currently understood, and sometimes in a pronounced form\u2014a wide range of interconnected contemporary British disputes. These not only concerned the constitution, nationality and sovereignty, but also permissiveness, political parties, decline, the end of empire, Thatcherism and European integration.It is easy to dismiss the study of Ulster Unionist political thought. There is, without doubt, a \u2018resilient popular image of unionism as essentially anti- or non-intellectual\u2019.[CITATION-1] It is also difficult to identify any \u2018great thinkers\u2019 or noted texts. Yet a different picture emerges if a wider definition of political thought is employed\u2014one that analyses the intellectual arguments made in certain political contexts.[CITATION-2] During the bloody conflict known as the Troubles that ran from the late 1960s to the late 1990s, Ulster Unionists were under considerable pressure not just to resist nationalist and republican arguments for the unification of Ireland but also to articulate their own position, especially to their own supporters as well as increasingly to wider audiences. In these circumstances, internal Ulster Unionist political argument intensified over the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. As Direct Rule from London was introduced following the suspension of the unionist-dominated Northern Ireland parliament at Stormont in 1972 and its abolition the following year, Ulster Unionists called variously for a return to majority-rule devolution, some degree of independence, closer integration with Great Britain, or devolution with some provision for power sharing. While these basic positions are familiar, the ways in which Ulster Unionists argued for them\u2014drawing, in some cases, on established unionist ideas but also setting them against a surprisingly wide range of contemporary British debates\u2014remain obscure.The intellectual history of Northern Irish politics has, until relatively recently, received little attention. Partly, this is because the history of political thought has been slow to develop as far as the study of Ireland is concerned.[CITATION-3] It is also because interpretations of the causes of the Troubles, which have been the central preoccupation in studies of recent Northern Irish history, have pointed in different directions. A powerful and enduring explanation has labelled the Troubles a \u2018religious conflict\u2019, with the sociologist Steve Bruce\u2014who studied Ian Paisley and the wider influence of his Protestant evangelical views\u2014providing arguably the most explicit statement of this perspective in the mid-1980s.[CITATION-4] Bruce argued that Ulster Protestants were an \u2018ethnic group\u2019, and by the 1990s it had become commonplace to characterise the whole dispute as an \u2018ethnic war\u2019 between culturally defined and self-consciously differentiated communities.[CITATION-5] Richard Bourke was, therefore, going against the grain of much writing on the Troubles when, in 2003, he emphasised the importance of ideas and argued that in Northern Ireland \u2018the prime issue in contention was the core value of democracy\u2019, linked to interpretations of self-determination.[CITATION-6] In this analysis, the Ulster Unionist emphasis on the constitutional wishes of the majority in Northern Ireland was consistently pitted against the primacy given by nationalists to the preferences of a majority in Ireland as a whole.[CITATION-7] Despite this, it is still the case, as Colin W. Reid put it in 2017, that there has been \u2018little work on unionist political ideas\u2019.[CITATION-8] The omission is particularly striking for the later part of the twentieth century. As internal debate within unionism escalated, its organisational forms proliferated. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which had controlled the Northern Ireland government between 1921 and 1972, continued to be the largest unionist party, but it now visibly fractured. The Vanguard Movement, flirting with independence, emerged as a pressure group within the UUP in 1972 and broke away to form the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party the following year. In the 1980s, factional groups within the UUP supporting devolution or integration assumed institutional identities, most notably the Campaign for Equal Citizenship endorsing electoral integration\u2014that is, British political party organisation in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, Paisley\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), formed in 1971, consistently challenged the UUP as it tried to position itself as the most strongly pro-majority-rule devolution party. Paramilitary organisations, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), formed in 1966 and 1971 respectively, also entered the debates over independence and power sharing, sometimes through affiliated political groups. Besides disagreeing among themselves, unionists also faced evolving challenges from Irish Nationalists. The constitutional nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had been established in 1970, and in the early 1980s Sinn F\u00e9in, the political wing of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), entered electoral politics in the aftermath of the hunger strikes of 1980 and 1981. All the while, unionists were under pressure from successive British governments, Conservative and Labour alike, to agree to the re-establishment of devolution on a power-sharing basis and to accept the involvement of the Republic of Ireland in resolving the conflict.[CITATION-9] This was, in broad terms, the basis of the short-lived 1973 Sunningdale Agreement, with the Republic\u2019s consultative role institutionalised in the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement and the more enduring 1998 Good Friday Agreement. At the same time, it is important to appreciate the intractability of the conflict for much of the period.[CITATION-10] Some of the characteristics of Ulster Unionism have been valuably illuminated in literature that sets the background for this article. Ulster Unionism evolved from Irish Unionism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, stressing a commitment to the British Empire and the economic benefits of the 1800 Act of Union.[CITATION-11] During debates over Irish Home Rule, which reached a climax between 1912 and 1914, a distinct \u2018Ulster identity\u2019 developed, involving a celebration of the seventeenth-century Plantation and linking \u2018Protestant Ulster\u2019 to some extent with Presbyterianism.[CITATION-12] Although Ulster Unionism had emerged in order to resist Home Rule, after the creation of Northern Ireland in 1921 it became deeply committed to the maintenance of the Stormont parliament.[CITATION-13] Ulster Unionism was attached to the monarchy and celebrated a commitment to civil and religious liberty, dating back to the 1688 Glorious Revolution, whose protection was the declared mission of the Orange Order, the fraternal Protestant organisation.[CITATION-14] Ulster Unionism has been defined by David W. Miller as demonstrating a conditional (sometimes called contractarian) loyalty to Britain, although it is clear that this applies to Scottish Unionism as well.[CITATION-15] In the mid-1980s the political scientist Jennifer Todd delineated a distinction between Ulster loyalist and British unionist perspectives which, while valuable, has been criticised for not fully appreciating the overlapping identities and divisions within the categories.[CITATION-16] In a widely read overview, J.J. Lee castigated Ulster Unionism for its \u2018supremacist\u2019 outlook in the years before 1972, but it is now recognised that fear, isolation and vulnerability characterised Ulster Unionism in the later twentieth century.[CITATION-17] This article considers Ulster Unionism broadly, examining the positions adopted by the political parties and the paramilitaries. Its source base is drawn from the extensive pamphlet literature in which unionists set out their arguments, held in the Northern Ireland Political Collection at the Linen Hall Library in Belfast as well as political speeches and party material held at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland. These have been supplemented by material from the UK and Irish National Archives and from some private papers. The article itself is divided into four thematic sections, each moving chronologically and examining the competing unionist visions of Northern Ireland\u2019s future: majority-rule devolution, independence, integration, and power-sharing devolution. It does not attempt a detailed consideration of the policy proposals. Instead, against the backdrop of the Troubles, the article explores connections forged between Ulster Unionist political ideas and wider debates.Twenty-five years ago, Ian McBride argued that Ulster Unionism\u2014often seen as \u2018irrational, backward and deviant\u2019\u2014actually \u2018reveals, in heightened form, problematic questions about nationality and sovereignty which are rooted in the structure of the United Kingdom itself\u2019.[CITATION-18] McBride was writing in a context where, with Linda Colley making a central contribution, discussion of the erosion of \u2018Britishness\u2019 was rife in academic circles (despite at the same time gaining increased prominence in contemporary public life).[CITATION-19] While McBride\u2019s argument was perceptive, it has remained untested by a detailed examination of Ulster Unionist political argument. Such an examination shows that the scope of unionist political thinking was wider than nationality and sovereignty\u2014though these themes emerged in some under-appreciated ways. In attempting to secure endorsement for various constitutional proposals, Ulster Unionist thought also reflected other key anxieties facing the UK in the later twentieth century in social, economic, political and international terms, including interlinked arguments over permissiveness, political parties, decline, the end of empire, Thatcherism and European integration.Until 1972, Ulster Unionism as a whole was \u2018characterised by its commitment to the existing provisions for majority rule\u2019 in Northern Ireland, with the party possessing a majority able to form a government and seats contested on a first-past-the-post constituency basis as they were at Westminster.[CITATION-20] Brian Faulkner, the Northern Ireland prime minister in 1971\u20132, argued that \u2018the meaning, however hard, of democracy\u2019 was that \u2018the will of the majority must decide fundamental issues\u2019.[CITATION-21] This was also the view of those unionists, such as Ian Paisley, the founder of the Free Presbyterian Church, who criticised the Northern Ireland government for being too willing to bow to pressure for reform from London.[CITATION-22] Significantly, this was a time when the existing understanding (which the devolved administration at Stormont had complicated since the 1920s) that the UK was a unitary state, with all power flowing from the centre, was coming under scrutiny.[CITATION-23] In this context, Ulster Unionists had given some thought as to why devolution remained desirable\u2014assuming that it would continue to be majority rule. Giving evidence to the Royal Commission on the Constitution, set up to examine the structure of the UK amid the rise of Scottish and Welsh nationalism, the Ulster Unionist Council (UUC), the UUP\u2019s governing body, emphasised the provincial parliament\u2019s ability \u2018to reflect in legislation the particular moral opinions of the people of the region\u2019 on issues such as divorce and abortion.[CITATION-24] This related to discussions about extending the 1967 Abortion Act to Northern Ireland and responses to the 1969 Divorce Reform Act, which had made divorces easier to obtain in England and Wales. These were legislative expressions of the broader trend of permissiveness, which was particularly associated with youth and concerned the loosening of long-standing sexual and moral restraints. It is tempting to see the Ulster Unionist opposition to these changes as reflecting a conservative Protestant viewpoint, but, in recent years, historians have emphasised that conservative attitudes persisted to a significant extent across the UK.[CITATION-25] After the suspension of Stormont, these views continued to underpin the UUP position as it called for a return to majority-rule devolution\u2014albeit now backed by a multi-party committee system.[CITATION-26] Advocacy of majority-rule devolution soon passed to the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC). This was an electoral coalition\u2014endorsed by the Orange Order and comprising the UUP (calling itself the Official Unionist Party), the DUP and the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party\u2014set up in early 1974 to channel unionist opposition to the Sunningdale Agreement that envisaged a power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive and a cross-border Council of Ireland. The UUUC was thus pitted against the pro-agreement parties making up the Executive: those unionists supporting Faulkner (who had been forced to resign as UUP leader), the SDLP and the cross-community Alliance Party. With the Royal Commission on the Constitution (chaired by Lord Kilbrandon in its later stages) having reported in autumn 1973 and recommended devolution for Scotland and Wales on the basis of majority rule, the UUUC argued for a Northern Ireland settlement along the same lines.[CITATION-27] Despite taking evidence from Northern Ireland while Stormont was still in operation, the Commission had refrained from offering any recommendations for its system of government\u2014amid a volatile situation and under British government pressure not to jeopardise the movement towards power sharing.[CITATION-28] In April 1974, the UUUC committed itself to support for devolution in Northern Ireland within a future federal UK.[CITATION-29] Federalism technically involved dividing, not devolving, power between Westminster and regional governments, but the UUUC was not alone in defining it loosely as a type of devolution.[CITATION-30] Events now moved quickly, with the Ulster Workers\u2019 Council (UWC) strike in May 1974, with UUUC support, bringing down the Executive and then preparations beginning for the ill-fated 1975 Constitutional Convention. The situation was a complex one. The strikers argued that it was not power sharing they opposed but the involvement of Dublin.[CITATION-31] Nevertheless, as the Convention approached, the UUUC once again called for \u2018a system of government broadly in line with the provisions to be made for constitutional devolution in the United Kingdom as a whole\u2019.[CITATION-32] At the same time, the ways in which the UUUC made its case developed significantly. In 1974 it had argued frankly that \u2018no Political Party at Westminster wishes to stand in the way of the unification of Ireland let alone positively seek to maintain the union between Ulster and the rest of the UK\u2019.[CITATION-33] Since the 1920s, the UUP MPs had taken the Conservative whip at Westminster in return for administrative, electoral and financial help. The relationship had weakened considerably by the 1960s, but there was still unionist dismay at the Conservative government\u2019s decision to suspend Stormont and impose Direct Rule \u2018without taking its party colleagues in Northern Ireland into confidence and consultation\u2019.[CITATION-34] Increasingly, the UUUC argued that party interests dominated the actions of Westminster politicians. As the UUP leader Harry West made clear in 1976, this related particularly to the view that Labour, and its leader Harold Wilson, made sympathetic noises about a united Ireland because of its electoral value in certain British constituencies with high concentrations of people from the Republic of Ireland (who were given the right to vote and otherwise treated as British citizens).[CITATION-35] The Labour-leaning inclinations of Irish Catholic voters in Britain were readily apparent.[CITATION-36] Yet the argument was wider than this. In one sense, it was built on Irish Protestant fears, dating back to the early modern period, of English treachery, which had become pronounced during the debates over Home Rule as their dependence on Britain was made evident.[CITATION-37] The argument also chimed with a growing public and media dissatisfaction with the British political system and its institutions, especially political parties, characterised by scepticism about politicians\u2019 motives, which had begun to develop in the 1950s and gathered pace in the 1970s and 1980s.[CITATION-38] Calls for majority-rule devolution not only included accusations that a \u2018low standard of integrity prevailed in public life\u2019 at Westminster but were also sometimes accompanied by a condemnation of Direct Rule as \u2018colonial\u2019\u2014as in the case of the UUP politician Austin Ardill.[CITATION-39] The term colonial was used to mean undemocratic control over Northern Ireland by Britain and did not carry the connotations of colonisation, involving the displacement and subordination of earlier inhabitants. Yet, in suggesting that the colonial experience was a negative one, its use was arguably a particular expression of British unease at coming to terms with the imperial past.[CITATION-40] It was especially striking not only because Ulster Unionists had earlier embraced an imperial identity but also because criticisms of British rule as colonial had previously been advanced from nationalist and republican perspectives. Nationalists and republicans often viewed northern Protestants as a settler-colonial group\u2014an interpretation with some merit until the nineteenth century but of less value for the more recent period. At the time of the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, Irish Nationalists had reiterated the established argument that Ireland was not a colony but instead a nation because of the assumption that colonies would become self-governing dominions rather than fully independent states. But by the 1970s, with widespread European decolonisation, the term colonial was used to imply illegitimacy and to suggest that thewould not last.[CITATION-41] This shift in interpretation was also intertwined with internal debates within the republican movement after 1969. While the Official IRA emphasised class struggle, the Provisionals criticised the \u2018colonial\u2019 nature of Northern Ireland where, as they saw it, the main problem was a duplicitous Britain whose \u2018imperial\u2019 political and economic interests benefited from the existing arrangements.[CITATION-42] After the collapse of the UUUC in 1977, with devolution in Scotland and Wales rejected by referenda in 1979 and the UUP divided between integrationist and devolutionist wings, the DUP continued to call for majority-rule devolution, linked to a charge against permissiveness. Paisley had recently launched his \u2018Save Ulster from Sodomy\u2019 campaign to prevent the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (which had been done in England and Wales in 1967) on the basis that the Bible condemned homosexuality as a sin. Calling for an end to the \u2018colonial type system of \u201cDirect Rule\u201d\u2019, the DUP\u2019s 1979 General Election manifesto now proclaimed its \u2018strong stand in accordance with Christian principles on the great moral issues of our day\u2019.[CITATION-43] The DUP was not alone in making these arguments, with, for example, the UUP MP for South Belfast, Robert Bradford, also doing so.[CITATION-44] But the DUP was the prominent voice\u2014and this continued to be the case when the Thatcher government was in power. The DUP manifesto for the 1982 Assembly Election, an attempt by the British government to restart devolution, railed against \u2018the imposition by Westminster of alien moral standards upon Ulster\u2019 and asserted that \u2018Ulster should decide its own moral standards and codes of behaviour\u2019.[CITATION-45] In the event, male homosexuality in adults over 21 was legalised in Northern Ireland in 1982, following a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights. Even so, it should be recognised that the DUP\u2019s position was not that far from the manner in which, during the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher and some of those around her had\u2014from a Christian perspective\u2014identified themselves with existing discontent about aspects of the permissive society.[CITATION-46] Yet, at the same time, the DUP was sharply critical of other parts of Thatcher\u2019s domestic agenda. Leaning to the left on socio-economic issues since its formation, the DUP was in the tradition of independent unionists who, since the inter-war period, had been critical of both Stormont and Westminster for not doing enough to reduce unemployment.[CITATION-47] Now, in 1982, as the Thatcher government prioritised low inflation from a monetarist perspective, Paisley lamented the fact that UK unemployment was \u2018soaring\u2019 to 3 million, adding that the \u2018Government\u2019s running down of our hospitals must be halted\u2019.[CITATION-48] At the DUP conference in 1984 Paisley criticised the government\u2019s \u2018unprecedented attack upon the foundations of the welfare state\u2019 and its decision to increase expenditure taxes that worked to \u2018take from the mouth of labour the bread it has so strenuously earned\u2019.[CITATION-49] Despite its rhetorical attack on the welfare state, in practice the Thatcher government largely left it intact and actually emphasised its commitment to the NHS.[CITATION-50] The Thatcher government had, however, reduced income tax, especially at the higher levels, and had increased the rate of VAT. The points about welfare were powerful ones to make because, in the years after 1945, the Ulster Unionist government in Northern Ireland had been ready to identify the Union with the \u2018full benefits of the welfare state\u2019.[CITATION-51] Indeed, within the UUP there was some acknowledgement of the DUP positioning and its potential electoral appeal.[CITATION-52] This was especially striking as the most forthright calls from the UUP for majority-rule devolution at this time came from Edgar Graham, a law academic at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, who\u2014in stark contrast to the DUP\u2014struck a Thatcherite chord himself, calling for economic policies designed to foster \u2018the business and entrepreneurial spirit of its people\u2019.[CITATION-53] The DUP continued to dominate calls for majority-rule devolution in the years ahead, but there was a substantial change in the arguments underpinning its position as the party responded to the end of the Cold War and especially to the debate over increased European integration. In 1993, the DUP asserted the \u2018right of the Ulster people to self-determination\u2019, including \u2018by means of a referendum\u2019.[CITATION-54] The Charter Group, which had emerged within the UUP after the Anglo-Irish Agreement and which called for majority-rule devolution, had similarly argued in 1987 that the \u2018Unionist case for self-determination is a just one\u2019.[CITATION-55] Yet in recent years the resort to self-determination had not been a core part of the case for majority-rule devolution. At the start of the twentieth century, both Ulster Unionists and Irish Nationalists had committed themselves to competing interpretations of self-determination, which rose to particular prominence during the First World War under the influence of the US President Woodrow Wilson. In the unionist case, the original importance attributed to the self-determination of the UK as a whole was soon replaced by an emphasis on the wishes of a majority in Ulster. By the start of the Troubles, amid widespread decolonisation, the prevailing international interpretation of self-determination related to peoples inhabiting a pre-existing territory, and this was usually taken to mean the island of Ireland. However, in the 1990s, the break-up of both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia challenged this assumption.[CITATION-56] In this context, the call for self-determination was linked to opposition to British membership of the European Community on the basis that it challenged British sovereignty. The argument about sovereignty had a substantial lineage, stretching back to the early 1960s and the UK\u2019s first application for membership, and coming from those, mainly in the Conservative Party but also from the Labour Party, concerned with the threat to Westminster\u2019s parliamentary sovereignty from European political union.[CITATION-57] From 1969, Enoch Powell, the Conservative and Ulster Unionist politician, had been the best-known proponent of this view.[CITATION-58] But it remained relatively marginal until the late 1980s, when Thatcher began to argue against the creation of a \u2018European super-state\u2019, stimulating concerns about sovereignty in a growing body of \u2018Eurosceptic\u2019 opinion in the Conservative Party and in the pressure group the Anti-Federalist League, which later became the UK Independence Party (UKIP).[CITATION-59] The DUP itself had a pedigree on the argument about sovereignty. It had articulated such concerns during the 1975 referendum on European Community membership, but these were, to some extent, obscured by the virulence of Paisley\u2019s criticism of the Community as a Catholic force and a correspondingly potent threat to Protestantism.[CITATION-60] In its 1979 General Election manifesto, the DUP warned against \u2018the extension of its [the European Community\u2019s] powers at the expense of our national sovereignty\u2019.[CITATION-61] Like others, the DUP saw a particular danger arising from the Maastricht Treaty for increased political and monetary union, which was negotiated in 1991 and enacted in 1993 with the formation of the EU. The party endorsed the growing call for a referendum on the treaty on the basis of the UK\u2019s \u2018right of self-determination\u2019, and subsequently linked this to its commitment to self-determination for Northern Ireland. Put together, these offered a means of preventing the \u2018double degradation of submission to Dublin rule \u2026 and to the thumbscrew of the EU\u2019.[CITATION-62] From a British government perspective, Northern Ireland independence and British withdrawal was, as the then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, put it in 1974, \u2018unmentionable\u2019.[CITATION-63] In Ulster Unionist politics, independence was advanced out of the fractious politics of the UUP, with William Craig playing the prominent role but with a degree of ambiguity over whether he wanted independence or a type of federation.[CITATION-64] As a Stormont minister in the mid- and late 1960s, his calls for federation were not that far from what Terence O\u2019Neill, as Northern Ireland prime minister, sometimes advocated. But Craig\u2019s support for Ian Smith\u2019s White-dominated government in Rhodesia\u2014which made a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965 as the UK refused to move it to independence without majority, that is, Black, rule\u2014was more provocative, and was indeed a glimpse of the settler-colonial perspective. In the event, O\u2019Neill dismissed Craig as Minister of Home Affairs in late 1968 because of, among other things, his \u2018attraction to ideas of a UDI nature\u2019.[CITATION-65] In February 1971, writing in the prominent Belfast current affairs magazine, Craig renewed his call for a \u2018British Federation\u2019 that would include the Republic of Ireland. In one sense this looked back to the nineteenth century, when ideas of federalism for the whole UK had attracted support from both nationalist and unionist politicians as a means of resisting the centralisation of political power at Westminster, only to fade after 1880 as debates over Home Rule focused increasingly on Ireland.[CITATION-66] But Craig\u2019s case for \u2018constitutional changes\u2019 also related to current debates over Scotland and Wales. He argued that \u2018the inadequacy of the National Parliament at Westminster and the growing discontent throughout the Kingdom\u2019 could be alleviated by the more effective democracy of \u2018regional Parliaments\u2019. Crucially, Craig contended that the \u2018discontent \u2026 will soon identify itself with the growing sense of Britain\u2019s failure internationally\u2019.[CITATION-67] He thus set his argument within the pervasive and wide-ranging debate about British \u2018decline\u2019. From the late 1950s, calls from the Left to tackle economic decline (relative in fact) through economic planning had attracted substantial attention.[CITATION-68] The argument subsequently broadened out, with the Conservative right-wing pressure group the Monday Club, which Craig later joined, making a distinctive contribution. Established in 1961 to resist the decolonisation that it saw as engendering Britain\u2019s international decline, the club also strongly identified with the Rhodesian UDI\u2014although, so far as the UK was concerned, it sought to maintain the territorial integrity of the state, with some of its members later supporting integration for Northern Ireland.[CITATION-69] From February 1972, advocacy of greater independence for Ulster was intertwined with the emergence of Craig\u2019s Vanguard Movement. Set up just before the suspension of Stormont, Vanguard\u2019s constitution spoke of bolstering \u2018the Parliament of Northern Ireland\u2019, but Craig soon went further, arguing that he favoured \u2018some form of friendly Dominion status under the Crown\u2019 if remaining in the UK proved impossible.[CITATION-70] The term \u2018Dominion\u2019 had signified semi-independence within the British Empire, being widely used until the end of the Second World War to denote Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Irish Free State. The use of the term diminished thereafter amid the emergence of the British Commonwealth as an association of free and equal former members of the Empire, with the British monarch as its symbolic head. Yet in Northern Ireland, the Stormont MP W.F. McCoy emerged as a powerful advocate of dominion status in the years after 1945, making loud calls for greater fiscal independence.[CITATION-71] Now, in the 1970s, it was Kennedy Lindsay who did the most to advance the case for independence in the form of dominion status. Born in Canada but brought up in Northern Ireland, Lindsay was a historian who had most recently been associated with London University\u2019s Institute of Commonwealth Studies. In April 1972, he had first come into contact with Craig, who asked him to write a Vanguard pamphlet concerned with the economics of dominion status.[CITATION-72] In, Lindsay set his arguments in the context of the development of the Commonwealth, but academic assessments of his assertion of the economic viability of an independent Ulster have been understandably critical.[CITATION-73] Lindsay recognised that redistributed resources from Westminster were \u2018substantial sums\u2019, but insisted that several \u2018small countries, with resources no greater than Ulster, are surviving comfortably without financial subventions\u2019.[CITATION-74] Lindsay did not, moreover, say anything about the level of welfare\u2014mirroring earlier calls for dominion status that had been silent on the issue.What was arguably more significant, however, was Lindsay\u2019s opposition to an independent Ulster being in the European Community. Before moving back to Northern Ireland, Lindsay had lived in England and been a member of the British Labour Party, applying to be a parliamentary candidate in 1970 and identifying opposition to UK membership of the European Community as one of his central beliefs, on the basis that it \u2018would be disastrous for Britain both in the short and the long term\u2019.[CITATION-75] At this point, Labour was more divided over the issue than the Conservatives who\u2014in government since 1970\u2014had negotiated UK entry into the Community, which was set to take place at the start of 1973. Now, citing the work of the Labour-supporting Cambridge University economist Nicholas Kaldor, Lindsay argued that membership would entail a higher cost of living and production\u2014arguments that became increasingly prevalent in Labour circles.[CITATION-76] Lindsay\u2019s opposition to Community membership had an influence on Craig, who asked him to take a leading role in the research and publicity for Vanguard. Having previously held that membership of the European Community was \u2018not really a consideration\u2019, Craig now contended that Northern Ireland should assert its right to self-determination to claim independence in order to benefit from increased trade with the Commonwealth, making it explicit that this involved being \u2018[o]utside the Common Market\u2019.[CITATION-77] Craig did not substantiate his point about the European Community, shared by some in the Monday Club, but it did represent a significant challenge to the prevalent view that Community membership was necessary to take advantage of shifts in the UK\u2019s trade away from the Commonwealth and towards Western Europe.The following year, Craig made an argument about allegiance\u2014arguably the central question in unionist thought. He suggested that an independent dominion would be held together by \u2018allegiance to Ulster with its own distinctive heritage and way of life\u2019. Craig did not go into further detail and kept his language vague, but his rationale was that \u2018We cannot think of owing any allegiance to an Irish Republic no matter how it is restructured. Others can\u2019t think of owing loyalty to Britain\u2019. Craig did, admittedly, see the dominion as \u2018resting on its British Heritage\u2019, but he stressed that he sought to overcome religious divides, creating \u2018an Ulster where a man\u2019s religion is only his own and God\u2019s concern\u2019, and called on \u2018Ulster Protestants and Ulster Roman Catholics\u2019 to recognise how much they had \u2018in common with each other\u2019. Craig\u2019s speech was notable for his tentative willingness to consider temporary power sharing\u2014amid short-lived discussions between Craig and the SDLP\u2014but it also generated a backlash from Faulkner, who argued that Ulster independence was \u2018absolutely contrary\u2019 to unionism, prompting Craig to leave the UUP and form the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party[CITATION-78] Craig\u2019s arguments had academic antecedents. In 1971, the social scientist Richard Rose had argued that \u2018Protestants and Catholics within the province might feel more of a community of interest with each other \u2026 than with their neighbours\u2019 in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland.[CITATION-79] Furthermore, the basic premise of Craig\u2019s argument had already been tried out in political debate. In 1972, Fergus McAteer, who had been involved in the civil rights movement and was the son of the Nationalist Party leader Eddie McAteer, argued that it was possible to find \u2018common ground\u2019 between nationalists and unionists through their commitment to Ulster.[CITATION-80] Yet in practice Vanguard did not pursue the implications\u2014including the question of whether Ulster was a nation. The pamphletdid not actually make the claim stated in its title.[CITATION-81] At one level, it is difficult to disagree with the sociologist Sarah Nelson\u2019s assessment that Vanguard lacked \u2018a clear picture of that Ulster identity that would underpin independence\u2019, but at the same time it is necessary to appreciate that national identities have often been formed by a sense of the other.[CITATION-82] Moreover, the question of whether Ulster Unionism was itself a form of nationalism continues to preoccupy historians.[CITATION-83] From 1974, the politics of the UUUC pushed the idea of federation\u2014as opposed to independence\u2014to the forefront among those associated with Vanguard. David Trimble, then a law lecturer at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and chair of the North Down Vanguard Association, announced his support for a \u2018Community of the British Isles\u2019 as a \u2018loose federation\u2019.[CITATION-84] Lindsay was also prominent here\u2014and indeed he had, from late 1972, wanted to establish \u2018more formal contacts\u2019 with Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party so that they could \u2018reinforce one another in the struggle to reduce exploitation of the regions of the United Kingdom by London and the South-East\u2019.[CITATION-85] Lindsay\u2019s point resonated because Scottish Nationalists were beginning to argue for independence from a left-wing perspective that was opposed to control from London and the forces of market capitalism.[CITATION-86] Plaid Cymru also embraced the economic ideas of the Left.[CITATION-87] Yet it was Lindsay\u2019s own publicthat was most apparent when, in early 1974, he stated: \u2018I look forward to a federal United Kingdom with subordinate parliaments in England, Scotland, Wales and Ulster\u2019.[CITATION-88] With Craig marginalised in unionist circles after supporting \u2018voluntary\u2019 power sharing with the SDLP in the summer of 1975, and Lindsay continuing to vacillate between support for independence and for federation, the momentum behind the independence debate moved elsewhere.[CITATION-89] Under the influence of Glenn Barr, the Vanguard deputy leader and a UDA brigadier, the UDA leadership endorsed \u2018some form of independence for Ulster\u2019 in March 1975.[CITATION-90] There was briefly interest in Ulster independence on the part of some within the SDLP leadership, and the issue was discussed at a high-profile workshop at the Corrymeela Community\u2014a community committed to Christian reconciliation\u2014in 1976.[CITATION-91] A paper suggesting power sharing within an independent Ulster produced by the Ulster Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee (ULCCC), which had been formed after the UWC strike as a forum for loyalist paramilitary organisations, was considered at the meeting. The ULCCC initially included the UDA (though it soon left) as well as the UVF and its linked organisation the Red Hand Commando. Following Craig\u2019s earlier line, the committee argued for a \u2018\u2019 as a means by which to \u2018solve the cause of the conflict once and for all\u2019. Where the committee\u2019s contribution was more distinctive, however, was in adopting a free-market position on economics at the very time when Thatcher, elected as Conservative leader in 1975, was arguing that it provided a way of combating economic decline. Influenced by Trimble, who had worked closely with the paramilitaries during the UWC strike, and by the Queen\u2019s University economist John Simpson, the committee contended that an \u2018independent Ulster would have a totally different tax structure to that of Westminster: more along the lines of the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, a financial structure which would encourage \u201cbig money\u201d into the country\u2019\u2014provided it had access to the European Community. Where earlier advocates of independence had avoided the issue, the committee\u2014in line with the Thatcherite attack on the dependency culture\u2014announced its desire to take \u2018a new look at Social Security which would deal with the work dodgers and layabouts\u2019. It proposed \u2018in the first instance, to have a \u201cgovernment of all the talents\u201d in which every substantial grouping prepared to try and make the independent state work, would be invited to take part\u2019. Yet it held that this would be temporary, lasting only until \u2018disputes over the distribution of goods and services within the new state\u2019 came to the fore and facilitated \u2018the development of a new political structure on left/right lines\u2019.[CITATION-92] Calls for independence receded from the mid-1970s as broader trends worked against the idea. Most notably, British government strategy, particularly under Labour after 1974, involved an increasing financial subvention to Northern Ireland that sought to reduce violence.[CITATION-93] Independence proposals, with a nod towards some form of power sharing, from the New Ulster Political Research Group (NUPRG), which was linked to the UDA and chaired by Barr, briefly gained attention in 1979, especially after they were given the title.[CITATION-94] It was not, however, until after the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement that debates over independence re-entered the foreground of Northern Irish politics. In this context the DUP assumed the prominent role and underpinned its position with an attack on Thatcher, whose economic and social policies it also opposed. The DUP had tentatively toyed with independence in the early 1980s, fearing \u2018betrayal\u2019 as the Thatcher government entered dialogue with the Republic of Ireland.[CITATION-95] Now Paisley lashed out at Thatcher, reworking the contractarian argument with a religious inflection. Speaking at a press conference at his own Martyr\u2019s Memorial Church in Belfast in June 1986, Paisley announced a \u2018campaign of political dissent on behalf of his church\u2019. He argued that the \u2018Thatcher regime\u2019 should \u2018no longer be recognised by Free Presbyterians as a proper and legitimate government\u2019, stressing that \u2018Loyalty to the Queen was not affected because Margaret Thatcher is simply a dictator\u2019\u2014she and her ministers were \u2018usurpers with no God-given authority\u2019.[CITATION-96] The statement appeared more threatening because, later in 1986, Paisley and other DUP leaders accepted an invitation to lead the new paramilitary organisation Ulster Resistance.[CITATION-97] The DUP\u2019s position was meanwhile given a more secular slant by Peter Robinson, the party\u2019s deputy leader and the MP for East Belfast, who was an evangelical Christian but not a Free Presbyterian. Robinson argued that \u2018Unionists would have to consider independence for Northern Ireland if the Anglo-Irish Agreement remained the only terms on which they could stay in the United Kingdom\u2019.[CITATION-98] The barrister and politician Jim Allister, who had joined the DUP at its formation, had already made a case for an Ulster cultural identity shaped by \u2018its distinctly British and Protestant heritage\u2019 and now, fearing being \u2018swallowed up in a theocratic foreign state where our civil and religious liberties would be callously suppressed\u2019, publicly pondered \u2018a form of Dominion Status \u2026 maintaining the link with the Crown\u2019.[CITATION-99] Others besides the DUP considered independence. Driven to \u2018desolation\u2019 by the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Harold McCusker, the UUP MP for Upper Bann, deputy leader of the party and a prominent critic of Thatcher\u2019s economic and social policies, argued that Northern Ireland \u2018could survive as a separate entity\u2019\u2014although he swiftly retreated from this when his comments were disowned by the UUP leadership.[CITATION-100] Independence was mooted more consistently by the Ulster Clubs Movement, whose origins lay in opposition to the re-routing of Orange Order marches in the summer of 1985, which they believed had been done because of pressure from the Republic of Ireland amid Anglo-Irish talks.[CITATION-101] Now, in the late 1980s, Trimble, who had rejoined the UUP, articulated the Ulster Clubs Movement demands for \u2018Dominion Status\u2019 on the basis of the \u2018right to self-determination\u2019.[CITATION-102] However, in the years ahead, calls for independence became more marginal, with the only sustained advocacy coming from the Ulster Independence Committee, which had emerged from the Ulster Clubs.[CITATION-103] The most prominent advocate of integration was Enoch Powell, the British Conservative best known for his opposition to immigration. In October 1974, in an unusual move precipitated by his disagreement with the Conservative leader, Edward Heath, over membership of the European Community and the failure to move in a free-market direction, Powell became UUP MP for South Down. Powell had taken an active interest in Northern Ireland since 1968.[CITATION-104] Well before discussions of Ulster independence gathered pace, he had argued that Northern Ireland was part of the British nation defined by the geographical boundaries of the UK\u2014meaning that unionism, as he later put it, was \u2018the claim to be part of a whole \u2026 the British nation\u2019.[CITATION-105] For Powell, this took the form of an emphasis on institutions, especially Parliament, with the British nation characterised by allegiance to, and the undivided sovereignty of, the Crown-in-Parliament. Having announced his firm opposition to devolution in Scotland and Wales in 1968, two years later Powell argued that the Ulster Unionist \u2018assertion of oneness with the rest of the United Kingdom\u2019 was \u2018at odds with their assertion of this parliamentary independence\u2019\u2014that is, the commitment to Stormont.[CITATION-106] Given that the most prominent opposition to Stormont at this point came from republican circles, this was a provocative argument to make. Nevertheless, it was in one sense a return to the agenda of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century unionists, most notably the academic jurist A.V. Dicey, who opposed Irish Home Rule.[CITATION-107] Powell\u2019s argument also related directly to the Troubles, as he attributed to Stormont some responsibility for sustaining tensions by giving the impression that Northern Ireland was separate from the rest of the UK.[CITATION-108] Integration was more widely mooted after the suspension of Stormont in 1972: the UUP MPs at Westminster considered it at several of their meetings and Paisley came out briefly in its favour, telling the Prime Minister, Heath, in October 1972 that he \u2018saw the eventual solution in the total integration of Northern Ireland into the United Kingdom\u2019.[CITATION-109] On the whole, however, arguments for integration did not publicly gain ground. Indeed, even Powell\u2019s advocacy of it was muted, as he claimed during his first campaign in South Down to endorse the UUUC policy of majority-rule devolution within a future federal UK.[CITATION-110] Instead, Powell, who became close to James Molyneaux, the UUP leader at Westminster, focused on promoting two policies that were consistent with integration: increased parliamentary representation at Westminster in the absence of a local devolved parliament, and expanded local government\u2014whose functions had recently been restricted, partly so as to remove controversial areas, such as the allocation of public housing, from its control.[CITATION-111] Powell was successful in securing the principle of increased representation of Northern Ireland at Westminster in 1978.[CITATION-112] Over time, closer contacts were established between the UUP and the Conservative Party through the Conservative Northern Ireland Committee, set up after the suspension of Stormont and containing individuals amenable to integration, in which most notably Airey Neave but also Julian Amery and John Biggs-Davison played important roles.[CITATION-113] They coalesced in support for the establishment of regional councils with wide-ranging powers over local services, often presented pragmatically by the UUP as \u2018what can be achieved now\u2019.[CITATION-114] Yet after the Conservative return to power in 1979 and Neave\u2019s murder in that year by the Irish National Liberation Army, the military wing of the Irish Republican Socialist Party, the government abandoned the regional council scheme and, seeking devolution, tried to establish a conference involving the Northern Ireland political parties. With the UUP standing aside from the talks and theoretically still committed to regional councils, the party was now more visibly divided between those backing devolution and those supporting integration.In this context, Molyneaux, now overall UUP leader, sought to persuade the Conservative Northern Ireland Committee that \u2018the government should concentrate on improving direct rule\u2014but without using the term \u201cintegration\u201d to describe what it was doing\u2019.[CITATION-115] Yet he was more forthright in his identification with the British nation in the summer of 1982, amid the patriotism stimulated by the Thatcher government\u2019s victory over Argentina in the Falklands War. Weeks before Thatcher herself famously stated that \u2018We have ceased to be a nation in retreat\u2019, and with the final British assault under way, Molyneaux pre-empted her revivalist language to argue that:When the Task Force sailed for the South Atlantic the great mass of people discovered that they were a nation once again. This is the Britain which the old had forgotten and the young had never known. It is a nation which is only at the beginning of the adventure of discovery. It is a greatness in which Ulster shares, for greatness is indivisible.[CITATION-116] It was, however, Powell who did most to develop the case behind the call for integration at this juncture. Countering the suggestion that a power-sharing local assembly was needed to protect the interests of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland, Powell contended that \u2018Parliament \u2026 is the natural protector of all minorities because it is itself made up of minorities\u2019.[CITATION-117] This was, in an important sense, a rebuttal of the pervasive view\u2014used to buttress calls for devolution\u2014that party interests dominated Westminster in a negative way. Yet it also led Powell to confront the \u2018biggest and most significant difference \u2026 between the Province and the rest of the kingdom\u2019: the differing party structure that left Northern Ireland \u2018exiled from the political system that is the United Kingdom as a whole\u2019. Making it clear how this related to local political minorities, he argued: \u2018when, in the county of Durham, the Conservative minority contemplates the fact that it is unlikely to return a majority of Members to this House\u2014or vice versa in Hampshire\u2014it feels no estrangement as a result, because it identifies itself with the cause of the Labour Party, or the Conservative Party, as the case may be, throughout the nation\u2019.[CITATION-118] Even so, Powell did not publicly endorse electoral integration\u2014though he later privately acknowledged that in principle he supported it.[CITATION-119] It was not until the mid-1980s that there was a prominent call for British party political organisation in Northern Ireland, linked to a significant attempt to define the Union in terms of values. The UUP politician and barrister Robert McCartney had previously supported devolution, but after the Anglo-Irish Agreement came to endorse electoral integration. He argued that \u2018British citizens in Northern Ireland are denied the most basic political right of being able \u2026 to vote for a party which might, conceivably, form the government of the country of which they are alleged to be equal citizens.\u2019 Accepting that this could mean the end of the unionist parties, McCartney suggested that it could appeal to many Catholics who were \u2018not pro-Nationalist\u2019 but who had \u2018resented the sectarian and ascendency aspects of Unionism bred by devolution\u2019. Moreover, having previously described the UK as a \u2018pluralist state \u2026 a union between people who believe in liberal democracy\u2019, McCartney\u2019s argument was now underpinned by the view that the \u2018essence of the Union is the sharing of mutual cultural, historic, religious and political values between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom\u2019.[CITATION-120] Electoral integration gained the support of the UUP Young Unionists, who made an important contribution to the argument, pursuing an analysis adumbrated by the British and Irish Communist Organisation (BICO), which had supported British party political organisation in Northern Ireland since the late 1970s and had indeed recently begun to argue for it under the banner of \u2018Equal Citizenship\u2019.[CITATION-121] Alan Chalmers, the chair of the Greater Belfast Young Unionist Association, co-authored a pamphlet that reiterated the familiar contention that Ulster was \u2018governed as a colony\u2019. It went further, however, by taking the BICO line that it was because \u2018the national political parties had no involvement in Northern Ireland for so long and had no members or voters in the province [that] they had no sense of responsibility to the Ulster people\u2019. This, it argued, meant that when \u2018they assumed direct responsibility \u2026 it was inevitable, therefore, that they would behave as colonial overlords\u2019.[CITATION-122] Endorsing electoral integration as policy, the Young Unionist Council spelled out the argument that the British government had only been able to sign the Anglo-Irish Agreement, with Labour support, because \u2018they know they have no votes to gain or lose in Ulster\u2019.[CITATION-123] And in early July 1986, when McCartney spoke to a public meeting of the recently formed Campaign for Equal Citizenship, of which he later became president, he offered the same interpretation of the underlying cause of the current situation.[CITATION-124] Depth was added to the analysis by the pro-unionist University of Ulster politics academic Arthur Aughey who, supporting the equal citizenship campaign, explicitly defined unionism in terms of citizenship\u2014thus responding both to Irish Nationalism and to Powell\u2019s arguments about the British nation. Aughey argued that \u2018for unionists the question is not about nationality; it is about the state\u2019. He continued: \u2018Unionism is concerned primarily with the quality of citizenship within the Union; it is nationalists who are agitated by ideas of nationhood and its extent \u2026 There is no British nation; there are only British citizens\u2019.[CITATION-125] This was, moreover, part of a broader British debate, stretching across the twentieth century, about citizenship and whether it should be defined in terms of a \u2018patriotic attachment\u2019 to the British nation or in an attachment to the state.[CITATION-126] Yet, whatever its intellectual merits, electoral integration faltered on the ground. McCartney was unable to persuade his UUP colleagues to adopt a commitment to electoral integration at the party conference in late 1986, and a subsequent attempt to establish Conservative Associations in Northern Ireland floundered amid a lack of interest from Conservative Central Office and a failure to win unionist votes.[CITATION-127] In the early 1970s, the now little-known pressure group the New Ulster Movement (NUM) suggested ways to revise Stormont that were of long-term significance to the debate on power-sharing devolution. The NUM was formed in 1969, with the aim of developing moderate unionist policies and supporting the prime minister, Terence O\u2019Neill.[CITATION-128] Yet it soon took its arguments further. In 1970, with some of its leading figures about to leave to form the Alliance Party, the NUM stood firmly by the commitment to devolved government but with a \u2018duty \u2026 to seek and obtain the co-operation of nationalists\u2019.[CITATION-129] The following year, the NUM attached a critique of the Westminster model to its arguments. In a pamphlet written by John Whyte, a lecturer in political science at Queen\u2019s University, the NUM argued that the model worked well only if there were \u2018two strong parties, competing with each other on fairly equal terms\u2019\u2014as was currently the case with Conservative and Labour. In other circumstances, the NUM argued, it was \u2018a system which can easily lead to tyranny because it produces a remarkable concentration of power in the government of the day\u2019. The NUM now called for proportional representation (PR) at Stormont elections, with seats allocated to parties according to vote share. This was the basis on which Stormont had operated between 1921 and 1929, but the NUM suggested \u2018as a long-term possibility\u2014the introduction of proportional representation in government\u2019.[CITATION-130] The NUM\u2019s focus was on Northern Ireland, but in calling for PR it aligned itself with the British Liberal Party, which had been committed to electoral reform since the mid-1920s and had become more vocal from the mid-1960s as its share of the vote had increased without a corresponding rise in its number of MPs.[CITATION-131] Following Stormont\u2019s prorogation, the NUM moved even more explicitly towards the \u2018sharing of power \u2026 in proportion to party strength in the Assembly\u2019, with the use of a \u2018weighted majority \u2026 in controversial areas\u2019.[CITATION-132] Faulkner, as UUP leader and former Northern Ireland prime minister, also moved towards power sharing but did so with a degree of reluctance, privately recognising that it was \u2018necessary\u2019 but publicly stating that he was \u2018not opposed\u2019 to it.[CITATION-133] He was responding to the stance of the British government, which between autumn 1972 and spring 1973 had explicitly indicated its commitment to giving the minority a share of executive power. Yet, amid the rise of the UUUC, the UWC strike and the collapse of the Sunningdale Agreement, this path was politically rejected by most unionists. Thereafter, discussion of power sharing in a devolved Northern Ireland was eclipsed by discussion of it in an independent Ulster.It was not until the 1980s that power sharing in Northern Ireland began to be consistently advocated by unionists, with paramilitaries and their associated political bodies taking the lead and doing so in the context of resistance to Thatcherism. An important milestone came in 1981 when the UDA-linked NUPRG\u2014which had proposed Ulster independence in 1979\u2014became the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party (ULDP) and made clear that its proposals for government, \u2018supported by the substantial majority of both religious communities in Ulster\u2019, applied both to independence and to remaining in the UK. Echoing the NUM critique, the ULDP sought \u2018a system of parliament and government better suited to the Ulster people than a juggled version of the Westminster type\u2019.[CITATION-134] The overall change of position had resulted from a power struggle within the UDA that saw Glenn Barr leave and John McMichael, a UDA brigadier in South Belfast who was dismissive of Ulster independence, become ULDP chair.[CITATION-135] In 1986, the UDA\u2014now acting in its own name\u2014was emphatic in its support for equal citizenship, but argued that British party political organisation should occur within a devolved settlement that would also apply to Scotland and Wales, as well as to the regions of England. Describing itself as \u2018almost entirely working class\u2019, the UDA argued that regional inequalities and high levels of unemployment were the result of the government\u2019s \u2018gross mismanagement\u2019, which had destroyed \u2018our manufacturing base\u2019.[CITATION-136] The economic decline of manufacturing industry was part of a longer-term trend, but it had accelerated under the impact of both the Troubles and the Thatcher government, which, in celebrating the financial and services sectors, had embraced that structural shift. Strikingly, in Northern Ireland, the manufacturing sector had contracted by more than 50 per cent between 1971 and 1991.[CITATION-137] Mirroring the corporatist outlook that had enjoyed its apogee under the Labour governments of 1964 to 1970, the UDA sought a \u2018far sighted strategy for our industry and economy \u2026 one agreed to by the C.B.I. [Confederation of British Industry], the unions and Government\u2019 which would encourage the \u2018regeneration of the industrial sector\u2019. Crucially, the UDA sought PR across the UK in order to bring about \u2018a realignment of British politics and coalition governments\u2019.[CITATION-138] This point resonated in a British context where, at the last General Election in 1983, the Conservative share of the vote had fallen slightly from 1979 but\u2014with the opposition split between Labour and the Social Democratic Party (SDP)\u2013Liberal Alliance\u2014the party had increased its number of seats. The UDA position should also be placed against the stance of Sinn F\u00e9in, whose development McMichael had studied carefully.[CITATION-139] Under the leadership of Gerry Adams from late 1983, Sinn F\u00e9in had increasingly identified itself as a socialist party, speaking of the interests of the Irish working class and emphasising its commitment to substantial state intervention in the economy.[CITATION-140] The Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), linked to the UVF, also saw itself as a left-of-centre working-class group.[CITATION-141] Its origins lay in the Volunteer Political Party, which had been formed in 1974 and was opposed to independence.[CITATION-142] In 1979. the Progressive Unionist Group, soon to become Party, announced its commitment to devolution, including PR, and to the \u2018establishment of a voting partnership with all those who wish to pursue a common Programme of Social and Economic Advancement for the broad mass of the N. Ireland people\u2019.[CITATION-143] In the 1985 local government elections, held before the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the PUP campaigned to resist job losses caused by \u2018privatisation in the public sector\u2019 and to oppose \u2018the increasing attacks upon the British Welfare State\u2019.[CITATION-144] (From 1983, the privatisation of nationalised industries, including British Telecom and British Gas, was an increasingly important part of Thatcher\u2019s agenda.) In Northern Ireland, the PUP sought \u2018movement towards more general acceptability of sharing responsibility within a broadened structure of local government\u2019, embracing the \u2018principle of proportionality\u2019.[CITATION-145] After the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the PUP joined the call for British party political organisation, but, like the UDA, remained committed to devolution.[CITATION-146] The PUP also made its commitment to working with other left-wing parties clear. In early 1987, it presented a policy document to the British Labour Party\u2019s decision-making National Executive Committee that called for \u2018a sound regional planning policy to combat poverty [and] increase investment in regional industries\u2019. This document also proclaimed the PUP\u2019s dedication to the trade union movement, which\u2014viewed as an obstruction to the operation of the market\u2014had seen its powers restricted by legislation passed earlier in the decade by the Thatcher government.[CITATION-147] By this stage, in a document called, the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG), a new incarnation of the NUPRG chaired by McMichael, had announced its commitment to \u2018shared responsibility\u2019 and \u2018proportionality\u2019. There was little here that was technically new, but it did receive considerable attention\u2014including from John Hume, the SDLP leader. What was striking was that it framed its arguments with a degree of sophistication, arguing: \u2018Majority rule in deeply divided societies is likely to be profoundly undemocratic, and the only democratic system is one that allows participation in government by coalition of all groups, majority and minority, on a more or less permanent basis\u2019.[CITATION-148] The Republic of Ireland government reported speculation that the UPRG had \u2018brought in a \u201cprofessional hand\u201d to draft the final version\u2019, probably the politics academic Sidney Elliott from Queen\u2019s University, on whose work part of the report drew.[CITATION-149] Later in 1987, McMichael was murdered by the IRA, following a tip-off from within the UDA.[CITATION-150] Yet this did not affect the overall social and economic line taken. The following year, the ULDP mirrored the PUP in stating: \u2018If we wish to reverse the iniquities of Thatcherism we would need to join a common platform with other anti-Thatcher parties\u2019. It went on:We can not support the vision of society being constructed by Thatcher, a society where the nation\u2019s resources are squandered, where greed has become a religion, and where democracy continues to be eroded. Present Conservatism is not Unionism, it is a calculated appeal to those in the SE of England; the people of Scotland, Wales and the NE of England have become increasingly detached.[CITATION-151] In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a dramatic increase in loyalist sectarian killings, which led to the banning of the UDA. This level of violence sat uneasily with, and hindered the advancement of, the political arguments that the paramilitaries continued to make. A 1992 joint statement from the UDA and the UVF expressed their explicit commitment to \u2018proportionality\u2019 in the exercise of executive power.[CITATION-152] And their policy documents continued to be animated by a repudiation, as the PUP put it in 1995, of \u2018the values and ethos of the New Right\u2019, even after the fall of Thatcher.[CITATION-153] The other important advocate of power sharing in the 1990s, the UUP, adopted that position more slowly than the paramilitaries. The 1984 policy documentargued for devolving the \u2018administrative and functional powers\u2019 held by local government elsewhere in the UK. Administrative devolution, as it was called, was an attempt to forge a compromise between integrationist and devolutionist elements, but it was also presented as a means through which \u2018majority and minority representatives can participate without prejudice to their position on the constitutional question\u2019.[CITATION-154] This, in itself, might have appeared to be a limited commitment, but contacts between Frank Miller, the UUP General Secretary, and Republic of Ireland officials showed its significance. Worried about the rise of Sinn F\u00e9in, Miller argued that the \u2018tone of the document was \u2026 deliberately cast in a moderate and conciliatory fashion\u2019.[CITATION-155] In the event, the initiative came to nought. Miller renewed his efforts in 1987, as part of the Task Force set up by the UUP and DUP leaderships with a remit to consult a wide range of unionist opinion about alternatives to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Co-authored by McCusker from the UUP and Robinson from the DUP, the Task Force report called for \u2018Unionist flexibility\u2019, and suggested that weighted majorities should be used in the first period of any new devolved assembly.[CITATION-156] As Republic of Ireland officials noted, there was \u2018a case for seeing the Task Force report as a new departure in Unionist thinking\u2019, at least so far as the established parties were concerned.[CITATION-157] Yet the initiative was scuppered, with neither Paisley nor Molyneaux, as DUP and UUP leaders respectively, giving their approval, prompting Miller to leave the UUP and Robinson (temporarily) to resign as DUP deputy leader.Nevertheless, from the late 1980s there was an increased desire in the UUP to present the \u2018virtues and merits of the Union\u2019 to audiences outside Northern Ireland. This was in part a response to the shock of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the sense that unionists had been betrayed by their exclusion from the discussion process.[CITATION-158] It also occurred amid a realisation, among parts of Ulster Unionist opinion, that compromise might bring an end to the Troubles. This in turn sprang from an appreciation that the republican leadership considered that military victory was not likely.[CITATION-159] Together, these factors facilitated the UUP\u2019s adoption, in 1994, of a commitment to proportionality: a local assembly where \u2018Executive power would be exercised \u2026 broadly in proportion to Party strengths\u2019. Notably, the UUP made this case in a way that related to the end of the Cold War. Citing pledges made in the 1990 Charter of Paris, agreed at a summit that was effectively the peace conference of the Cold War, to protect the \u2018ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of national minorities\u2019, the UUP suggested that this could be a model for co-operation in Northern Ireland. Seeking the removal of the Republic of Ireland\u2019s territorial claim on Northern Ireland from its constitution, the UUP argued that the international precedent provided an example of the \u2018recognition of existing frontiers, abandonment of territorial ambition and mutual co-operation\u2019.[CITATION-160] The process gathered pace when Trimble, who had been an increasingly prominent MP since 1990, became UUP leader in 1995. Taking inspiration from Karl Popper\u2019s(1957), Trimble was determined to resist the teleological strain in Irish Nationalism that saw events leading inexorably towards Irish unity.[CITATION-161] Trimble was critical of moves towards further European integration as envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty, but welcomed the commitments to religious and cultural minorities within existing borders as part of the \u2018development of post-nationalist Europe\u2019.[CITATION-162] This was also an important attempt to strike a conciliatory note, as the pro-European John Hume had argued from the early 1990s that in a post-nationalist Europe existing identities could coexist with other allegiances and offer a means of resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland.[CITATION-163] Trimble\u2019s arguments reverberated amid talk of a \u2018New Unionism\u2019, which shared common ground with the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in suggesting that the union was based on values and that unionism was defined in terms of citizenship.[CITATION-164] Yet there were important differences in how the case was made. As Arthur Aughey (who had supported electoral integration in the 1980s) put it, \u2018New Unionism\u2019 was concerned with making \u2018a positive case for the Union as a multi-national state\u2019, offering \u2018multi-cultural citizenship\u2019.[CITATION-165] This related to concerns in a wider UK setting in which a distinctly English nationalism was emerging, arguably in response to European integration, and a \u2018separatist\u2019 Scottish nationalism had recently grown in strength and coherence under the impact of Thatcher.[CITATION-166] New Unionism further reflected a context where a commitment to \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 was not simply prevalent on the Left but took Conservative forms\u2014appearing to fit the reality of British, and especially English, society, which, shaped by immigration, was partly characterised by the diversity of its ethnic minority groups.[CITATION-167] Trimble also argued that the UK was a multi-national state. With an eye to his earlier emphasis on the community of the British Isles, he had asserted in 1992 that \u2018Being in one state is natural to the nations of the British Isles, for their destinies have been inextricably intertwined throughout recorded history\u2019.[CITATION-168] What was significant from the middle of the 1990s, however, was that Trimble considered that his view chimed with the pro-devolution agenda of Tony Blair, recently elected as Labour Party leader.[CITATION-169] This, in turn, reflected the \u2018new orthodoxy\u2019 that, in constitutional terms, the UK was a union state, characterised by imperfect integration and with its origins in the two unions with Scotland and Ireland, rather than being the product of the extension of the sovereignty of the English Parliament.[CITATION-170] Trimble told the UUP annual conference in October 1996 that, with Blair\u2019s New Labour in the ascendancy, \u2018unionism is winning the intellectual argument\u2019, adding: \u2018It is only unionism that can genuinely be multinational and multicultural. It believes that the sum of the whole is greater than that of the parts. This is a better vision that anything sectarian Irish nationalism can offer\u2019.[CITATION-171] This view was repeated in the UUP manifesto for the May 1997 General Election.[CITATION-172] At the same time, Trimble continued to stress the commitment to \u2018proportionality\u2019 in the government of Northern Ireland\u2014doing so, for example, to a US audience the month after the Labour victory.[CITATION-173] With executive power sharing, together with a form of PR, the single transferable vote, embedded in the Good Friday Agreement signed in April 1998 and approved in referenda across Ireland the following month, albeit with significant opposition from the DUP, Trimble now argued that unionism, defined by its values, especially diversity, was \u2018based on a sense of Britishness\u2019.[CITATION-174] Trimble did not expand on the concept of Britishness, but his argument coincided with wider usage of the term. Strikingly, at this very juncture, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, emphasised Britishness as a progressive force in the new devolved UK, with a Scottish Parliament and Welsh National Assembly soon to be established, and as a means of confronting the Scottish Nationalists.[CITATION-175] Amid fierce debate on the future of Northern Ireland, time and again the concerns of Ulster Unionists reflected the wider dilemmas faced by the UK state during a period of considerable change. Unsettled by the loss of Stormont, Ulster Unionists disagreed with each other as much as they challenged nationalists. By the early 1990s, the debate was increasingly dominated by competing calls for devolution\u2014majority-rule from the DUP and power-sharing from the UUP\u2014but at times during the 1970s and 1980s, both integration and independence had appeared as serious options.In the first place, Ulster Unionists engaged with arguments about the constitutional and national make-up of the UK. Until 1972, the existence of Stormont sat at odds with the widely held opinion that the UK was a centralised unitary state, but thereafter the position of Northern Ireland was debated as part of a broader constitutional discussion. The basis of Powell\u2019s argument for integration, and against devolution, was that the British nation was defined by the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament but this view did not gain significant support in Northern Ireland. Instead, many Ulster Unionists argued in the 1970s for the establishment of a federal UK, a loose notion that served the political purpose of enabling them to push for the restoration of majority rule, emboldened by the fact that the Royal Commission on the Constitution had advocated this as the basis of devolution for Scotland and Wales. By the 1990s, the UUP was arguing that the UK was a multi-national state, which was in line with both an understanding of the UK as a union state and New Labour\u2019s commitment to devolution. Even advocates of Ulster independence struggled to argue that there was an Ulster nation, but it is important to remember that Scottish Nationalism did not develop fully until the 1980s and English nationalism only advanced in the 1990s. In the mid-1980s, supporters of electoral integration had made a case that the Union should be defined in terms of its values of plurality and diversity\u2014an argument that was developed further by New Unionists supporting power sharing and embracing multi-culturalism in the 1990s. But, as commentators have increasingly noted, in Northern Ireland, as elsewhere in the UK, there was an inherent difficulty in pinning down precisely what these values were, even if Britishness was an attractive label to give them.[CITATION-176] Ulster Unionist thinking further echoed concerns about relationships within the UK. Considering that neither the Conservatives nor Labour were interested in protecting Northern Ireland\u2019s position within the UK, from the mid-1970s Ulster Unionists expressed a deep scepticism about Westminster political parties and individual politicians that, in a less virulent form, was coming to feature in British attitudes towards the political system as a whole. At the same time, some Ulster Unionists exhibited a particular unease at some of the societal changes associated with permissiveness. From its evangelical Protestant perspective, the DUP was the foremost voice here, but its position bore some resemblance to views within the Conservative Party. Unionism had long straddled well-established left and right divides on economic and social policy\u2014and this continued in the late twentieth century in a debate that focused increasingly on responses to Thatcherism. In the mid-1970s, advocates of independence embraced Thatcherite economic policies, including cuts to direct taxation and an attack on the dependency culture. Yet by the 1980s, it was opposition to Thatcher that was most apparent. The DUP criticised Thatcher\u2019s management of the economy and position on the welfare state, while the paramilitaries, calling for power sharing, launched a full-scale assault on Thatcherism amid the impact of deindustrialisation. They emphasised their class-based opposition, called for state planning and sought to work with others on the Left, giving renewed life to calls for PR to reform the electoral system.Ulster Unionist debates also mirrored the UK\u2019s awkward relationship with the wider world. With the Empire having earlier played a part in Ulster Unionist identity, Craig\u2019s critique of Britain\u2019s international decline mirrored that of the Conservative Monday Club, which sought to resist decolonisation. Nevertheless, overall, it was the Ulster Unionist adoption of the argument that under Direct Rule Northern Ireland was being treated undemocratically and like a colony that was most notable. Suggesting that the experience of being a colony was an undesirable one for the people concerned, this example serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle of the UK as a whole to grapple with its imperial legacy. So far as the European Community was concerned, criticism of membership from an economic perspective underpinned the arguments of one of the most forceful advocates of independence, Kennedy Lindsay, in the 1970s. What became more prominent over time, however, was the argument, advanced by the DUP, that membership threatened British parliamentary sovereignty. This position, connected by the DUP with calls for majority-rule devolution, assumed great importance in the 1990s among elements of the Conservative Party and UKIP\u2014and in recent years, with the DUP established as the largest unionist party and sharing power with Sinn F\u00e9in, it has been right at the forefront of debates over Brexit.",

Gibbon, The Origins of Ulster Unionism (Manchester, 1975), esp. p. 136, adopted a Marxist approach to argue that in the 1890s the urban bourgeoisie shaped Ulster Unionism into a type of nationalism, emphasising self-determination and distinctive cultural characteristics. A. Jackson, The Ulster Party: Irish Unionists in the House of Commons, 1884\u20131911 (Oxford, 1989), pp. 11\u201312, drew on sociology, characterising nations by solidarity, to argue that Ulster Unionists could have developed claims to identify with the Ulster nation, but did not do so because it would have meant adopting the language of Irish Nationalists. In contrast, J. Loughlin, Ulster Unionism and British National Identity since 1885 (London, 1995), pp. 195\u20136, argued that \u2018unlike the Scots, Welsh and English, the unionists lacked an authentic myth of ethnic nationality as the basis on which an Ulster nationalism could develop\u2019. Walker, Ulster Unionist Party, pp. 3\u20135, 284, concludes that \u2018Ulster Unionism took shape as a form of nationalism, notwithstanding its preference to maintain the Union rather than pursue independence\u2019.",
