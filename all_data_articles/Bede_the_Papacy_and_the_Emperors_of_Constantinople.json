    "article": "This article argues that the historical writings of the Venerable Bede (d. 735) can also be used by scholars examining the political history of the Eastern Roman Empire in the seventh and eighth centuries. Although Byzantinists have increasingly drawn upon texts written in Syriac, Arabic, and other eastern languages in their scholarship, sources composed in the post-Roman West have yet to be utilised to the same extent. Bede is particularly informative for the reigns of Phocas (602\u201310), Constans II (641\u201368), and Justinian II (685\u201395, 705\u201311), three emperors who were vilified in later Greek sources. By considering the near-contemporary perspectives preserved in Bede\u2019sandalongside the eastern evidence, a more nuanced understanding can be reached for these emperors\u2019 final years. Moreover, Bede\u2019s unique reports strengthen the view that papal history should be integrated into studies of imperial politics. The papacy emerges as a loyal partisan of Phocas in 610 and an institution linked to the growing unrest against Constans in the 660s, while in the eighth century Bede recounted that Pope Constantine gave unheeded advice to Justinian prior to his downfall. In all three cases, Bede yields new insights into the ties that bound together Rome and Constantinople, further demonstrating the utility of Latin sources for reconstructing events in the Mediterranean, even at the end of Late Antiquity.From the genesis of the Gregorian mission to the fractious kings of his own age, the Venerable Bede provides scholars today with a detailed and skilful retelling of early English history. This account is of course a carefully shaped one, affected by, among other things, the monk-scholar\u2019s desire to correct kings and monks alike in contemporary Northumbria.[CITATION-1] Walter Goffart famously searched through Bede\u2019s narrative for the ghost of the troublesome Bishop Wilfrid of York, highlighting in particular the role played by monastic politics in shaping the Northumbrian\u2019s words.[CITATION-2] The recent work of Richard Shaw, meanwhile, has uncovered the documentary sources used in the, in turn revealing just how little Bede and his informants knew of the 660s, to take one example.[CITATION-3] The impact of factions and sources continues to be debated, but it is evident that by digging deeper into Bede\u2019s writings, historians have reached a much fuller understanding of early medieval Britain.[CITATION-4] What is less clear, even now, is how Bede saw the wider world of Late Antiquity, and the extent to which his words can yield insights into the history of regions beyond Britain, such as the eastern Mediterranean. Other contemporary Insular texts are certainly relevant for the study of the world outside of Northumbria, most clearly Stephen of Ripon\u2019sfor historians of the Merovingian kingdoms and the biblical commentaries emanating from Canterbury for scholars of late antique learning.[CITATION-5] The same, I suggest, is the case for Bede. Although he did not set out to write a history of Christendom as a whole, by situating Britain within the wider Christian community whenever his narrative required it, Bede also, inadvertently or not, shed light on many obscure events taking place elsewhere, even as far away as Constantinople.This underexplored resource is of particular importance for historians of the (Eastern) Roman Empire, for whom the seventh and eighth centuries remain murky, with debates still to be had on the nature of now lost sources and even the historical narrative itself.[CITATION-6] The emperors of Constantinople had been shaken first by the \u2018last great war of antiquity\u2019 with Sasanian Persia (603\u201228), and then the unprecedented success of the Arab conquests from the 630s onwards, which pushed the empire\u2019s southern and eastern frontiers back to Anatolia.[CITATION-7] Perhaps due to the shattered confidence of the Roman intelligentsia, or more mundane reasons of source preservation, there are also no surviving Greek histories written by contemporaries between630 and the 780s, contributing to the impression that an atmosphere of crisis permeated the weakened empire.[CITATION-8] Culture and politics are, of course, rarely shaped only by disasters, and recent scholarship has increasingly teased out the still dynamic nature of late Roman society in this period of conflict. Study of the seventh-century monothelete controversy, a Christological dispute with a poor reputation in traditional historiography as a doomed attempt at doctrinal compromise, has been particularly revitalised, with the imperial position now more positively interpreted as an argument with contemporary support.[CITATION-9] Much more work, however, is required to make sense of the empire\u2019s ongoing connections with the \u2018barbarian\u2019 West.While connections between England and the eastern Mediterranean have been discussed for the better-documented tenth and eleventh centuries, similar investigations into the age of Bede are rare even in recent years, with contacts often deemed to have been severely limited in his lifetime.[CITATION-10] When scholarly attention does fall on possible links between Bede\u2019s world and the eastern Mediterranean, the emphasis thus far has been on his biblical exegesis, contemporary learning, and the available archaeological evidence, rather than Bede\u2019s considerable historical corpus, hisand.[CITATION-11] This article instead focuses on these two texts and argues that, if Bede\u2019s words are read alongside familiar eastern histories, these Northumbrian sources can help Byzantinists to reconstruct the political history of the Roman Empire.[CITATION-12] Although the focus here is on matters of high politics, this analysis is nonetheless an important reminder that post-Roman texts can also be utilised to chronicle the interconnected world of Late Antiquity. This is best demonstrated by the papacy, which was particularly important to Northumbrian authors, but was still an institution within the Roman Empire and enmeshed within an imperial church.[CITATION-13] Given Bede\u2019s sources and his own preferences, it is inevitable that much of the evidence discussed here is connected to the papacy; yet it would be misleading to separate the bishops of Rome from their eastern counterparts. The recent call by Bronwen Neil and Matthew Dal Santo to integrate Pope Gregory the Great more fully into the world of Justinian and Muhammad applies to that pontiff\u2019s successors as well, for they likewise involved themselves in both the messy world of imperial politics and western ecclesiastical affairs, two aspects of their careers that need to be brought together and discussed on equal terms.[CITATION-14] Bede\u2019s comments on papal history are of course overwhelmingly focused on one side of this equation, but, when fully integrated within an imperial context, they nonetheless provide interesting reading for Byzantinists, for the three examples discussed here all illustrate the bishops of Rome\u2019s investment in Constantinopolitan politics.The city of Rome and its place during the civil war between Emperor Phocas (602\u201310) and the usurper Heraclius is considered first, then the deeper crisis facing Constantinople in the 660s under Constans II (641\u201368). Finally, the concluding section investigates the circumstances surrounding the second overthrow of Emperor Justinian II (685\u201395, 705\u201311). All three were crucial moments in the empire\u2019s history, not least because each culminated in the transition from one emperor to another\u2014emperors who have, it is safe to say, rarely featured in studies of Bede. At a time when Constantinople faced civil war, religious controversies, and the Arab conquests, the empire\u2019s influence in the West is often said to have waned, while post-Roman Europe likewise is said to have known ever less of events in the eastern Mediterranean as contacts declined.[CITATION-15] On the surface, the struggles considered here certainly seem to be rather representative of the empire\u2019s tumultuous experiences over this century, with each emperor\u2019s downfall almost emblematic of the instability that contributed to the growing rupture between East and West. However, the recent wave of studies on the empire\u2019s connections to the western kingdoms has revised this picture somewhat, demonstrating in particular that the far-ranging consequences of these conflicts in the eastern Mediterranean, whether on the economies of post-Roman Europe or Bede\u2019s own world-view, should not be dismissed out of hand.[CITATION-16] If nothing else, given the increasing recognition by Byzantinists of the utility of sources written in Syriac, Arabic, and other eastern languages, it seems appropriate to consider the opposite perspective as well and explore contemporary Latin texts for similar insights. While the three emperors considered here all possess a miserable reputation in later Greek sources as tyrants, modern scholarship has increasingly contested these interpretations by considering previously overlooked texts.[CITATION-17] Bede is another near-contemporary voice who can be used to revise the traditional narrative, but his works have not attracted the same attention from Byzantinists. Taking Bede\u2019s words as a starting point, this article argues that when his corpus is placed into dialogue with the available Greek sources, fresh light can be shone on otherwise obscure moments of imperial history. Constantinople\u2019s foreign policy, for example, is always a shadowy topic, but it becomes all the more so during the crisis of the seventh century. However, by considering together Bede\u2019s account of events in the last years of Constans II and a Chinese dynastic history, the outlines of Roman interests abroad can still be glimpsed.Although I do not present here a comprehensive reassessment of connections between Britain and the eastern Mediterranean in the seventh and eighth centuries, the fact that the domestic and international orientations of the empire can be discerned in Bede nonetheless speaks for the persistence of intellectual links between the eastern Mediterranean and the post-Roman West. Eastern sources for imperial history and post-Roman texts from the Latin West have, understandably, been considered largely in isolation from each other, but the sweeping perspective offered here, stretching from Wearmouth\u2013Jarrow to Tang China, provides an important illustration of the value of taking a transregional approach to the sources, even at the end of Late Antiquity.The woes faced by the Roman Empire in the seventh century are often traced back to the reign of the usurper Phocas, who seized power from Emperor Maurice in 602.[CITATION-18] The following years were not kind to the empire, beset as it was by a renewed war with Persia and political purges in Constantinople, even if the extent of these troubles was exaggerated by later anti-Phocan sources.[CITATION-19] The civil war launched in 608 by another usurper, Heraclius, was likewise accompanied by much violence in the eastern provinces, including riots in the Levant and a brutal struggle for Egypt, both of which set the stage for the eventual Persian and Arab conquests of previously untouched Roman heartlands.[CITATION-20] Little, however, is known of the attitudes of imperial Italy, or indeed much about Rome at all between the death of Pope Gregory the Great in 604 and the fall of Phocas in 610, for we no longer have the pope\u2019s letters to guide us. The, and in particular the batch of retrospective papal biographies probably composed in the 640s, informs us about the pontificates of Sabinian, Boniface III, and Boniface IV, while from Paul the Deacon, writing in the eighth century, we learn of a truce negotiated between Phocas and the Lombards.[CITATION-21] We can speculate that within the papacy there was some sense of continuity, for Boniface III and Boniface IV (607 and 608\u201215) are argued to have been aligned with Pope Gregory\u2019s vision, and that peace in Italy was valued, but we can say little more than that.[CITATION-22] As a result, even though Heraclius\u2019 revolt was launched from North Africa, our understanding of how Italy reacted to the rebellion, particularly in 610, the year of Phocas\u2019 downfall, remains poor. The material evidence consists of the well-known Column of Phocas erected in Rome in 608 and a solidus minted in Ravenna in the name of Phocas between September 609 and September 610, an identification based solely on the inclusion of the indiction (a given year in the fifteen-year Roman fiscal cycle) on the coin.[CITATION-23] The literary evidence is no better, with scholarly speculation limited to an unclear report that African grain-fleets did not sail to loyalist Rome at the beginning of the revolt, as well as Phocas\u2019 possible grant of permission for the Pantheon in Rome to be turned into a church in May 609 or 613.[CITATION-24] In the former case, a loyal Rome in 608, at the very beginning of the civil war, is hardly unexpected. The latter suggestion fits with the well-known cordial relations between the papacy and Phocas, but, as the conversion of the Pantheon cannot be dated with any certainty, it remains at best an unclear indication of loyalties in Rome at the end of Phocas\u2019 reign.It can be surmised from this brief survey that we know very little about the loyalties of imperial Italy during this civil war, even as the East was seemingly tearing itself apart. Yet Bede\u2019s, surprisingly, provides a hitherto unconsidered hint of the papacy\u2019s stance in 610. After describing the success of the Gregorian mission to convert Kent, the Northumbrian historian noted several instances of the successors of Augustine of Canterbury communicating with the pope in Rome.[CITATION-25] In Shaw\u2019s analysis, these visits all sought a papal pallium for the new metropolitan of Canterbury, a request dictated by the death of the previous office-holder.[CITATION-26] For the journey undertaken in 609\u201210, Bede further noted that Mellitus, the envoy from England, had attended a synod in Rome dealing with monastic life in Italy, which took place in \u2018the eighth year of the reign of Emperor Phocas, the thirteenth indiction, 27th February [610]\u2019.[CITATION-27] The precise, and formulaic, dating clause is probably an indication that papal documents, whether the synodal acts themselves or a letter containing this detail, were available to Bede. As was noted by Kenneth Harrison, this is the only example of Bede using indiction years in thewithout it being an explicit quotation from an official document, which is certainly suggestive of this formula\u2019s origins in the records of a Roman synod, since it is unlikely that Bede would have used the imperial dating system if he had arrived at that date himself or through non-documentary sources.[CITATION-28] If Bede\u2019s dating clause was indeed lifted from an official record, then we can say with certainty that this particular synod took place in interesting times, for in early 610 the forces of Emperor Phocas were in full retreat following their defeat in Egypt in late 609 and soon coins were minted in the name of the usurper Heraclius in Cyprus and Alexandretta in Syria.[CITATION-29] In this situation, the invocation of Phocas in this dating formula may well have had a political meaning, for this normally straightforward notice is surely less neutral when read in the light of the emperor\u2019s downfall. As Heraclius did not invoke Phocas\u2019 name and instead used his own and his father\u2019s image (albeit wrapped in consular rather than imperial iconography) on his coins, it would be reasonable to suppose that if Heraclian forces were in control of Rome, another dating formula that did not reference the regnal year of Phocas would have been used.[CITATION-30] In turn, this could potentially help Byzantinists to narrow down Heraclian forces\u2019 itinerary for the attack on Constantinople, as it becomes plausible that Italy, or at least Rome, was ignored by the rebels and that their eastern gains were made while their western flank was left open to men still loyal to Phocas. The inclusion of Phocas\u2019 regnal year in this clause is then significant, as it is an otherwise unknown indicator of Rome\u2019s loyalty to Constantinople, even as late as February 610, and the only precisely dated clue to the papacy\u2019s reaction to the ongoing civil war.Last but not least, the fact that bishops could allegedly be gathered from across the province further suggests that the civil war was not all-consuming in Italy, at least when compared to the chaos in Egypt and the Levant. Indeed, in 609 the patriarch of Jerusalem was deposed and both the patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch were murdered.[CITATION-31] Pope Boniface\u2019s situation, by comparison, was seemingly a great deal more secure and gave him the stability needed to focus on more domestic issues. The report that this synod dealt with the conduct of monks certainly meshes well with Boniface IV\u2019s contemporary needs, as he is generally seen as a member of the monastic faction within the papacy that competed with a clerical faction for the papal seat following Gregory the Great\u2019s death.[CITATION-32] Such a distinction is perhaps too broad a generalisation, but if this synod was indeed attended by \u2018the bishops of Italy\u2019, as Bede reports, the meeting is still a telling indication of Boniface\u2019s domestic priorities in the opening stages of the crisis of empire.Nevertheless, some doubt must be raised over this particular formula, as the arrangement of regnal year, indiction, then the date, as in this dating clause, is a rare find in the sources. Similar clauses in other near-contemporary papal letters quoted by Bede begin with the date, then the regnal year and the indiction.[CITATION-33] Surviving formulas used in seventh-century councils within the empire meanwhile generally placed the regnal year first, then the date and the indiction, for example at the Lateran Synod in Rome in 649 and the Third Council of Constantinople in 680\u201281.[CITATION-34] Two exceptions to these trends, however, provide some reassurance that Bede did use a genuine dating clause directly lifted from a pro-Phocan source. The first is a decree issued by a synod held in Rome in July 595, which opens with the regnal year of Emperor Maurice, then the indiction and the date.[CITATION-35] The same is true in the spurious record of a 679 synod convened under Pope Agatho.[CITATION-36] Although its content was heavily interpolated in the eleventh century, Wilhelm Levison convincingly argued that the dating clause and other elements of theof this synod were genuine products of the seventh century, partly due to the lengthy, and correct, invocation of the three reigning co-emperors, a detail that would have surely eluded later Anglo-Norman forgers.[CITATION-37] We may then suggest that genuine products of the seventh-century papal chancery could have followed different dating conventions, making it plausible that Bede had indeed derived the full formula for the 610 synod from an official document from Rome.The context for this passage provides one final clue to Bede\u2019s access to the relevant papal documents, as, in his account of Mellitus\u2019 return to England, he noted that the envoy supposedly brought with him letters \u2018the same pope sent to the beloved of God, Archbishop Laurentius, and all the clergy, likewise to King \u00c6thelberht and the English people\u2019.[CITATION-38] As noted again by Shaw, although this appears to be a broad and rather vague statement, it does nonetheless reflect the contemporary papal practice of addressing their letters to large groups, if the many instances of Gregory the Great addressing the secular officials, clergy, and people as a general collective are any indication.[CITATION-39] The lack of surviving synodal acts during the civil war, on either side, does make it impossible to confirm whether such a dating formula, as preserved in Bede, was indeed a firm indication of specific loyalties, but even so, it remains a previously overlooked clue to the papacy\u2019s actions in this enigmatic period. Such an interpretation certainly corroborates the story as it appears in other sources, for Phocas was portrayed rather favourably in papal texts, a consistent pattern dating back to Gregory the Great\u2019s reaction to his seizure of power in 602.[CITATION-40] While Phocas\u2019 reputation in later sources remains a poor one, contemporary texts were kinder to the emperor. He was certainly not an incompetent one, for the Balkan frontier remained stable and the eastern front with Persia experienced no disasters\u2014until Heraclius\u2019 revolt fatally destabilised the imperial war effort.[CITATION-41] Men within the church likewise found reasons to view the emperor positively, if a poem by Sophronius, the future patriarch of Jerusalem, praising Phocas\u2019 just nature and a later report noting Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria\u2019s loyalty to the emperor are any indication of contemporary attitudes.[CITATION-42] Rome\u2019s loyalty to the legitimate emperor against a military revolt, even in 610, was, then, in tune with the thoughts of many other imperial subjects, as one would expect from a city with close ties to the eastern Mediterranean.[CITATION-43] Phocas was deposed by the usurper Heraclius in October 610, but the latter\u2019s success did not lead to the golden age his propaganda promised. By the time of Heraclius\u2019 grandson, Constans II, the remarkable successes of the Arab conquests meant that Roman forces no longer controlled Egypt or the Levant.[CITATION-44] Unhelpfully for the war effort, a contemporaneous religious dispute over Christology also shook the empire, leading to the formation of an alliance between papal Rome and a group of Greek monks led by the Palestinian Maximus the Confessor to campaign against the theological pronouncements emanating from Constantinople.[CITATION-45] As the focus in this article will not be on the doctrinal controversy itself, but rather on how what little information Bede provides can be used to clarify the geo-political situation in the 660s, the theological details are not the principal concern here. For convenience\u2019s sake only, the supporters of the Christological stance promoted by Constantinople are identified here as the monotheletes, while their opponents, primarily eastern monks and their papal allies, are termed the anti-monotheletes or dyotheletes, labels which do not entirely capture the frequent shifts in attitudes and terminologies that characterised the doctrinal dispute itself.On the surface, the monothelete controversy was no longer a dangerous issue by the 660s, as the anti-monotheletes had broadly been contained a decade earlier. Their leaders had been exiled to Crimea and the Caucasus on the fringes of the empire, while in Rome a seemingly more pliant pope, Vitalian (657\u201272), was once again in communion with Constantinople.[CITATION-46] Yet despite the end of overt politicking over this Christological dispute, it is still possible to detect how this dissident network continued to evolve over the following decade. The first clue, unexpectedly, comes from England. According to Bede, a Greek monk, Theodore of Tarsus, was chosen by Vitalian in late 667 to become the new metropolitan of Canterbury.[CITATION-47] This has long been recognised as a crucial moment in English history and indeed was framed by Bede as such, with Theodore\u2019s appointment described as the beginning of a golden age.[CITATION-48] Bede\u2019s account of this crucial event nonetheless requires some unpacking, for his narrative of the circumstances of this appointment and Theodore\u2019s journey to England needs to be examined alongside sources written within the empire, particularly in the light of recent revisionist interpretations of the reign of Constans II.Born in Cilicia, Theodore first appears in the extant sources as a probable participant in the Lateran Synod of 649, a defiant council organised by Pope Martin (649\u201354) and Maximus the Confessor to oppose monotheletism.[CITATION-49] While the appearance of a \u2018Theodorus monachus\u2019 among the signatories of this council is only an uncertain indication of Theodore of Tarsus\u2019 affiliation, Pope Agatho\u2019s later reference in 680 to Theodore as a noted expert on this doctrinal issue surely confirms his involvement in 649.[CITATION-50] The future archbishop can thus be identified as a learned anti-monothelete present in Rome and a relatively prominent member of the Greek community in imperial Italy. In recent years, Theodore has also been increasingly cast as a refugee who had fled his homeland due to the wars in the East.[CITATION-51] His eventual appointment to Canterbury was, then, only made possible by the seventh-century \u2018world crisis\u2019, even though the Arab conquests are often said to have had the opposite effect, of breaking the ties that bound the Mediterranean world together.It is worth, however, spending some time revisiting this interpretation, for alternative views are now possible. Above all, it must be noted that we cannot be certain of Theodore\u2019s life before 649, particularly with regard to his arrival in Rome. There were many refugees in the imperial West, but we should be wary of applying this label to all, or indeed any, Greeks present in the city. Among other travellers to Rome in the seventh century, we can find a certain Tychikos, a Greek ex-soldier who allegedly travelled to Rome to study618.[CITATION-52] Since Theodore is plausibly argued to have studied in Antioch and Constantinople on the basis of the surviving, Tychikos\u2019 choice of Rome may imply that the western city would have also been an attractive destination for a learned Cilician seeking a broader education.[CITATION-53] As has recently been discussed by Dennis E. Trout, classicising epigrams composed during and after the tenure of Pope Honorius (625\u201338) further problematise the traditional view of Rome as a \u2018literary backwater\u2019.[CITATION-54] As this circle of poets linked to Honorius was active only a decade before Theodore\u2019s first appearance in the sources, it seems unlikely that the Cilician monk\u2019s training in the East would have been entirely lost on the educated elite in Rome. Similarly at an institutional level, the high standard of learning possible in seventh-century Rome is demonstrated by the continuous use of Latin prose rhythm in official papal letters.[CITATION-55] Since this stylistic feature also appears in epistles written to support Pope Martin\u2019s campaign against monotheletism, Theodore\u2019s early involvement in the controversy and his intellectual background provide further intersections with the presumably well-educated scribes working in the papal chancery.Another participant in the Lateran Synod, Theocharistos, likewise highlights the need to interpret Theodore\u2019s career with more care. Even though he is on the surface indistinguishable from other anti-monothelete Greeks active in the West, Theocharistos is mentioned incidentally in an account of Maximus the Confessor\u2019s Constantinopolitan trial in 655 as the brother of the exarch of Ravenna, presumably Plato (645\u20139).[CITATION-56] Given this familial connection, Theocharistos can hardly have been a refugee who fled westwards out of necessity. Although Theodore of Tarsus does not appear to have possessed any link to the imperial aristocracy, the example of Theocharistos means that we need to be cautious when discussing the future archbishop\u2019s background. Without further evidence, it is perhaps more prudent to consider the uncertainty involved, while at the same time still recognising Theodore\u2019s exceptionally mobile career.Regardless of how Theodore joined the anti-monotheletes, it seems clear that he played a major role in the movement. As Michael Lapidge notes, Theodore probably dwelt among his fellow Cilicians at the monastery of Aquae Salviae, an institution also represented at the Lateran Synod and one which maintained ties to Palestine, where Maximus\u2019 monastic network had originated.[CITATION-57] The later appearance in England of the cult of Gregory the Great following Theodore\u2019s arrival is another indication of the future archbishop\u2019s affinity with the anti-monothelete network, for Gregory also loomed large in other texts composed within this circle, which, at a time when that pope\u2019s fame was not yet assured, is a significant clue to Theodore\u2019s network.[CITATION-58] As we will see, the choice of Theodore as the new head of the English church by Pope Vitalian only confirms this interpretation, but the process reported by Bede was rather convoluted. The pope first selected Hadrian, a learned North African abbot.[CITATION-59] Hadrian refused the pope\u2019s initial offer, proposing an aged monk as an alternative before offering Theodore as a possibility. This account therefore suggests that the Cilician was essentially a candidate of last resort. Bede\u2019s narrative, however, is not without its problems. Significantly, he continues by noting that Hadrian was to be sent along with Theodore to ensure that the Cilician did not introduce anything contrary to the true faith, \u2018in the Greek manner\u2019, to his new home, which is occasionally read as a veiled warning against monotheletism.[CITATION-60] Alternatively, this phrase has been interpreted by Lapidge and Marek Jankowiak to mean that Vitalian was aware of Theodore\u2019s earlier anti-monothelete campaigns and so the reconciliatory pope was wary of provoking conflict with the emperor if he appointed a dissident to Canterbury.[CITATION-61] Both interpretations are problematic, for it seems implausible that Theodore could have been a monothelete sympathiser given his career thus far, or that his excessive zeal for dyotheletism was supposed to be contained by Hadrian, his right-hand man upon their arrival in England.[CITATION-62] If Shaw is correct to suggest that tales from Bede\u2019s former abbot, Benedict Biscop, were at the heart of his narrative, then these discrepancies become partially explicable, for the account we have today represented only what Bede could collate together based on oral traditions and supplementary papal letters, not the full picture of what occurred in Rome in 667.[CITATION-63] Scrutiny of the imperial context for Theodore\u2019s appointment is therefore required and I suggest here that eastern sources indicate a new possible reading for Vitalian\u2019s curious decision: that it was a deliberate choice by the pope at a time of rising tensions with Constantinople. For just as Mellitus returned to England while the empire was in turmoil in 610, the same was the case when Theodore travelled to Canterbury nearly sixty years later. After a brief respite for the empire while the Arab caliphate was consumed by the First Fitna (the civil war of 656\u201261), a new offensive on all fronts was launched by Caliph Mu\u2019awiya in 662.[CITATION-64] Emperor Constans II then moved westwards to Italy to secure the imperial West against this new threat, a move that apparently did not please contemporaries.[CITATION-65] In Constantinople, the two imperial regents refused the emperor\u2019s orders for the empress and their children to be sent to Constans, while within Vitalian\u2019s biography in thethere is also a particularly virulent denunciation of Constans, whose stay in Sicily was allegedly accompanied by unacceptable tax rises for the inhabitants of Italy.[CITATION-66] By the late 660s, the \u2018Mediterranean world war\u2019 between the Romans and the Arabs had become more dire still for the empire, as it is now certain that the First Arab Siege of Constantinople did not last for four years in the 670s, as historians thought for centuries. If we follow Jankowiak\u2019s recent reconstruction, the siege instead took place in 668.[CITATION-67] An alternative reading published in 2016 by Vivien Prigent meanwhile places the siege early in the reign of Constantine IV (668\u201285), perhaps in 669\u201270.[CITATION-68] Regardless of whom we follow for the date of the attack on Constantinople, the sense of crisis within the empire must have been profound, for the preceding Arab offensives had already led to the revolt of a Roman general in Asia Minor in 667, and the next year in July Constans was himself assassinated in Sicily, presumably a result of his seemingly illogical stay in the West while the eastern frontier was in flames.[CITATION-69] Indeed, as a man with dyothelete sympathies, Theodore of Koloneia, appears to have held significant power in Constantinople while the emperor was absent, it is also possible that the emperor\u2019s assassination was partially orchestrated by those who opposed the emperor\u2019s religious policy.[CITATION-70] Since the emperor and his entourage were now based in Italy, the way in which the papacy responded to this crisis is of particular relevance. Although Vitalian is often seen as a pragmatic pope, at least in relation to the monothelete controversy, it is worth bearing in mind that by670 Rome would once again break with Constantinople, with the result that eastern patriarchs attempted to remove Vitalian\u2019s name from patriarchal diptychs.[CITATION-71] Jankowiak attributes this renewed schism to tensions with the archbishop of Ravenna, but, by considering other indications of dissent dating from668, this article argues that anti-monotheletism was no less relevant at this point than it was during Pope Martin and Maximus the Confessor\u2019s campaign two decades earlier, and that Vitalian had reactivated the papacy\u2019s links with dyotheletes amid this new crisis.[CITATION-72] This is perhaps an unexpected shift in position by the accommodating pope of the late 650s, but a consideration of the political context makes this argument rather more compelling. In any case, even if Vitalian had maintained his earlier pragmatic attitude and reopened the monothelete controversy over Ravenna or other disagreements, adopting a strong Christological stance would have remained a politically astute move in the 660s, for it allowed the pope to tap into the anti-monothelete network\u2019s resources for his own ends.Bede\u2019s account of Theodore of Tarsus\u2019 appointment therefore takes on new significance, for in this unique narrative someone with demonstrable anti-monothelete expertise once again emerged as a prominent political figure because of papal machinations. The fact that Theodore of Tarsus was accompanied to England by Hadrian could likewise be another indication of the papacy\u2019s return to dissent, for some historians have interpreted Hadrian\u2019s eventual detainment by a Frankish mayor of the palace as a result of his previous role as an imperial envoy to the Merovingian kingdoms.[CITATION-73] If this was the case, then the abbot\u2019s suggestion to the pope in late 667 of the anti-monothelete Theodore is evidence that yet another servant of Constans II had now turned against him, not long before the emperor\u2019s assassination the following year.A rising wave of discontent in the late 660s would also provide a neat explanation for Vitalian\u2019s delayed choice for Canterbury, for he had known of the request for a new metropolitan since 665/6.[CITATION-74] Indeed, before he selected Theodore, the pope had already sent home the Northumbrian delegation that had travelled to Rome to request a new bishop, adding the unconvincing justification, in a letter to the king of Northumbria, that no suitable candidate had been found due to the long distances involved.[CITATION-75] Although often read in more straightforward terms, such a statement can also be interpreted to be an excuse for the pope\u2019s inaction while he waited for the right opportunity to arise. Whereas in the mid-660s Vitalian could not act unchallenged because of Constans\u2019 physical proximity, by late 667 the empire was embroiled in a new crisis, a crisis that perhaps provided an opening for the pope to appoint a known dissident to an important see loyal to Rome. As Shaw, again, has persuasively argued, the 660s were a time of trouble for the English church, which had been effectively rendered leaderless by plague and infighting, and was thus left open to the direct reassertion of papal influence.[CITATION-76] Who better to fulfil this mission than Theodore, a prominent anti-monothelete with proven alignment with papal interests?Based only on Bede\u2019s words, these suggestions remain somewhat speculative, but evidence for renewed unrest over the monothelete controversy can also be found on the eastern frontiers of the empire, where the seemingly shattered networks of anti-monothelete dissidents re-emerged. Their leader, Maximus the Confessor, had died in 662, but his surviving followers, most prominently Anastasius the Apocrisiarius, received a number of visitors from 664 onwards, which is surely an indicator that the exiles were now once again in contact with their wider following. The first visitor, Stephen, the son of a priest in Jerusalem, travelled to Lazica in the eastern Black Sea region to meet the exiled Anastasius, allegedly preaching his doctrine throughout the regions he passed through and bringing the good news that the church in Jerusalem had now turned against monotheletism, abandoning its previous \u2018heretical\u2019 stance.[CITATION-77] Other sympathisers were more local, as Anastasius was seemingly supported by several imperial officials in his exile, including the \u2018leaders of the Abasgians\u2019, Gregory the patrician and, an anonymous patrician and general of Iberia, and Lebarnikios the patrician of Lazica\u2014all of whom who should have been enforcing imperial orders to isolate these exiles.[CITATION-78] Finally, around 666, we learn that two brothers from Palestine, Theodore Spudaeus and Theodosius of Gangra, visited Crimea and then Lazica to pay their respects to their exiled heroes. By the time the two brothers arrived in Lazica, before August 668, Anastasius was dead, but they nonetheless received his writings and relics thanks to Gregory of Betararous, an abbot from Caucasian Albania\u2014presumably yet another new ally encountered by the dissidents during their exile.[CITATION-79] These isolated mentions of growing support in the region may appear insignificant at first glance, but taken together they do suggest that the exiles\u2019 wider network continued to grow and to campaign for their cause, even after they had been sent to the fringes of the empire.[CITATION-80] Indeed, as Anastasius had once been accused of promoting treason even while he was exiled in Thrace, there is no reason to think that he would have relented once he had been forced eastwards to the Caucasus.[CITATION-81] As a formerand presbyter from Rome, Anastasius is, furthermore, an excellent example of how individuals associated with the papacy continued the fight despite their defeat at earlier show trials.[CITATION-82] Just as with Theodore\u2019s appointment to Canterbury, the re-establishment of contact between individuals in this circle of dissidents took place at an opportune time, for it occurred amid renewed warfare between the empire and the caliphate after 662.[CITATION-83] Given the scale of the conflict, it had had perhaps provided an opportunity for the exiles\u2019 disciples to visit their leaders once again and to persuade local officials to facilitate these communications. There were certainly already sympathisers of the dyothelete cause within the imperial court, as both a certain Gregory the prefect and the general Theodore of Koloneia were highlighted in anti-monothelete sources written in the 650s, and it seems reasonable to suggest that the same would have continued into the 660s.[CITATION-84] These signs of discontent against Constantinople therefore offer a remarkable contemporary parallel to the proposed shift in attitude within the papacy to which Bede bears witness. Not only did an anti-monothelete, Theodore of Tarsus, contemporaneously return to the spotlight in 667, his appointment also took place a decade after the last tangible evidence, from 656/7, for any dissension within the papacy against doctrinal accommodation, thus mirroring the initial silence in the sources and then the rebuilding of Anastasius\u2019 network in the Caucasus.[CITATION-85] Similar clues can even be found in the post-Roman West. The most striking is an excursus on the sufferings of the anti-monothelete Pope Martin included in the, a celebration of a Frankish bishop active in the mid-seventh century.[CITATION-86] The dating of the first recension of the Merovingian text composed by Eligius\u2019 friend, Bishop Audoin of Rouen, cannot, admittedly, be determined with any certainty. Clemens Bayer suggests that it was written in 660\u2013673/684, with the latter being the broad date-range mooted for the second phase of composition, while Walter Berschin favours 675\u201380.[CITATION-87] Nonetheless, it is surely significant that the hagiographer preceded the Martin digression with the remarkable statement that \u2018we know a certain brother coming from the eastern parts\u2019 who had witnessed all the deeds described in the following account.[CITATION-88] This passage thus raises the tantalising possibility that an eastern anti-monothelete, who allegedly accompanied Martin to Constantinople and then in his exile, had somehow arrived in Merovingian Gaul, a journey across borders similar to that of travellers from caliphal Palestine to the imperial Caucasus.[CITATION-89] Given the flurry of dyothelete movements in the late 660s, as well as the proposed shift in orientation by Vitalian, the final years of Constans\u2019 reign provides a plausible context for the diffusion of such pro-Martin propaganda. Even if this report was ultimately produced in the 670s instead of the 660s, it still speaks for the mobility of committed anti-monotheletes\u2014and their persistence at a time when doctrinal dissent is otherwise largely invisible in the sources.[CITATION-90] In any case, there are other telltale hints of Merovingian interest in this seemingly very imperial dispute, for Eligius and Audoin\u2019s awareness of the monothelete controversy and their earlier sympathies for Pope Martin\u2019s anti-monothelete campaign in 649 have now been firmly established.[CITATION-91] These sentiments, moreover, mesh particularly well with the common pro-papal attitude within their wider familial and monastic network, all of which provides further contextual support for an anonymous easterner\u2019s encounter with Audoin.[CITATION-92] Theodore of Tarsus\u2019 road to Canterbury reinforces this interpretation, for according to Bede he and his companion Hadrian encountered on the way three Frankish bishops, Emmo of Sens, Faro of Meaux and Agilbert of Paris, who were bound together by friendship and familial ties to the aforementioned Audoin and Eligius.[CITATION-93] Of course, political alignments are not decided simply by such links, but in one case we can be relatively confident, for we possess other corroborative reports: Agilbert was not only one of Audoin\u2019s relatives, but he was also a pro-Roman advocate at the Northumbrian Synod of Whitby in 664 and a mentor to the pre-eminent, or at least the loudest, Romanophile in Northumbria, Wilfrid of York.[CITATION-94] The same pattern of co-operation between Theodore and known advocates of Roman doctrinal positions continued in England, for it was surely not a coincidence that when Theodore finally arrived, Wilfrid\u2019s fortunes revived. Typically for this troublesome advocate of papal primacy, Wilfrid was then in internal exile, having lost his position as bishop of Northumbria due to lack of royal favour.[CITATION-95] Upon his arrival, Theodore apparently amicably moved the existing bishop to a seat elsewhere, in order to replace him with Wilfrid\u2014a convenient story that presumably obscured the political dealings that lay behind such a transfer.[CITATION-96] At the very least, we can presume that Theodore was the crucial figure in the machinations leading up to this pro-Roman bishop\u2019s restoration.Given the pro-Roman sympathies evident in Gaul and England, the Frankish reception in 668 of a papal appointee, or at the very least the welcome provided by Agilbert, should be seen as a move that reaffirmed Theodore of Tarsus and his host\u2019s common support for the papacy. The same reception is also yet another indication that Theodore\u2019s appointment was one aligned with contemporary papal thinking on doctrinal matters, and that Bede\u2019s strange assertion that the pope was worried about Theodore\u2019s eastern customs is likely the result of the historian\u2019s own prejudice rather than a statement of fact.[CITATION-97] Papal officials had, after all, worked closely with Greek monks over the previous decades and it would have been an odd move for Vitalian to display such scepticism when eastern support was surely required if the papacy was ever to triumph in this doctrinal dispute.[CITATION-98] Instead, it seems more likely that Vitalian chose a monk with demonstrable loyalty to Rome for a seat uniquely connected to the papacy. Indeed, as Theodore\u2019s expertise against monotheletism was still remembered in Rome more than a decade later, when Pope Agatho asked the Cilician to return to the empire on the eve of the Third Council of Constantinople (680\u201281), Theodore can hardly have been an isolated figure sent to Canterbury to be ignored.[CITATION-99] By considering Bede\u2019s words alongside evidence from the Roman Empire and Frankish Gaul, particularly with the knowledge that Vitalian would later break with Constantinople670, we can arrive at the more persuasive reconstruction that there were indeed anti-monothelete forces at work in 667. However, they were not directed at Theodore of Tarsus, as Bede implied, but instead at Constans, for the crisis at the end of the emperor\u2019s reign had reignited anti-monothelete activism in both the Caucasus and Rome.The need to approach Bede\u2019s narrative through a transregional lens can be illustrated also by the experiences of Theodore\u2019s companion Hadrian. In Bede\u2019s narrative of the two men\u2019s journey to England, the North African abbot was detained by Ebroin, the mayor of the palace in the kingdom of Neustria\u2013Burgundy, who allegedly feared a plot involving the emperor and unnamed kings in Britain; an understandable concern if Hadrian was indeed an ex-imperial ambassador to Gaul.[CITATION-100] Although there is little else to say about this obscure event, Ebroin\u2019s alleged paranoia over the long reach of Roman diplomacy certainly would have been justified and is increasingly recognised as such: Constans was based in Italy and had conducted campaigns against the Lombards and the Slavs in the 660s, meaning that post-Roman kingdoms were inevitably drawn into the calculations of the emperor.[CITATION-101] As the Frankishattributed to Fredegar, written660 in Burgundy, portrayed Constans II positively, there is good reason to think that the kingdom of Neustria\u2013Burgundy was the target of imperial diplomacy (or at least propaganda), despite the ongoing monothelete controversy.[CITATION-102] In a similar manner, it has been suggested that a Frankish attack on the Lombards in 660\u201363 was linked to a renewed Merovingian\u2013Roman alliance.[CITATION-103] More recently, Stefan Esders has made the tempting suggestion that the martyrdom of Bishop Aunemundus of Lyons, who was apparently murdered partly due to his foreign ties661/2, can also be better understood within the same context of intensifying Frankish ties with the Mediterranean.[CITATION-104] Events following Hadrian\u2019s arrival in Gaul only further justify Ebroin\u2019s suspicions of a party travelling from imperial Rome. According to Michael the Syrian, a much later author but one who nonetheless had access to earlier texts, after Constans II\u2019s death in 668, the emperor\u2019s sons ventured to \u2018Gaul and Italy\u2019 to subdue the peoples of the West, an assertion which could imply that Constantine IV and his brothers did indeed have some dealings with the Merovingian kingdoms.[CITATION-105] The contemporaneous siege of Constantinople, whether it took place in 668 or 669\u201270, was likewise concluded by the visit of foreign signatories arriving to celebrate the imperial victory\u2014and which featured, according to the later historian Theophanes the Confessor, ambassadors from the \u2018princes of the western nations\u2019.[CITATION-106] As the Lombard leaders have already been mentioned in this passage, this suggests that the envoys were sent from Gaul, Spain, or Britain, with the Merovingian Franks being the most likely given their history of diplomacy with the empire.[CITATION-107] Amid these dramatic events, Ebroin can surely be forgiven for thinking that a North African abbot travelling to Canterbury, sent from a city integral to the empire and who had already travelled to Gaul twice, was an agent of Constantinople. Levison was then correct to note in 1946 that although Bede\u2019s story of a possible imperial diplomatic mission beyond Gaul may seem absurd to some modern readers, it nonetheless remains a striking indication of England\u2019s connections to the wider world.[CITATION-108] Intriguingly, almost simultaneously on the other side of Eurasia, a Roman embassy also reached the court of the Chinese emperor in 667. An earlier visit was recorded in 643 and was in fact the first to reach China for nearly two centuries, making these mid-seventh century missions significant events in their own right.[CITATION-109] The mooted causes for this renewed contact with China range from an attempt to co-operate with the Tang dynasty against the rising caliphate to the more mundane explanation that some visits only aimed to announce the accession of new emperors, much like the Romans\u2019 previous relationship with the now-defunct Persian Empire.[CITATION-110] In either case, as Constantinople had maintained an active \u2018Eurasian policy\u2019 towards central Asia over the previous century, similarly ambitious diplomatic initiatives by Constans II are hardly out of place.[CITATION-111] More research is still needed to ascertain the precise nature of the empire\u2019s relationship with China, but the mere presence of evidence for missions to the East and clues to the empire\u2019s contact with the Merovingian Franks, with the implication that a link to England was not seen as unrealistic in Gaul, is significant in itself. The fact that this can be identified for the 660s, when the military crisis within the empire was seemingly at its greatest, is certainly suggestive of how sophisticated imperial foreign policy remained. At the very least, if Constantinople was able to make contact with China, contemporary Frankish fears of an imperial embassy to England become a rather less far-fetched prospect. This is of course a rare example of how viewing evidence from a transregional perspective can helpfully clarify the interconnectedness of geo-political events in Late Antiquity, but it is useful nonetheless and demonstrates the potential for new interpretations when eastern sources are read alongside Bede. The empire\u2019s crises in the East did not necessarily mean that it would abandon the West, and there is still a need to integrate the Latin and Greek narratives together to reach a more nuanced picture of the Mediterranean world. Theodore of Tarsus and Hadrian of Canterbury are well-known figures to historians of early medieval England, but by digging deeper into imperial history, Bede\u2019s account takes on greater importance, for his words provide remarkable parallels to the political and diplomatic intrigues consuming the final years of Constans II. Indeed, just as it was during the reign of Phocas, the papacy emerges as an active agent in these events\u2014not a distant western institution removed from Constantinople\u2019s eastern woes.The example of the third emperor whose final days left their echoes in Bede, Justinian II, offers further support for this interpretation. This clue is found in Bede\u2019s, composed725 as part of his, a text that has received less attention from historians than the, perhaps because many of its entries were directly taken from the. On the topic of Justinian II, however, Bede provides additional information that can be fruitfully compared to the Greek sources. Some studies of this emperor have already utilised Bede\u2019s, but the implication of the Northumbrian having access to this information has yet to be fully considered, particularly in the light of the evidence raised earlier in this article.[CITATION-112] Justinian II had first been overthrown and forced into exile in 695, but he was restored to the throne in 705, allegedly then hunting down all those who had wronged him over the previous decade. This reign of terror was described vividly by the contemporary Trajan the Patrician, who wrote a now-lostthat was incorporated into later histories by Nicephorus (780s), Theophanes the Confessor (810\u201214), and George the Monk (846/847), as seen in the pool of common material shared by all three sources.[CITATION-113] The extent of Trajan\u2019s work is still disputed, with recent arguments maintaining that it extended to around 716, or even 720, but for the purposes of this paper its original end-point is of relatively little importance, as the focus is on his account of what happened before 711, the year Justinian was deposed for the second, and final, time.[CITATION-114] Although Trajan is a contemporary witness to the end of Justinian\u2019s reign, his words should also be used with care. As Stephanie Forrest has argued recently, the chronicler twisted recent history to suit his own needs, in particular contrasting the \u2018bad\u2019 emperor Justinian with his father, the \u2018good\u2019 emperor Constantine IV.[CITATION-115] Or, in James Howard-Johnston\u2019s interpretation, the lost source is better seen as a political memoir, in which we can detect the very personal animosity Trajan had towards his emperor.[CITATION-116] In their broad strokes, the Greek sources describe first Justinian\u2019s restoration, after which he blinded Callinicus, the patriarch of Constantinople, and sent him to Rome.[CITATION-117] The next relevant passages concern Justinian\u2019s fall from power. To punish the people of Cherson for their treason when he was in exile, Justinian sent multiple naval expeditions to Crimea. According to Theophanes, the most detailed of the sources using Trajan\u2019s, the first fleet executed the entire population of Cherson apart from the children; during the fleet\u2019s return journey it was then hit by a storm\u2014leading to the death of 73,000 men. Undeterred, Justinian mustered another fleet to punish the province further, which finally provoked the inhabitants of Cherson to revolt. An exile, Philippicus, was acclaimed as the new emperor by both rebels and defectors from the imperial army, who afterwards sailed to Constantinople. Justinian\u2019s ensuing downfall was swift, as he was abandoned by his soldiers and beheaded.[CITATION-118] Much of this is certainly polemical exaggeration, particularly the absurd account of Justinian repeatedly sending fleets to murder his subjects. However, the sole surviving contemporary Greek account, a brief note written by Agathon the Deacon after 713, provides only the location of Justinian\u2019s death and a vague report that expeditions to Cherson led to Philippicus\u2019 revolt.[CITATION-119] As a result, Byzantinists are generally reliant on the words of those who adapted Trajan the Patrician\u2019s retelling of the usurper\u2019s rise to power.[CITATION-120] It is fortunate, then, that Bede\u2019s entry for Justinian II bears striking parallels with the Greek narrative.[CITATION-121] In both Bede\u2019sand Greek histories, Patriarch Callinicus was blinded and exiled to Rome, while one Cyrus was chosen as his replacement. This is where the traditions appear to differ. In Greek sources, Cyrus was at once a priest, a monk, and a hermit from Amastris in northern Anatolia, while Bede describes Cyrus as an abbot from Pontus (\u2018qui erat abbas in Ponto\u2019).[CITATION-122] For Constance Head, Bede\u2019s account is to be preferred, since in her interpretation the word \u2018Pontus\u2019 referred to the Crimean peninsula; as Bede also placed Justinian\u2019s exile in \u2018Pontus\u2019, it would suggest that the Greek sources erred on Cyrus\u2019 origins.[CITATION-123] However, as Bede elsewhere defined the word to mean the broad region around the Black Sea, we can easily account for this apparent disparity.[CITATION-124] Bede\u2019s account, both of Justinian being exiled to Pontus and of Cyrus originating in Pontus, therefore matches the Greek sources, for Amastris is indeed a city on the southern coast of the Black Sea. Nor is Bede\u2019s grant of the title of \u2018abbas\u2019 to Cyrus necessarily contradictory to Greek accounts, for, given his monastic status, a higher position for the future patriarch, one neglected by anti-Justinianic sources, is hardly implausible. Moreover, as there is one instance of a contemporary Latin translation that equated \u2018abbas\u2019 with the Greek word \u2018\u1f00\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03c2\u2019, even though the Greek term is used as a term of respect and not a reference to the office of an abbot, the same misunderstanding may have led Bede or his source astray.[CITATION-125] Eastern sources further report that Cyrus had predicted Justinian\u2019s second reign during the emperor\u2019s exile, and that the fulfilment of this prediction was the reason for the emperor\u2019s reward to Cyrus of the patriarchate.[CITATION-126] This is perhaps another implicit criticism of Justinian, since, in the Council in Trullo convened by the emperor in 691\u20132, one canon in particular condemned attempts to predict the future.[CITATION-127] A tale in which Justinian later rewards his chosen patriarch for the practice was therefore another suitable means for Trajan the Patrician to blacken his antagonist\u2019s name.[CITATION-128] Bede, on the other hand, only noted that the office was granted due to unspecified aid given by Cyrus to the exiled emperor.[CITATION-129] Given Justinian\u2019s negative reputation in later sources, the lack of supernatural involvement in the Bedan narrative is another indication that this account should be taken more seriously.The remainder of Justinian\u2019s reign was allegedly a bloody one, culminating in his overthrow in 711. In Bede\u2019s telling, Justinian sought to arrest Philippicus for an unknown reason; the army then betrayed Justinian and returned to defeat him. Most surprisingly, Bede noted the role played by a pope, who allegedly forbade Justinian from sending the army to seize Philippicus.[CITATION-130] This was surely Pope Constantine (708\u201315), who had left Rome in October 710 to visit Constantinople and who secured a personal meeting with Justinian.[CITATION-131] As Constantine returned to Rome in October 711, he had stayed for a substantial amount of time in the East and so would have been in the right place to give advice when unrest in Cherson began in the summer of 711.[CITATION-132] Unfortunately we do not possess any other record of the issues the emperor discussed with the pope, aside from the\u2019 rather allusive comment that Justinian confirmed certain privileges, but it is probable that the two men reached some sort of agreement over ecclesiastical policy\u2014a reconciliation that may have given the pope sufficient leeway to attempt to influence the turbulent emperor.[CITATION-133] It is impossible to determine precisely what Constantine\u2019s advice entailed or what it suggests about the pope\u2019s attitudes towards the emperor. Perhaps Bede\u2019s original source expressed a more negative opinion of Justinian, meaning that this report may have been an attempt to distance the pope from the emperor\u2019s misjudgements; equally it could have been a narrative strategy to demonstrate Constantine\u2019s wisdom when compared to the impetuous Justinian. Interestingly, unlike the, which provided a seemingly convivial account of the emperor\u2019s dealings with the pope, a hint of reproach can be detected in Bede\u2019s, for Justinian was said to have \u2018ordered\u2019 the pope to perform Mass for him, nor was the ruler described as \u2018the most Christian and orthodox emperor\u2019 as in Constantine\u2019s biography.[CITATION-134] This difference may have been the result of Bede\u2019s own editorial intervention, for in the text as a whole emperors were increasingly sidelined in favour of the bishops of Rome, and the same ends could have been achieved by minimising Justinian\u2019s virtues.[CITATION-135] More speculatively, the chronicler\u2019s words could also suggest that the pope had attempted to defend Philippicus from Justinian\u2019s punishment. Seen with the benefit of hindsight, this would have been an unusual decision for the pope, as Philippicus would later restore monotheletism as imperial \u2018orthodoxy\u2019 and consequently has a particularly poor image in the.[CITATION-136] We must therefore also consider the possibility that Bede\u2019s original source was either favourable to Philippicus or was written before his \u2018heresy\u2019 became widely known. Indeed, this passage is a possible indication that Bede\u2019s information here was not ultimately derived from a later version of the. In Rosamond McKitterick\u2019s persuasive reconstruction of the text\u2019s origins, papal biographies up to and including that of Constantine combined to affirm Rome\u2019s \u2018orthodoxy\u2019 against imperial interference, with Constantine\u2019s triumphal visit to the East in particular being a culmination of the arguments laid out in previous.[CITATION-137] An ambiguous statement that Constantine did not wish for the \u2018heretical\u2019 Philippicus to be arrested and the simple fact that the pope had failed to persuade Justinian to relent would therefore be at odds with the\u2019 overall message, meaning that Bede\u2019s source here is probably a separate composition from the final version of Constantine\u2019s biography.It is notable, then, that, according to the, there was simmering unrest in Rome between supporters of the anti-monothelete faction and a pro-Philippicus group led by a certain Peter, who had sought to acquire the dukedom of Rome. The two sides came to blows on the Via Sacra and resulted in over sixty casualties, which surely must be read as an indication of some residual loyalties to the new emperor, regardless of his doctrinal stance.[CITATION-138] Rome, and even the papacy itself, was no stranger to accepting doctrinal compromises in the seventh century, so we certainly should not assume that the city stood united against monotheletism a few decades later.[CITATION-139] Furthermore, this conflict provides a remarkable parallel with the little we know of Philippicus\u2019 reign in the East, as the usurper did apparently have supporters in Constantinople and was even recorded in one later source as \u2018the gentle\u2019, despite his enforcement of monotheletism.[CITATION-140] A plausible origin for Bede\u2019s information, if only a tentative one, would thus be a text written while Rome was still welcoming the rise of Philippicus, before the pope\u2019s about-turn once the emperor\u2019s monothelete tendencies became obvious, or a source that chose to present recent history a little differently from the official papal narrative. While it is well known that a copy of the, dating to the early pontificate of Gregory II (715\u201231) and which included a partial biography of the incumbent pope, was one of Bede\u2019s sources, this curious section on Justinian and Philippicus in Bede\u2019sraises the interesting possibility that an earlier recension of Constantine\u2019s biography, also written while the pope was still alive, was accessible to Bede as well.[CITATION-141] More mundanely, it remains possible that this information had reached Northumbria via a text written independently of the, and that Bede had creatively mixed together the sources at his disposal to tone down Justinian\u2019s more positive image in Constantine\u2019s biography. In the latter case, we can then link Bede\u2019s source also to later entries in the, as his account of Philippicus\u2019 blinding, the second Arab siege of Constantinople (717\u201218) and the translation of St Augustine of Hippo\u2019s relics to Pavia likewise differed from material in the, the basis for the majority of Bede\u2019s eighth-century narratives.[CITATION-142] At the very least, as Bede\u2019s notices on Philippicus\u2019 blinding and the involvement of the Bulgars during the Arab siege are unique among surviving Latin texts, it remains tempting to suggest that the Northumbrian possessed a source with a keen interest in Constantinopolitan events, thus providing a plausible explanation for the inclusion of the background to Philippicus\u2019 revolt earlier in the.[CITATION-143] These details were, of course, of secondary importance for the scribes behind the authorised version of the, which made note of eastern events only to further bolster the case for papal pre-eminence.[CITATION-144] Bede\u2019s following statement on the battle between Justinian and Philippicus reaffirms the reliability of his imperial source(s). The Northumbrian placed the confrontation twelve miles away from Constantinople, while the Greek sources report that the emperor met his demise at Damatrys, which is indeed a location close to the capital.[CITATION-145] As before, Bede also provides a more plausible narrative. According to the Greek sources following Trajan the Patrician, the entirety of Justinian\u2019s army abandoned him, perhaps due to an offer of immunity from the rebels. No battle was recorded.[CITATION-146] An actual battle between the loyalists and the rebels, as suggested by Bede\u2019s usage of \u2018pugnavit\u2019, seems to be more probable, as Trajan\u2019s obviously polemical account, in which Justinian cared for no one and was left to fend for himself in return, should be read with caution.[CITATION-147] If Justinian is regarded instead as more human than monster, Bede\u2019s account is surely to be preferred.One coda remains to be considered: the fate of Cyrus, Justinian\u2019s chosen candidate for the patriarchate of Constantinople. According to Bede, Philippicus removed the patriarch and \u2018ordered him to return to Pontus to govern his monastery\u2019.[CITATION-148] This runs contrary to the Greek sources, which suggest that Cyrus was instead confined within the Chora monastery in Constantinople itself.[CITATION-149] In this particular case, it is more prudent to rely on eastern texts, for Cyrus was eventually commemorated in the Chora monastery, which is a tangible clue to the Greek accounts\u2019 veracity.[CITATION-150] However, if we follow the tentative suggestion above that Bede\u2019s source was a text from Rome kinder to Philippicus than many of his contemporaries, then the Northumbrian narrative is perhaps the result of the original author\u2019s prejudices, or more simply the limited knowledge in Rome of Cyrus\u2019 eventual fate. Last but not least, as Van Dieten noted in 1972, it remains possible, if admittedly unlikely, that Cyrus\u2019 forced return to Pontus and confinement in Constantinople were both episodes in the patriarch\u2019s career after Justinian\u2019s death, but that they were condensed (or reworked) by Bede in such a way that thenoted only the patriarch\u2019s return to his abbacy.[CITATION-151] Despite this final reservation, Bede\u2019sstill provides Byzantinists with a sound guide to Justinian\u2019s second reign, corroborating, adding to, and, in two instances, providing plausible alternatives to the available Greek accounts. Moreover, it must be emphasised again that Bede\u2019sis one of the earliest written sources available. Alongside the Roman edition of theand the brief note of Agathon the Deacon, the Bedan narrative is one of just three surviving near-contemporary accounts detailing Justinian\u2019s otherwise murky second reign. Of these sources, only Bede recounted the fate of Patriarch Callinicus of Constantinople and the circumstances of Philippicus\u2019 revolt, which is particularly notable since hiswas written well before the first surviving Greek historical text to describe the same events, Nicephorus\u2019, which was probably composed in the 780s. Bede should therefore be given significant weight when evaluating Justinian\u2019s reign, for he wrote only fourteen years after the emperor\u2019s death, providing information that is both reliable and untainted by personal animosity towards the emperor, similarly to the examples of Phocas and Constans II discussed above. Despite Northumbria\u2019s distance from the Roman Empire, it is apparent that knowledge of the Greek East had filtered into Bede\u2019s immediate environs, making this unlikely source a valuable aid for Byzantinists today.This conclusion would not have surprised Bede, as he was certainly aware of the much larger world he chronicled in his writings, if only because he interpreted history through a Christian framework. The same would have been true for the papacy, as it remained a part of the Roman Empire and the bishops of Rome would have seen events through an imperial lens. As discussed in this article, Boniface IV, like his loyal predecessors, was apparently a supporter of Phocas even in 610, while Vitalian appears to have been an astute intriguer amid the turmoil of the 660s. Half a century later, Constantine was no different and is noted by Bede as having attempted to influence Justinian\u2019s arrest of Philippicus. From this perspective, little had changed in the century between Boniface and Constantine, despite the intervening monothelete controversy. Rome would eventually break away from the empire later in the eighth century, but it would be ahistorical to assume that it had already become estranged from the Greek East.The scope of this article is restricted largely to the historical information provided by Bede, and the three examples discussed here all deal exclusively with political history at the highest level, but this is of course far from the only approach. A comprehensive investigation of Bede\u2019s entire corpus, particularly his exegesis, will reveal still more of his knowledge of and connections to the wider world. The fact that Bede had relatively up-to-date information on the East is, for instance, clearly seen in Peter Darby\u2019s analysis of Bede\u2019s commentary on the Temple of Solomon, as it suggests that the Northumbrian was aware of the very early stages of iconoclast controversy within the empire and wrote his commentary to reaffirm his agreement with Rome.[CITATION-152] But even with the traditional focus on emperors and their deeds adopted here, this article has nonetheless demonstrated the value of such a transregional approach, and of reading closely Bede\u2019s words alongside the available evidence from the Roman Empire, when reconstructing events in Rome and Constantinople. A full account of Britain\u2019s connections to the Mediterranean world remains to be written, but it nonetheless seems clear that Bede and his networks were, almost inevitably, part of a vast interconnected Eurasian world at the end of Late Antiquity.In his own most dramatic statements, Bede placed Britain firmly within a common Christian community, one that included the Mediterranean and extended beyond Europe, as seen in the appeal to common practices in Africa and Asia from his description of the Synod of Whitby, as well as his emphasis on the martyr Anastasius the Persian and the influence of Theodore of Tarsus.[CITATION-153] Bede and his native Northumbria were indeed situated at \u2018the edge of the world\u2019, but it is worth remembering that they were still a part of it, and Bede\u2019s words were, by necessity, shaped also by the dramatic events that defined imperial history in the seventh and eighth centuries. This is surely a useful reminder that at the end of Late Antiquity, when the Roman Empire and Western Europe seemingly embarked on very different courses, it is still important to take into account the persistent mobility of both people and ideas, even between places as far apart as Constantinople and Northumbria.",
