    "article": "It is common knowledge that, under the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, economic inequality and poverty in the United Kingdom rose dramatically, but it is often overlooked that during the 1980s knowledge about movements in poverty and inequality was much less certain and was subject to political battles over statistical policies, measurements and figures. This article connects the historiography on Thatcherism to the growing scholarship on the politics of statistics. Based on recently declassified government records and other archival and published sources, it explores government interventions in official statistics and their impact on public discourse on issues of economic inequality. The Thatcher government endeavoured to transform the social-democratic knowledge regime inherited from the 1970s by cutting back existing statistical series on income and wealth distribution and by gearing the low income statistics towards the concept of absolute poverty, as favoured by the New Right. Moreover, the government made extensive use of statistical artefacts for government public relations purposes, including controversial claims about substantial rises in the real incomes of the poorest under Thatcher. The article traces how ministers and civil servants used statistical knowledge to promote narratives about the success of Thatcher\u2019s policies and the trickle-down effect, complementing recent research about government public relations and Thatcherite efforts to recast social discourse. It argues that knowledge politics were employed to marginalise issues of economic inequality and to defuse opposition against market-driven reforms.Under the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, economic inequality and poverty in the United Kingdom rose dramatically to high levels that have remained one of the lasting legacies of Thatcherism, with far-reaching implications for social cohesion and political culture in Britain. Present-day textbooks usually present this historical fact as uncontroversial and rely on undisputed statistics for proof; but it is often overlooked that in the 1980s knowledge about rates of poverty and inequality was much less certain and was subject to political battles over statistical policies, measurements and figures.[CITATION-1] Many of the controversies were associated with government interventions in its own statistical system: the government reduced the production of established statistical series on income and wealth distribution and introduced new statistical measures in concerted attempts to steer the debate on poverty away from relativist measures and overall inequality. Moreover, the government made extensive use of statistical artefacts for government public relations purposes. In 1988, a new statistical series produced the striking finding that the poorest 10 per cent of the population had enjoyed above average increases in real incomes of 8.3 per cent under Thatcher; subsequently, this figure became the new cornerstone of government narratives about the success of Thatcher\u2019s policies and the \u2018trickle-down\u2019 effect. Up until her resignation in 1990, Thatcher relied on this statistic to maintain that even the poorest were benefiting from the \u2018massive rise in our living standards\u2019.[CITATION-2] However, the statistic was riddled with errors, some of which never became public knowledge, as this article will show. It was not until after Thatcher\u2019s resignation that more reliable figures became available: in the early and mid-1990s, independent and official analyses concurred that the bottom 10 per cent had in fact experienced losses in real incomes (after housing costs) of up to 14 per cent under Thatcher.[CITATION-3] This was not entirely surprising. From the start of the Thatcher period, the statistical policies of the government had prompted accusations of \u2018fiddling with the figures\u2019.[CITATION-4] Some of the themes of this article were thus already familiar to contemporaries, who witnessed one of the most heated and prolonged public debates about the integrity of government statistics in modern British history. But a more nuanced picture of government practices and communication strategies in the management of statistical knowledge about economic inequality is now emerging from recently declassified government records from the 1980s and 1990s.This article connects the historiography of Thatcherism to the growing body of scholarship on the politics of statistics. The interdisciplinary and international scholarship on the history of statistics and processes of quantification conceptualises statistics as social constructs which shape, and are shaped by, society and the world around it.[CITATION-5] In order to understand the genealogies of these constructs, Alain Desrosi\u00e8res has suggested that scholars concentrate their efforts on opening the apparently impenetrable \u2018black boxes\u2019 of statistics. In the twentieth century, most of these constructs were designed by the state as the principal producer of statistical knowledge, but few scholars have tapped into the vast archives of statistical offices and users in government,[CITATION-6] and existing research on government statistics has concentrated mainly on economic and demographic statistics.[CITATION-7] This article attempts to open the black boxes of poverty and income statistics in the United Kingdom during the 1980s and early 1990s, with a particular focus on the low income statistics produced by the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS).[CITATION-8] This requires probing deeply into the machinery of government, down to the lower levels of the civil service.[CITATION-9] Focusing on these spaces reveals the ways in which statistics were constructed and communicated to the public; who was involved in their production; and which political contexts and considerations influenced their making. At the same time, it sheds new light on working relations between civil servants and government ministers under Thatcher.[CITATION-10] As a micro-level study about the construction of government statistics, it also makes a methodological contribution to the growing interdisciplinary field of research on poverty and inequality knowledge.[CITATION-11] Opening the black boxes of government statistics reveals the decision-making processes and power implications in the production of statistical knowledge. The entanglements of knowledge and power in the making of statistics have been the subject of a rich literature that analyses how numbers gained a near total hold of the public sphere by the late twentieth century, and how processes of quantification pervade the everyday lives of citizen-consumers and shape their subjectivities.[CITATION-12] Government statistics, in particular, have been described as a \u2018part of the technology of power in a modern state\u2019.[CITATION-13] A well-researched example is the system of national accounts, which was imposed on the world after 1945 and was inextricably intertwined with the establishment of political economies fixated on economic growth and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).[CITATION-14] The history of GDP exemplifies the presentational power of a single number: the ubiquity of statistical key indicators has become a central feature of modern political culture, and governments, political parties and other actors have developed techniques to use or spin big numbers to advance their interests.[CITATION-15] This article analyses how the Thatcher administration created and promoted the measure of income growth in the bottom decile as a big number, with official poverty statistics used as a performance indicator for the success of the government\u2019s social and economic policies.The government\u2019s ability to shape and weaponise official statistics depended on its dominant position in this particular epistemic field, one that it sought to defend against challenges from critics, academic experts, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international organisations.[CITATION-16] Interactions between the government and various non-governmental as well as intergovernmental actors were of fundamental importance in shaping the field. In order to explore the dynamic power relations and the social organisation of knowledge production in this specific area, the present analysis relies on the sociological concept of \u2018knowledge regimes\u2019, defined as stabilised configurations of structured practices, norms, and hierarchies of authority in a specific field of knowledge.[CITATION-17] A related analytical term is the concept of \u2018knowledge politics\u2019, which describes political efforts aimed at the stabilisation, governance, or transformation of a given knowledge regime. Looking through this prism, the article will argue that the Thatcher government made changes to practices and institutional arrangements in the production of statistics on poverty and inequality that amounted to knowledge politics, designed to alter the existing knowledge regime. The same logic drove the response from academic experts, opposition politicians and NGOs that eventually broke the government\u2019s monopoly on the poverty figures in 1990/1991\u2014a milestone in the transition to the present-day knowledge regime. As these analytical concepts have rarely been tested in empirical studies, this article also seeks to develop the methodological toolkit of the history of knowledge as an emerging sub-discipline.[CITATION-18] Shedding new light on the political battles over statistical knowledge under Thatcher complements recent research about the government\u2019s public relations strategies and Thatcherite efforts to reframe public discourse on society, class and welfare.[CITATION-19] As Jon Lawrence and Florence Sutcliffe-Braithwaite have demonstrated, Thatcher and her followers strove to convince society of their social vision: the imaginary of a classless political constituency of \u2018ordinary people\u2019 who shared the conservative values associated with the \u2018enterprise economy\u2019. Their anti-class message was reinforced by knowledge politics in the form of attacks on sociological class analysis and its public funding.[CITATION-20] The knowledge politics described in this article were part and parcel of this broader strategy to minimise public discourse on social class divisions. It was not only driven by senior party figures, Conservative Party organisations or neo-liberal think tanks, but also by the state bureaucracy. As Jim Tomlinson has demonstrated, British governments have long employed public relations strategies with a view to educating the general public and winning support for their social and economic policies.[CITATION-21] Government ministers and civil servants constructed and disseminated political narratives, which were interwoven with constructed knowledge and statistical artefacts, sometimes in manipulative ways, as in the well-known case of the unemployment statistics under Thatcher.[CITATION-22] During the Thatcher years, government ministers and officials found themselves under pressure to defuse opposition to market-driven reforms and to burnish the government\u2019s social credentials.[CITATION-23] This article will analyse how the Thatcher administration used \u2018government propaganda\u2019 (Tomlinson) to marginalise economic inequality as a political issue and to legitimise the Thatcherite project by promoting the narrative of the trickle-down effect.An understanding of government propaganda under Thatcher also contributes to recent discussions about political thought in the Conservative Party and \u2018Thatcherism\u2019 as an analytical category. Historians have called for fewer Thatcher-centric analyses and cautioned against the blanket labelling of policies and developments during the 1980s as \u2018neo-liberal\u2019 or \u2018Thatcherite\u2019.[CITATION-24] This article decentres Thatcher in that it puts the spotlight on her ministers and civil servants, and it places the Thatcher years, between 1979 and 1990, in a wider chronological context. However, it reaffirms Thatcherite ideology as an analytical category with respect to the significance of the political philosophy of inequality as a central tenet of Conservative thinking. Conservatives of all factions endorsed inequality and rejected egalitarianism as a matter of principle, but within this consensus the proponents of the New Right held markedly more radical views than One Nation Tories or traditional liberals.[CITATION-25] They engineered a distinctive anti-egalitarian discourse that mythologised \u2018wealth creators\u2019 and the trickle-down effect, while blaming poverty on individual failure and denying any structural explanations. Furthermore, the New Right rejected the concept of relative poverty, which had been introduced to the academic and political debate in the United Kingdom through the scholarly work of Peter Townsend, Brian Abel-Smith and others during the 1960s.[CITATION-26] This \u2018rediscovery of poverty\u2019 had established the view that poverty should be conceptualised and measured in relation to living standards in society as a whole, a principle that was accepted by One Nation Conservatives throughout the 1980s and beyond, while the New Right insisted on the concept of absolute poverty, where the poverty threshold was defined by a subsistence minimum with no regard for relativities. While the intellectual history of these distinctions in Conservative thought has been well researched, less attention has been paid to the means by which New Right ideas about inequality and poverty were implemented by the state bureaucracy. This article will offer a detailed account of the Thatcher government\u2019s project to abandon the concept of relative poverty as a guiding principle in the construction of official poverty statistics and to gear them towards the concept of absolute poverty.The government\u2019s management of official statistics affected public discourse and popular conceptions of poverty and inequality in the United Kingdom in various ways. The far-reaching implications of statistical knowledge for political thought and debates on the welfare state or questions of social justice have been demonstrated by Jim Tomlinson, who has shown that the \u2018search for equality\u2019 in twentieth-century British history was based on an interplay of doctrinal views and understandings of income and wealth inequality that were shaped by statistics.[CITATION-27] By historicising the underlying statistics, the present article attempts to take this research further. It explores knowledge politics as an under-researched technology of power that was aimed at influencing political discourse, representations, and perceptions of social inequalities.[CITATION-28] It will argue that Thatcherite knowledge politics were designed to marginalise issues of economic inequality to bolster the neo-liberal revolution.In short, this article will analyse how ministers and officials under Thatcher systematically reduced the production of inequality knowledge (Section I) and intervened in official poverty statistics to steer Britain and Europe away from relativist measures (Section II). Section III will show how the government constructed and used faulty statistics to promulgate the trickle-down narrative, before Section IV explains how experts and activists managed to reverse some of the opacity that was introduced to this field under Thatcher.When Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street in 1979, she inherited a knowledge regime that produced more statistics on economic inequality than ever before and was firmly based on relativist measurements and concepts. While the Beveridgean welfare state in the post-war era had operated on notions of subsistence, the concept of relative poverty gained traction through the \u2018rediscovery of poverty\u2019 in the mid-1960s, and in particular through the scholarly work of Peter Townsend and Brian Abel-Smith. Their groundbreaking book(1965) revealed alarming levels of poverty, measured by numbers of households with incomes below the level of National Assistance or at certain percentages above\u2014it argued that a poverty line should be drawn at 140 per cent of National Assistance.[CITATION-29] The findings sparked wide-ranging debates about social policies and led to an increase in research activities that enshrined the concept of relative poverty as a prevailing norm in the knowledge regime.[CITATION-30] Statisticians in the DHSS adopted Townsend and Abel-Smith\u2019s methodology in a new survey of \u2018Family Circumstances\u2019 in 1966 and in subsequent smaller enquiries that used the Supplementary Benefit level as a benchmark, even if this measure was not recognised by the government as an official poverty line.[CITATION-31] This line of enquiry eventually resulted in a regular statistical series: in May 1974, the DHSS started to publish annual tables in Hansard showing the numbers of people by family type at various multiples of the Supplementary Benefit level.[CITATION-32] The tables were widely regarded as the main statistic on poverty in the United Kingdom and the Supplementary Benefit level was widely used as an unofficial poverty line. For both these reasons, the series later came under attack from the Thatcher government.The rediscovery of poverty was also closely associated with the transformation of the political landscape in the United Kingdom through the establishment of anti-poverty NGOs such as the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), a leading organisation in the emerging \u2018poverty lobby\u2019.[CITATION-33] Some of the arguments and controversies over poverty under Thatcher had thus already occurred in similar, if less intense, debates during the late 1960s and 1970s. Academic experts such as Townsend criticised the government for delays and omissions in official reports and for misleading statistical definitions that deliberately lowered the poverty count.[CITATION-34] CPAG attacked the government over its record on poverty and triggered debates about the numbers.[CITATION-35] In response to the criticism, neither Labour nor Conservative governments accepted any official definition of poverty, let alone an official poverty line; the validity of the Supplementary Benefit level as a benchmark was disputed on the grounds that up-ratings in benefits would have the paradoxical effect of increasing the poverty count.[CITATION-36] The same defensive arguments were later employed by Thatcher\u2019s governments; but while clearly not of a Thatcherite pedigree alone, under Thatcher they were coupled with an anti-egalitarian political philosophy and the rejection of the concept of relative poverty.In the early 1970s, academic and public debates in and outside the United Kingdom shifted from poverty to issues of overall inequality.[CITATION-37] Economists rediscovered personal income and wealth distribution as previously neglected areas of research.[CITATION-38] In party politics, the Labour Party developed an ambitious left-wing programme with a stronger redistributive drive than ever,[CITATION-39] and, once in power, it set up a Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth (RCDIW) as a standing body to analyse past and present trends in economic inequality.[CITATION-40] In the state bureaucracy, the rediscovery of inequality coincided with a wider move towards a more knowledge-based policy-making process: incorporating knowledge about the distributive effects of social policies became a central concern in the Joint Approach to Social Policy (JASP), an interdepartmental initiative that was relaunched in spring 1974 by the Central Policy Review staff after a previous effort under the Heath government \u2018ran into heavy fire both from ministers and officials\u2019.[CITATION-41] Furthermore, the 1970s were widely seen as a period of particularly close relations between academic social policy experts, policy-makers, officials, activists and journalists\u2014although certain barriers remained, in particular in the DHSS, as the former chairman of the Supplementary Benefits Commission, David Donnison, noted.[CITATION-42] The social democratic moment in the mid-1970s represented the high-water mark of distributional politics and the zenith of the knowledge regime pertaining to economic inequality in the United Kingdom.[CITATION-43] To be sure, the work of the RCDIW was criticised by academic experts for its abstention from political discussions, and right-wing commentators were able to misrepresent its findings to make the case for anti-egalitarian policies; later commentators even described the commission as a futile episode.[CITATION-44] On the other hand, the activities of the commission led to improvements in the measurement of income distribution and in the visual presentation of the statistics, which made the published tables more comprehensible.[CITATION-45] Most importantly perhaps, the regular reports of the RCDIW secured a more prominent place for inequality knowledge in political culture and provided wide-ranging up-to-date statistics on an annual basis\u2014in sharp contrast to the reduced availability of official statistics under Thatcher. However, the social democratic moment in the mid-1970s proved short-lived and was overturned by growing concerns over public expenditure, especially following the financial crisis of 1976.[CITATION-46] While the general political climate was palpably turning against progressive politics, support for the work of the RCDIW and other initiatives waned among the public, the government, and the civil service.[CITATION-47] The new prime minister, James Callaghan, and the Central Statistical Office (CSO) blocked key projects of the RCDIW in 1977/78, among them the long overdue project of a continuous survey on wealth inequality; the commission staff blamed the income distribution specialist at the CSO, Deo Ramprakash, who later became a leading statistician under Thatcher.[CITATION-48] At the same time, key initiatives of JASP met with similar resistance\u2014most importantly, the proposal to incorporate statistical knowledge about the distributive effects of social policies into the policy-making process.[CITATION-49] As these examples demonstrate, the period after 1976 foreshadowed the rollback of knowledge production after 1979, but while the Callaghan administration discouraged further expansion of statistical programmes, it did not attempt to cut back or transform any existing statistical series.After 1979, the knowledge regime pertaining to economic inequality in the United Kingdom was transformed through changes to norms, practices and institutions. The transformation of political norms concerning inequality and poverty had begun while the Conservative Party was still in opposition. As David Edgerton has observed, the political thought of the two main parties partly evolved in reaction to each other,[CITATION-50] and the hardening of the Thatcherites\u2019 anti-egalitarian stance on inequality during the social democratic moment of the 1970s is a case in point. The tone was set by Margaret Thatcher in a programmatic speech in late 1975, in which she argued strongly against the pursuit of equality through redistributive policies and lamented that the rich were getting poorer, while the poor were getting richer\u2014a claim that was based on a very selective reading of existing statistics, as the RCDIW noted.[CITATION-51] Another progenitor of Thatcherism, Keith Joseph, had not denied the existence of poverty, and he fully endorsed the concept of relative poverty while he was Secretary of State for Social Services under Heath.[CITATION-52] But by 1979 his views had markedly shifted, as he rejected any relativist notion of poverty and claimed that there was \u2018very little poverty in Britain\u2019 by absolute standards.[CITATION-53] The Thatcherites reacted in a similar vein to the narratives of the \u2018poverty lobby\u2019 and the scholarly works of leading experts. In December 1979, Thatcher\u2019s Secretary of Social Security, Patrick Jenkin, responded to the publication of Peter Townsend\u2019s bookand the ensuing public debate with a major speech, in which he not only dismissed the concept of relative poverty, but also launched a personal attack on Townsend as an expert.[CITATION-54] While it is true that Townsend\u2019s theory of relative deprivation as an objective definition of poverty was questioned even by leading experts such as David Piachaud, the concept of relative poverty as such was exempt from this critique,[CITATION-55] in sharp contrast to the approach of the Thatcherites, right-wing newspapers and think tanks.[CITATION-56] Once in power, the anti-egalitarian ideology of the Thatcherites translated into a systematic reduction of knowledge production on economic inequality. First of all, the government shut down the RCDIW in July 1979, as Thatcher and her ministers anticipated that any future work of the commission would only generate more controversies over inequality, an outcome which was not deemed desirable.[CITATION-57] In late 1979, ministers also explained to senior government statisticians that they were \u2018sceptical\u2019 about the continued need for official income and wealth statistics, except for purposes of \u2018defensive briefing\u2019.[CITATION-58] The first statistical series that was affected was the main poverty statistic, the Hansard tables giving the numbers of families with incomes below the Supplementary Benefit level, which were now to be published biennially rather than annually.[CITATION-59] Consequently, the first edition of the Low Income Families tables covering the period after 1979 was not published until 1983; it showed an increase of 40 per cent in the numbers of families on low incomes during the first two years of the Thatcher government.[CITATION-60] Another source was shut down in 1980, when the government abolished the Supplementary Benefits Commission, whose annual reports also contained information about the numbers of Supplementary Benefits recipients.[CITATION-61] Further cuts to major statistical series on inequality and poverty followed in the implementation of the White Paper on Government Statistical Services from April 1981, based on the recommendations of the so-called Rayner review, a cost-cutting exercise in the civil service.[CITATION-62] Its rationale was to reorient the Government Statistical Service (GSS) towards the needs of the government, while the provision of information to society was to be left to political parties, pressure groups and the media.[CITATION-63] Critics spoke of the \u2018Rayner doctrine\u2019 as a turning point that eroded the integrity of government statistics and betrayed \u2018a fundamental shift in attitude towards research in general\u2019.[CITATION-64] It marked a deliberate departure from the drive towards a more knowledge-based approach to policy-making that had been pursued by previous governments during the 1970s. Most importantly, the Central Statistical Office was instructed to stop work on the distribution of wealth and to reduce work on the distribution of income; the annual CSO estimates on income distribution in the official journalwere cut back to a three-year interval. This meant that the first official analysis covering the Thatcher years did not appear until December 1984; it showed a marked increase in the Gini coefficient after tax from 33.5 to 36.0 per cent between 1978/79 and 1981/82.[CITATION-65] This analysis was followed by only one more CSO estimate in 1987, three years before Thatcher resigned. This time, the Gini coefficient had increased before tax, but remained at 36 per cent after tax\u2014a somewhat deceptive result, as the Gini coefficient as a summary measure reveals nothing about shifting relativities at different points within the distribution of income.[CITATION-66] To be sure, other relevant statistical series such as the annual analyses of the redistributive effects of the tax/benefit system or the official earnings statistics continued to be published on an annual basis as before, but these series did not cover trends in income inequality over time and could not substitute for theanalyses, which were widely regarded as the most authoritative source. Similarly, information on social inequalities was available in some of the issues of the CSO journal, but critics noticed that the journal put less emphasis on distributional questions than before 1979.[CITATION-67] The retrenchment of the statistical system created a situation where no authoritative official figures about Thatcher\u2019s record on poverty and income inequality were available until 1983/84. The situation was exacerbated by the government\u2019s frequent interventions in unemployment statistics, which rendered them less reliable as an indicator for economic hardship in a period of re-emerging mass unemployment and related poverty.[CITATION-68] Critics such as the Labour MP Frank Field protested against what they saw as a systematic cover-up.[CITATION-69] In the spring of 1982, the Trades Union Congress, supported by Frank Field and Peter Townsend, even mounted a public campaign to \u2018save our statistics\u2019.[CITATION-70] Contrary to the public reassurances of the GSS director, John Boreham, the cuts reduced the capacity of the CSO to provide information to Parliament and affected its ability to engage with international organisations; in internal reports, Boreham himself warned colleagues about the \u2018adverse effects\u2019 of the cuts on quality.[CITATION-71] The cuts also had an impact on public discourse on poverty and inequality. In parliamentary debates, both sides of the House of Commons continued to use a \u2018torrent of statistics\u2019, but as authoritative figures on income inequality were unavailable, MPs resorted to proxy indicators that were more limited in their diagnostic and presentational potential.[CITATION-72] Consequently, the absence of official income distribution statistics transformed what was sayable about inequality during the early 1980s: in a major debate in the House of Commons on 28 June 1984, for example, MPs could equally make claims about the \u2018widening of the gap between the rich and the poor\u2019 and claims to the effect \u2018that there was no growing inequality\u2019.[CITATION-73] Compared to the 1970s, the knowledge regime also changed at the level of communicative practices, a process that was accompanied by the increasingly adversarial dynamics between the government and its critics. The stance of government ministers and officials became noticeably more defensive. This applied in particular to the DHSS, which was responsible for the main poverty statistic, the Low Income Families tables. In contrast to the CSO, the DHSS statistics were produced in a more political environment, where departmental statisticians collaborated with civil servants from policy divisions. Both branches worked together in the preparation of briefings for the Cabinet and the prime minister on issues of poverty and inequality: the departmental records contain countless elaborate dossiers and briefings discussing possible responses to new academic studies, newspaper articles, broadcasts, or parliamentary questions. Before the briefings were used in Parliament or in other public appearances, they were further edited in meetings between officials, ministers and their special advisors, but the narratives about statistical questions were mostly developed by civil servants, while special advisors usually only \u2018sexed up\u2019 the language.[CITATION-74] Briefings on social security matters were also produced by other government departments and external partisan bodies, notably the Conservative Research Department (CRD), but the CRD input was not as strong on statistical details as the DHSS briefings.[CITATION-75] Even Thatcher\u2019s personal advisors in the Policy Unit turned to the specialists in the DHSS or the Treasury when they required advice on statistics and how to present them.[CITATION-76] In comparison to similar briefings and discussions on presentational issues in the DHSS and other government departments from the 1970s,[CITATION-77] the DHSS briefings from the 1980s were more professionally organised, with sections on \u2018lines to take\u2019 or \u2018defensive lines\u2019 that often contained ready-made political sound bites. Sections on \u2018bull points\u2019 with statistical ammunition for the public debate were frequently followed by sections on \u2018elephant traps\u2019 that warned ministers and officials of contradicting evidence and other pitfalls. The records also reveal a growing inclination towards political spin. While the Treasury under Heath often decided to \u2018maintain a low profile rather than enter into detailed arguments\u2019 in public debates on poverty and inequality during the early 1970s,[CITATION-78] the DHSS briefings from the 1980s betray a greater preparedness to advance bull points despite numerous elephant traps. The heightened concern with public relations partly reflected a more general trend in British society.[CITATION-79] On the other hand, it can also be explained by the pedagogic impetus of the Thatcher government,[CITATION-80] which found it increasingly necessary to \u2018launch formidable campaigns to inform and convince the public\u2019 and to prove to their opponents \u2018that they are wrong and that we are right\u2019, as one of Thatcher\u2019s personal advisors put it.[CITATION-81] The government was aware that growing inequality posed a particular challenge in this context. As an internal memorandum explained in June 1984, the \u2018widening gap between rich and poor\u2019 was \u2018hard to defend unless you can show (a) that incentives have been restored at the bottom as well as at the top, and (b) that the safety net\u2019 and \u2018living standards at the bottom have gone up since 1979\u2019.[CITATION-82] The DHSS attempted to mount this defence in many briefings, while statistical indicators increasingly pointed to the contrary. For example, in the public debate about the rising poverty figures reflected in the Low Income Families tables in 1983, the \u2018line to take\u2019 was to point to \u2018the nonsensical effect of seemingly creating poverty by raising the supplementary benefit level and making people better off\u2019, while officials expressed \u2018doubt whether this played a significant part in the increase\u2019.[CITATION-83] The government stuck to this defensive line throughout the decade despite the fact that the real value of Supplementary Benefit \u2018remained virtually static\u2019 during the 1980s.[CITATION-84] Other government departments such as the Treasury were equally aware that the policy to provide \u2018incentives\u2019 and thereby improve living standards for all had \u2018yet to show substantive results\u2019, five years into Thatcher\u2019s premiership: officials found only \u2018weak-ish\u2019 evidence of \u2018positive aspects\u2019 that were consequently \u2018worked up a bit\u2019.[CITATION-85] The changing public relations practices are demonstrated by the handling of parliamentary questions in the DHSS. As the government systematically reduced public access to statistical knowledge about poverty and inequality, the opposition increasingly relied on parliamentary questions as a means to extract statistical information from the government, a technique that was also advocated by the Child Poverty Action Group.[CITATION-86] In order to challenge the government narrative of \u2018a successful economy\u2019 and \u2018better living standards for all\u2019, opposition MPs tabled more and more parliamentary questions about the relatively slow increases of earnings at the bottom of the distribution. In early 1984, DHSS officials observed that \u2018the questioning has become more sophisticated and asked for the real take-home pay of those on the top and bottom deciles\u2019.[CITATION-87] In response to the increased questioning, DHSS officials adopted a \u2018slightly more rigorous approach to answering some statistical PQs\u2019, as an internal note put it, and in early 1980, they sought ministerial approval for adopting an even more rigorous approach.[CITATION-88] In practice, this meant that DHSS officials tended to keep the release of statistical knowledge in their prepared replies to a minimum. In response to a parliamentary question by the Labour MP Gordon Brown about women\u2019s incomes in 1988, for example, officials provided figures that were deliberately \u2018hard to interpret\u2019, as an internal note explained: they only represented average incomes, which had the effect of \u2018obscur[ing] differences\u2019 between women in various status groups; tables detailing these differences, which proved to be \u2018very large\u2019 in parts, were withheld by the department.[CITATION-89] Such methods attracted criticism even from within the department. In October 1986, one of the departmental statisticians, Nick Kew, complained about \u2018the deliberate opacity in the presentation of statistics\u2019 in replies to parliamentary questions, which had the \u2018intended effect\u2019 that \u2018the questioner is so confused that he cannot work out what, if anything, the figures are saying and ceases to try\u2019.[CITATION-90] The changing communicative practices were an expression of the deteriorating relations between government departments and academics and activists outside the government. Compared to the 1970s, the DHSS became less open to exchanges and co-operation, and the tone of DHSS briefings became more adversarial, often couched in belligerent metaphors with the provision of \u2018ammunition\u2019 for public rebuttals,[CITATION-91] or the suggestion of a \u2018pre-emptive strike\u2019.[CITATION-92] Internal discussions about how to rebut new academic research were sometimes accompanied by derogatory remarks about academic experts\u2014for example, when DHSS officials denounced Peter Townsend as a \u2018socialist guru\u2019.[CITATION-93] Attacks on the \u2018intellectual respectability\u2019 of academic experts were also launched by Cabinet ministers in public speeches.[CITATION-94] While governments in the 1970s had frequently consulted academic experts, it was symptomatic of the new attitude that the DHSS decided in 1986 to conduct a major review of the main poverty statistic behind closed doors. The mutual estrangement increased towards the end of the decade, with a series of public scandals.[CITATION-95] Critics such as the Labour MP Michael Meacher accused the Thatcher government of \u2018fact phobia\u2019 and \u2018fiddling with the figures\u2019, and the government accused the critics of \u2018misinformation\u2019 and \u2018abuse of statistics\u2019.[CITATION-96] The frequent allegations over political manipulations of government statistics under Thatcher also concerned other statistical areas such as unemployment statistics, where the government made a total of thirty changes to statistical definitions up until 1989, of which twenty-four lowered the unemployment count.[CITATION-97] Another public debate unfolded in 1987/88 over the redistributive effects of the Social Security Act of 1986, as the government faced accusations of false claims about gainers and losers in the reform.[CITATION-98] Much of the concern over the integrity of government statistics was caused by scandals about poverty and income statistics, in particular with respect to the long delays in the publication of key statistical series.[CITATION-99] After the publication of the Low Income Family tables in 1983, the next edition was due in 1985, but was delayed until 1986: when the tables were finally placed in the House of Commons library three hours after Parliament had gone into recess on 25 July 1986, the \u2018angry protests\u2019 of Labour MPs and anti-poverty activists in the ensuing \u2018cover-up row\u2019 received considerable media attention.[CITATION-100] Government spokespersons explained the delay with technical difficulties, but the departmental records corroborate contemporary suspicions that the delay was politically engineered. In late July 1986, the departmental statistician Nick Kew offered the criticism in an internal note that \u2018ministers and officials did continue to ascribe the delay to \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d months after this ceased to be the case\u2014most notably in Tony Newton\u2019s evidence to the Social Services Committee in June\u2019.[CITATION-101] Internal enquiries in the DHSS showed that the tables had been ready for publication by April or early May 1986; after this point, the timing of the publication had been left to the discretion of two ministers and the Secretary of State, namely John Major, Tony Newton, and Norman Fowler.[CITATION-102] The delay between early May and late July eventually made a considerable difference because it was during this period that Parliament debated the government\u2019s landmark Social Security Bill\u2014it passed both chambers in May and July.[CITATION-103] As a senior civil servant in the DHSS, Ann Bowtell, explained in another internal note, the delayed publication of the Low Income Families tables prevented them from \u2018becoming an issue\u2019: \u2018Had they been published they probably would have become an issue, and possibly made the Bill more difficult to get through\u2019.[CITATION-104] Similar political considerations prevented the publication of key statistics close to general elections. No up-to-date statistics on poverty and income distribution were available during the general election campaigns of 1983 and 1987. In 1987, the latest available figures related to 1983. The Low Income Families tables for 1985 were due for publication in the autumn, but when civil servants in the DHSS discussed planning in late 1986, they were already anticipating the political reasoning against timely publication: \u2018Ministers may be wary about autumn 1987 publication of the 1985 figures depending on the timing of the election\u2019.[CITATION-105] Consequently, the publication of the statistic was delayed until May 1988. The same practice continued after Thatcher\u2019s resignation: in the run-up to the general election of 1992, the main results of the new low income statistic, Households Below Average Income, were expected to be available by March, but ministers decided against the release of \u2018headline figures\u2019 before the election date on 9 April, on the basis of official advice not \u2018to become embroiled in a renewed debate about poverty and inequality\u2019.[CITATION-106] This had not been imposed by ministers, but was suggested by a civil servant in the DSS, David Allsop, who had warned in July 1991 that \u2018we might be causing Ministers some embarrassment if we go for publication in April 1992\u2019.[CITATION-107] Instead, his advice was to \u2018ask Ministers what priority they give to producing these figures and how they would feel if things slipped a bit\u2019.In combination with the cuts to statistical programmes, the deliberate delays further reduced the amount of statistical knowledge on poverty and inequality that was available to the public. Researchers outside the government were able to compensate for the dearth of official figures from large-scale government surveys only to a certain degree. While the main British household survey, the Family Expenditure Survey, was based on a sample of about 7,000 households, one of the largest independent investigations undertaken in the 1980s, the \u2018Breadline Britain\u2019 survey, was based on a sample of 1,174 persons.[CITATION-108] It was modelled after Peter Townsend\u2019s concept of relative deprivation and measured economic resources indirectly through access to goods and living conditions; the findings were presented in a headline-grabbing television series in 1983. In 1985/86, Peter Townsend was commissioned by the Greater London Council (GLC) to direct a survey of living standards in the capital, which collected income data from 2,700 interviewees: the survey provided a rare London-wide snapshot, but as a stand-alone survey it could not trace trends over time.[CITATION-109] The same limitation applied to borough-level analyses such as the large social survey carried out in Islington in 1987, again in co-operation with Townsend.[CITATION-110] For an analysis of changes in income distribution in London between 1961 and 1981, the GLC had mined the Family Expenditure Survey, but after 1981 the size of the sub-sample covering London fell below acceptable levels.[CITATION-111] Other local surveys were even smaller in scale, or measured poverty by non-financial indicators such as unemployment or the number of children entitled to free school meals.[CITATION-112] Similarly, national and local studies of deprivation in urban areas during the 1970s and 1980s relied primarily on census data that excluded income; as a proxy for income, the Department of the Environment suggested the number of Supplementary Benefit recipients that could be obtained from local DHSS offices.[CITATION-113] DHSS statistics were equally indispensable for leading NGOs such as the Child Poverty Action Group. CPAG\u2019s campaigns and publications relied first and foremost on \u2018official statistics and other studies\u2019, as the group could only undertake \u2018small-scale research\u2019 of their own.[CITATION-114] For example, in the 1987 edition of CPAG\u2019s booklet \u2018Poverty\u2014The Facts\u2019, the main source that was cited to trace the incidence of poverty up to 1983 was the DHSS\u2019s Low Income Families tables published in 1986.[CITATION-115] The knowledge regime under Thatcher also proved to be an adverse environment for innovation and necessary investment in official statistics. Long-standing gaps and deficiencies remained unaddressed in the 1980s and into the 1990s. The partly unfinished work that the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth had devoted to wealth distribution and higher incomes was discontinued under Thatcher. While earnings statistics showed disproportionate gains among top earners, it was widely acknowledged that their income shares were persistently understated in key statistics like the Family Expenditure Survey, as a result of under-reporting and lower response rates among the wealthy elite. What was not known to the public was that the problem was exacerbated by practices in the computation of the statistics within the Central Statistical Office:[CITATION-116] government statisticians arbitrarily deleted extreme earnings such as \u2018large City bonuses\u2019 from the datasets, as they were regarded as outliers.[CITATION-117] When government statisticians discussed the problem in 1990, they were aware of the \u2018political significance\u2019 of the issue in light of \u2018the growing inequality apparent in the FES data\u2019, and one of them wondered: \u2018Where does removal of implausible cases end and doctoring the data begin?\u2019[CITATION-118] It was symptomatic of the priorities in the GSS under Thatcher that the problem had long been identified, but not resolved.Other neglected areas included regional statistics and statistics on ethnic minorities; both represented critical dimensions of growing inequalities in the United Kingdom during the 1980s. Proposals to address these gaps in government statistics failed to make much progress during the 1970s and stalled during the 1980s.[CITATION-119] Up until 1994/95, the Department of Social Security resisted calls for regional analyses of the department\u2019s low income statistics. Internal discussions in 1992 showed that it was technically possible to break down the income data by deciles and regions, but the department\u2019s policy was still \u2018blanket refusal to produce regional data at any level\u2019.[CITATION-120] Similarly, the department did not introduce ethnicity as an analytical category in the low income statistics until 1994/95. Income data on ethnic minorities had remained \u2018clearly limited\u2019 throughout the 1970s, especially after the failure of an experiment in using the census as a source for income distribution.[CITATION-121] Under Thatcher, this situation remained unchanged: by the end of the 1980s, the DHSS had not even started to collect any data on ethnic minorities in its administrative statistics.[CITATION-122] An underlying cause for these long-standing gaps in British official statistics lay in the relatively small sample sizes of the principal household surveys, which severely limited the possibilities of cross-sectional analyses.[CITATION-123] Experts had called for significant increases in the sample sizes during the 1970s, but the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth prioritised administrative data over household surveys, and the Thatcher government even imposed further cuts to sample sizes.[CITATION-124] As we shall see, this changed in 1990, when the discovery of fundamental errors in the low income statistics finally convinced the DSS to develop a new large-scale income survey, the Family Resources Survey, which has remained the basis of low income statistics in the country to this day.The debates about the publication of the Low Income Families tables in 1986 initiated a phase of even deeper government interventions in official statistics, as ministers and officials endeavoured to scrap the traditional poverty count that went back to the \u2018rediscovery of poverty\u2019 in the mid-1960s. The process was started by John Major\u2019s announcement of a \u2018technical review\u2019 of the Low Income Families tables, which was carried out by a DHSS working group beginning in the autumn of 1986. In March 1988, the working group published a report which concluded that the Low Income Families tables should be replaced by a more extensive new series titled Households below Average Income (HBAI).[CITATION-125] Consequently, the Low Income Families tables for 1985 published on 19 May 1988, along with the first edition of the new HBAI series, were announced as the final edition. In response to the reform, both the Child Poverty Action Group and the parliamentary Social Security Select Committee under the chairmanship of Frank Field welcomed the introduction of a more wide-ranging statistical series on low incomes, but demanded the continuation of the Low Income Families tables as an important source about the incidence of low incomes over time.[CITATION-126] In a long-delayed response, the DHSS rejected the requests of the Social Security Select Committee on the grounds that the use of Supplementary Benefit scale rates as a measure of poverty was \u2018misleading\u2019 and produced \u2018ludicrous\u2019 results.[CITATION-127] The decision-making process behind the scrapping of the Low Income Families tables was led by DHSS ministers and backed by Thatcher, but the groundwork was delivered by civil servants. The episode thus also sheds new light on more general questions about ministerial\u2013civil service relationships in the 1980s. Contrary to conventional narratives of increasingly fractious working relations and mutual hostility under Thatcher, rifts emerged not so much between ministers and the civil service as a whole, but rather within the civil service.[CITATION-128] Instead of resisting government initiatives on this front, civil servants proactively supported the plans, notably the officials from the DHSS\u2019s Social Security Policy Group, Division B, while opposition was voiced by departmental statisticians in the Statistics and Research division (SR) and the Central Statistical Office. Even before the review process started, the departmental statistician Nick Kew conveyed his concerns to a colleague in the Statistics and Research subdivision SR3 that the \u2018administrative colleagues\u2019 from the policy divisions paid only \u2018lip service\u2019 to statistical integrity: \u2018in the final analysis they are inclined to subordinate it entirely to the avoidance of Ministerial embarrassment. This does not fill me with confidence about the conduct and outcome of the technical review\u2019.[CITATION-129] When the technical review started in September 1986, statisticians from SR and officials from B2, a subdivision of Division B, differed on three issues that not only represented methodological questions, but also had political implications. From the start, officials from B2 pressed for the abolition of the traditional threshold analysis based on the Supplementary Benefit level, while statisticians from SR3 welcomed the review as an opportunity to make necessary improvements to the Low Income Families tables, but regarded the plans to scrap the statistic as a political manoeuvre that \u2018reflected Ministers\u2019 preferences\u2019.[CITATION-130] In a comment on the initial discussions, Nick Kew spelled out to his colleague in B2, Stephen Hickey, that he regarded the threshold analysis as \u2018a valid instrument\u2019 of \u2018profound public interest\u2019; \u2018if ministers prefer to say as little as possible about changes in low income incidence\u2019, that would be \u2018an essentially political decision\u2019 on which the review team should not \u2018seek to confer a technical legitimacy\u2019.[CITATION-131] In the \u2018threshold debate\u2019, SR received support from the Central Statistical Office, while B2 was encouraged by the Treasury, which expressed its \u2018desire to drop the SB yardstick\u2019.[CITATION-132] Similar debates and dividing lines emerged in discussions about the base year of the reformed statistical series, with SR favouring 1979 and B2 advocating 1981, the latter because of the \u2018severe political problems created by a 1979 base year\u2019 as it revealed the regressive effects of the recession of 1980/81.[CITATION-133] The third contentious issue was the possible return to annual publication of the low income statistics, which was supported by SR and the CSO, but opposed by B2.[CITATION-134] The balance in the discussions was eventually tipped through a series of interventions by DHSS ministers with assistance from B2 officials in late 1987 and early 1988. Firstly, the junior minister Michael Portillo informed the review team \u2018that if we used 1979 as a base year \u201cthe PM would roast us alive!\u201d\u2019\u2014an unambiguous message showing that Thatcher took an active interest in the statistical discussions and had clear expectations about the desired outcomes.[CITATION-135] Furthermore, in a memorandum prepared by Stephen Hickey from B2, Portillo argued against the plans to return to annual publication of the statistic, as he was \u2018concerned that it would mean that all the issues of \u201cpoverty\u201d are simply raised more often\u2019.[CITATION-136] After discussions with Portillo, Hickey also reinforced the critique of the threshold analysis in the draft report of the review team, and in early March 1988, the Secretary of State, John Moore, eventually decided that the Low Income Families tables were to be discontinued after the final edition in 1988.[CITATION-137] The decision to scrap the Low Income Families tables was motivated expressly by the aim of decoupling the low income statistics from the concept of relative poverty. This was openly discussed among officials during the review process: \u2018Can we get away from the relative approach to poverty?\u2019[CITATION-138] Even at a late stage in the review process, Moore reminded his officials not to fall \u2018into the same trap of looking at income and poverty in relative rather than absolute terms\u2019 as in previous years\u2014from Moore\u2019s point of view, this was a \u2018debate lost when poverty was \u201crediscovered\u201d in the \u201960s\u2019.[CITATION-139] Conversely, the scrapping of the Low Income Families tables was seen as a political victory over the \u2018poverty lobby\u2019. One of the most vocal proponents of the government\u2019s views among the civil servants in B2, Ian Williams, described the strategy retrospectively to a colleague in a triumphant tone: \u2018By adopting this approach the government shifted the basis of the \u201cpoverty\u201d debate on to grounds of their choosing. In the process, the Government also undermined the poverty lobby\u2019s favourite concept\u2014the \u201cpoverty line\u201d and took away the poverty lobby\u2019s favourite propaganda instrument\u2014the Low Income Families Statistics\u2019.[CITATION-140] At the same time, DHSS ministers and officials also attempted to steer the public debate away from relativist notions of poverty. The most drastic intervention was delivered by Moore on 11 May 1989 in a programmatic speech on poverty drafted by the B2 civil servant David Allsop: he dismissed relative poverty as \u2018simply inequality\u2019 and claimed that \u2018those with lower incomes\u2019 enjoyed living standards far above subsistence levels.[CITATION-141] Moore\u2019s claim that absolute poverty no longer existed in Britain was also publicly backed by Thatcher.[CITATION-142] To be sure, interest in the concept of absolute poverty was not only expressed by the Thatcherites; even independent scholars such as Amartya Sen argued for retaining an \u2018absolute core\u2019 in the definition of poverty.[CITATION-143] However, the Thatcher government had no serious interest in defining or measuring it.It is worth noting in this context that the setting of a minimum standard of living was advocated even by neo-liberal thinkers: analysts at the Institute of Economic Affairs held the view that the state should not be concerned with income relativities, but should ensure acceptable living standards among the poorest in society.[CITATION-144] During the technical review of the low income statistics, Moore had recognised this issue as an opportunity to get \u2018behind relative measures of poverty\u2019, which meant he wished to get beyond them; in March 1988, he asked his departmental statisticians to produce data on \u2018absolute levels of need\u2019 and instructed them to \u2018investigate on a confidential basis\u2019 what information could be collected about \u2018absolute adequacy of benefit rates\u2019.[CITATION-145] The issue of the adequacy of benefit rates had been a bone of contention in debates on social security in the United Kingdom for decades, but the only official analysis undertaken by the state in the 1960s had been kept secret.[CITATION-146] Independent analyses such as the academic studies by David Piachaud from the early 1980s only reinforced the government\u2019s \u2018fear\u2019 that such analyses \u2018might lead to increases rather than reductions\u2019 in public expenditure, as one of the officials in B Division explained in response to Moore\u2019s request.[CITATION-147] DSS officials warned that research into adequacy of benefit rates carried the \u2018real risk of evidence that some or all of the rates are not adequate with consequent political embarrassment and pressure\u2019.[CITATION-148] Therefore, they asked for reassurance as to whether the Secretary of State wanted \u2018an honest enquiry into whether benefit rates are adequate, or evidence that they are\u2019; the officials suggested offering him \u2018a \u201cmenu\u201d of objectives\u2019 with options for analyses tailored to the desired outcome.[CITATION-149] In June 1988, the demand for a definition of minimum income was reinforced by a request for a government statement on this issue from Frank Field in his capacity as the chairman of the Social Security Select Committee. However, Ian Williams and other officials from B Division advised ministers \u2018to think very carefully before commissioning any research whatsoever\u2019 on this subject, as even confidential in-house analyses \u2018could inadvertently become public knowledge\u2019.[CITATION-150] Eventually, the government reiterated the position taken in the 1985 White Paper on Social Security reform, refusing to agree on any definition; instead, officials advised using Moore\u2019s forthcoming speech on poverty to address this issue.[CITATION-151] In his speech, Moore referred to rises in benefit rates, household expenditure and ownership of consumer durables to show that low income households were \u2018substantially better off than they have ever been before\u2019, but he steered clear of specifying the \u2018absolute levels of need\u2019 that he had enquired about during the technical review. The speech laid bare the inconsistencies in Thatcherite thinking on poverty: the Thatcherites rejected the concept of relative poverty and argued that living standards had been raised far above the subsistence minimum, but they refused to offer a precise definition of the subsistence minimum, let alone the concept of absolute poverty.The Thatcher government campaigned against the concept of relative poverty even beyond the borders of the United Kingdom, in repeated attempts to influence the statistical programmes of various international organisations.[CITATION-152] The ideological impetus distinguished these efforts from similar interventions by previous British governments. Conservative and Labour governments alike had resisted for decades the projects of various international organisations to establish a harmonised global system of statistics on income, wealth, and living standards; the main concern had been to prevent or delay regular international reporting and cross-country comparisons.[CITATION-153] The same concern was also behind the attempts of ministers and officials under Thatcher to contain the anti-poverty programmes of the European Communities (EC), but with an added drive to push back the use of the concept of relative poverty. As a result of consultations with independent experts in its first anti-poverty programme (1975\u201380), the EC defined the poverty line as 50 per cent of average net income, even if this relativist definition was \u2018not generally accepted by the governments of the member states\u2019.[CITATION-154] The poverty line was used by EC bodies to produce cross-country comparisons of poverty in Europe that were presented in published tables; the interim report on the second EC programme from 1989 in particular \u2018embarrassed\u2019 the British government, as it showed that the largest increases in poverty across Europe during the 1980s had occurred in the United Kingdom.[CITATION-155] Consequently, the Thatcher government sought to rein in the anti-poverty programmes even if room for manoeuvre was limited, as the majority of member states supported the programmes and the priority for British officials was \u2018to avoid the isolation of the UK in the discussions\u2019.[CITATION-156] In the discussions about a possible second anti-poverty programme in the EC in autumn 1982, the \u2018extremely reserved position\u2019 of the British delegation was supported only by West Germany.[CITATION-157] Again, in the discussions about a third anti-poverty programme in spring 1989, British officials stood alone in their unsuccessful attempts to convince their counterparts in the Working Party on Social Questions to replace the European definition of poverty with other measures similar to the new British HBAI statistic.[CITATION-158] Given the British government\u2019s \u2018position on the use of relative measures to define poverty\u2019, the Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, even suggested that the third EC programme should be vetoed altogether.[CITATION-159] However, John Moore, whose department was in charge of this matter, did \u2018not want to be seen\u2018 to be blocking the third anti-poverty programme, even if he was equally determined to prevent the EC from promulgating any \u2018further unacceptable statistics\u2019 based on a poverty line.[CITATION-160] Instead of open opposition, the British delegation advanced more technical arguments to delay the programme and to reduce its overall budgetary size, and in particular the statistical work.[CITATION-161] After the start of the third anti-poverty programme in 1989, British officials continued to lobby Europe to discard relative measures of poverty. In particular, the new chief statistician in the DSS, Deo Ramprakash, used every opportunity in meetings with European working groups or representatives to argue \u2018passionately\u2019 and \u2018violently\u2019 against the \u2018idea of a European poverty line\u2019.[CITATION-162] As an alternative, Ramprakash and B2 officials tried to convince their European counterparts of the British methodology in repeated efforts \u2018to sell Eurostat the HBAI approach for adoption in the community\u2019.[CITATION-163] However, the EC continued to publish figures based on the 50 per cent of average income measure, usually followed by rebuttals from the British government that dismissed the figures as \u2018totally arbitrary\u2019.[CITATION-164] As an official in B2 explained, this created a situation where the \u2018Commission uses these attention-grabbing figures as often as they can\u2019, while DSS officials \u2018seize every opportunity to explain the advantages of our HBAI approach\u2019 as well as \u201c\u2018rubbishing\u201d these figures at any EC meeting or conferences where they are cited\u2019.[CITATION-165] To counter the EC reports in domestic politics, the Thatcher government relied on the surprisingly favourable figures from the first HBAI edition from May 1988.When John Moore wrote to Margaret Thatcher on 22 March 1988 to seek her approval for the changes proposed in the report of the technical review, he stressed that the reformed statistical series would \u2018get us away from using supplementary benefit as the yardstick\u2019, but also conceded that it encompassed both \u2018\u201crelativist\u201d measures\u2019 and \u2018\u201cabsolute\u201d measures\u2019.[CITATION-166] Among the relativist measures represented in the new series were tables giving the numbers of households with incomes below various fractions of average income, similar to the much-criticised measure of half average income that was used in EC reports. Moore had attempted to intervene against the continued use of relativist measures during the last stage of the technical review, when he called on his statisticians to \u2018examine more radical alternatives\u2019, but this did not lead to any more substantial changes.[CITATION-167] This showed the limits of what ministers could demand from their civil servants and what was deemed palatable to the public. Within these limitations, DHSS officials used all existing options to design the new statistic to suit the government\u2019s narrative. As Ian Williams from B2 explained in an internal note, the \u2018published statistics\u2019 contained \u2018only a limited number of examples of what can be done using the HBAI methodology\u2019, while \u2018other\u2014possibly more revealing\u2014analyses which can be produced using the HBAI approach\u2019 were not included.[CITATION-168] Moreover, DHSS officials arranged the order and the layout of the tables \u2018with the aim of bringing the \u201cabsolute\u201d measures to the front\u2019.[CITATION-169] While not strictly an \u2018absolute measure\u2019, the measure of income growth over time was given the most prominent place. The first table showed percentage increases in real incomes between 1981 and 1985 by deciles in the bottom half of the population: it presented the striking finding of an above average increase of 8.3 per cent among the bottom 10 per cent.[CITATION-170] The table was repeated in the same form or appeared in modified versions on subsequent pages, each time showing the largest gains among the bottom decile.A number of methodological choices helped the DHSS to arrive at more favourable figures. For example, the use of equivalence scales to account for the pooling of incomes in households lowered the poverty count in the final edition of the Low Income Families tables by more than 1 million\u2014a move that was described by Ian Williams from B2 as \u2018presentationally advantageous\u2019, but also \u2018common sense\u2019.[CITATION-171] Similarly, the DHSS preferred to show incomes before the deduction of housing costs (BHC), while alternative tables based on incomes after housing costs (AHC) were given a less prominent place in the publication. As DHSS statisticians pointed out, this could make \u2018an enormous difference\u2019, as an increase in BHC could become a fall in AHC.[CITATION-172] Consequently, government ministers insisted on using BHC values as \u2018a single measure\u2019 in public statements.[CITATION-173] To be sure, all of these methodological choices were in keeping with statistical standards: for example, equivalisation had already been advocated by progressive government statisticians such as John Leonard Nicholson during the 1970s. However, most of the choices tended to work in the same direction. In a characteristic comment, one of the departmental statisticians warned Ian Williams from B2 in a related context that \u2018we must beware of getting into the business of treating HBAI and benefit unit analysis as alternatives from which we can choose whichever gives the best result on a particular occasion\u2019.[CITATION-174] DSS statisticians were aware that the HBAI methodology tended to overstate income growth among the bottom decile, not least on account of the exclusion of the homeless in the underlying data.[CITATION-175] Consequently, when doubts about the reliability of HBAI results led to a review of the methodology in 1991, most of the recommended methodological changes tended to lower the income growth figures for the bottom decile.[CITATION-176] The income growth figures published in Households Below Average Income in May 1988 gained so much prominence and caused so much controversy that officials later referred to it as \u2018the famous result that \u201cthe bottom decile did better than the average\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-177] Subsequently, the result was promoted as a big number by government ministers and officials in order to substantiate the government\u2019s narratives about the success of Thatcher\u2019s social and economic policies: for the remainder of her third term and beyond, it was used by the government and its supporters to deflect criticism and presented as a proof that Thatcherism made \u2018everyone better off\u2019.[CITATION-178] The Conservative Research Department was determined to put these and other statistics \u2018to the best possible use\u2019,[CITATION-179] and right-wing newspapers such as the Daily Telegraph reported the figures without question.[CITATION-180] However, achieving 8.3 per cent income growth in the bottom decile only became possible through presentational spin: Thatcher and her ministers had ensured that the analysis was limited to the period back to 1981, avoiding 1979 as a base year. As an internal memorandum explained, \u2018it was in fact a political decision not to publish 1979 data, because the figures looked unfavourable to the government. 1979 data were produced but DHSS policy side decided not to publish\u2019.[CITATION-181] The more unfavourable results remained secret for only a few weeks: in June 1988, a parliamentary question forced the DHSS to release some of the 1979 figures, which showed that as much as 70 per cent of the population had experienced losses in living standards between 1979 and 1981. As a consequence, the DHSS had to correct the income growth figure for the bottom decile to 6 per cent, but it withheld the information that this represented a smaller than average increase.[CITATION-182] This fact became public during the following year, but the DSS did not publish full results for 1979 until 1990 and did not adopt 1979 as a base year in the HBAI series until 1992.[CITATION-183] Following the publication of the \u2018famous result\u2019 in the HBAI from May 1988, DHSS officials made concerted efforts to protect statistical knowledge that contradicted the government\u2019s narrative of better living standards for all. In March 1987, the Economic Advisers Office (EAO) in the DHSS produced an internal analysis that showed falls in the incomes of the bottom 40 per cent of families with children between 1979 and 1985, while the incomes of the top 40 per cent rose\u2014subsequently, the analysis was given a security classification.[CITATION-184] Again, in late 1988 and early 1989, the EAO found clear evidence that the bottom two quintiles had seen falls in real incomes between 1979 and 1986.[CITATION-185] Internal discussions in the DSS concluded that this information should be kept secret, as Ian Williams from B2 was confident that most external researchers still lacked the resources to replicate the analysis: \u2018The direct threat in the immediate future of outsiders stumbling upon what the EAO has discovered is therefore limited\u2019.[CITATION-186] In the summer of 1989, DSS officials briefed Keith Joseph about the \u2018standstill in living standards for the lowest quintiles of families with children and actual (small) reductions in their incomes\u2019\u2014and advised him that this was \u2018not known publicly and could cause Ministers difficulty if it became known\u2019.[CITATION-187] This was not an isolated incident under Thatcher. Similar practices of withholding or spinning statistical knowledge about adverse effects of government policies on living standards can also be observed in the context of the regressive effects of indirect taxation (VAT), the Community Charge, and the Social Security reform of 1986.[CITATION-188] The Thatcher government upheld the narrative of better living standards for all despite growing evidence to the contrary. When conflicting findings emerged in an internal review of the income growth figures for the bottom quintile in January 1989, DSS officials realised that they should have suggested more \u2018restraint\u2019 to ministers in the use of the figures, but had \u2018missed this particular boat\u2019.[CITATION-189] An undeniable error in the HBAI figures was discovered by researchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), Paul Johnson and Steven Webb, in March 1990: a mistake in the computation of housing costs meant that the income growth figure for the bottom decilehad to be corrected to a mere 2.6 per cent.[CITATION-190] But as the figuresremained unaffected, the DSS defended the claim that the HBAI figures showed improvements in living standards \u2018for people in all groups\u2019\u2014and denied that the prime minister had ever misled Parliament in this matter.[CITATION-191] Critics such as Frank Field claimed that the corrected figures debunked the trickle-down theory.[CITATION-192] Nevertheless, both the Thatcher and Major governments continued to make the claim about the \u2018improvement in living standards at all levels\u2019 since 1979.[CITATION-193] The most serious error in the HBAI figures never became public knowledge. In late 1989, the DSS had commissioned three independent experts to conduct a feasibility study for a new income survey,[CITATION-194] and in the process the external consultants discovered substantial sampling errors in the HBAI statistic. The oft-cited income growth figures at the bottom of the distribution turned out to be the \u2018worst offenders\u2019: due to the small sample size of the underlying Family Expenditure Survey data, the figures were subject to error margins of +/- 16 per cent, which meant that the asserted increase of 6.6 per cent for the bottom quintile between 1981 and 1985 could have been \u2018anywhere between a 10% fall and a 23% increase\u2019.[CITATION-195] In the DSS, the evidence was initially seen as \u2018overwhelming\u2019 and departmental statisticians agreed with the consultants\u2019 assertion that the figures were \u2018so inaccurate as to be worthless\u2019. Deo Ramprakash, for example, lamented the \u2018highly questionable figures\u2019 and the \u2018bad practice\u2019 that had led to their publication.[CITATION-196] In a strongly worded note to David Allsop in B2, Ramprakash suggested changes to the methodology and attached tables calculated on a new basis, which showed significantly lower income growth rates: \u2018On either presentation, the poor have done substantially less well than the average for 1981\u201387, which is the new message. The difference is large whichever presentation is used and there will be no escaping the political flack [] because of the past overemphasis on the reverse, favourable position for 1981\u201385 based on unstable figures\u2019. The fact that the errors had not been identified earlier was a result of the refusal of the DSS to undertake sensitivity tests. The Social Security Select Committee under the chairmanship of Frank Field had asked the DSS to subject their statistics to sensitivity tests, but the DSS declined on the grounds of disproportionate costs\u2014in fact, on \u2018fairly marginal \u201cdisproportionate cost\u201d grounds\u2019, as one of the departmental statisticians admitted in an internal note.[CITATION-197] In early 1990, the discovery of the wide error margins in the HBAI series caused a flurry of discussions about the handling of the issue in the DSS. On the one hand, arguments were advanced \u2018for coming clean on this point in some low-profile way\u2019, but officials also warned of the \u2018political dangers\u2019 involved in the admission \u2018that the claim that between 1981 and 1985 the poorest groups did better than the average was based on a figure subject to wide random fluctuation\u2019.[CITATION-198] The initial shock about the errors receded in late April 1990 when the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys found an error in the consultants\u2019 analysis, which meant that the error margins in the income growth rates were narrower than originally estimated.[CITATION-199] However, subsequent analyses in the DSS showed that the error margins were still so wide as to render the figures unreliable: in fact, they ranged between +/- 5.3 per cent and +/- 8.8 per cent.[CITATION-200] As a solution to the problem, departmental statisticians found that the error margins could be \u2018considerably\u2019 reduced when the figures were based on the decile median instead of the decile average: in the lowest decile this option narrowed the confidence interval to +/-3.6 per cent.[CITATION-201] Consequently, the next HBAI edition from July 1990 switched the methodology to the median and also presented the less favourable results based on decile averages in an annex, but contained only general information about the issue of the error margins\u2014in the form of caveats in footnotes and in the annex about \u2018random sampling variation\u2019.[CITATION-202] Contrary to earlier suggestions by departmental statisticians, the DSS decided against the publication of the precise confidence intervals that would have made the scale of the problem transparent. The same tactic had been proposed by Deo Ramprakash in a similar discussion about the publication of a statistical analysis of pensioners\u2019 incomes in early 1990: \u2018Caveats about sampling errors should be attached but as general descriptive ones rather than a plethora of figures that, in effect, says: \u201cHere are the figures. They are useless\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-203] As a consequence, it escaped commentators that the income growth figures in the HBAI statistic from 1988, which were at the heart of the government\u2019s trickle-down narrative, were effectively baseless. Opposition politicians, including Michael Meacher, continued to criticise the government\u2019s \u2018fact phobia\u2019 and the \u2018endemic\u2019 manipulations of official statistics, but the issue of the reliability of the figures never surfaced in the public debates.[CITATION-204] Meanwhile, the problem had not been fully resolved by the methodological changes to the HBAI series in the edition from July 1990.[CITATION-205] The DSS initiated a \u2018stocktaking\u2019 review in early 1991 and consulted with external experts to address the robustness of the figures and other methodological issues. As a result, the next HBAI edition in 1992 combined two years of Family Expenditure Survey data with a view to increasing the sample size and decreasing the incidence of sampling errors.[CITATION-206] Furthermore, the episode helped to advance departmental plans to develop a new income survey with a much larger sample size of at least 20,000 households; the Family Resources Survey was piloted in 1992 and has remained the principal source for the analysis of income inequality in the country.[CITATION-207] After the internal discovery of the sampling errors had debunked the main findings of the 1988 HBAI edition, the ensuing \u2018stocktaking\u2019 review also invalidated the findings of the 1990 edition, as the methodological changes lowered the income growth rates in the bottom decile by up to 5.8 per cent.[CITATION-208] Based on the revised methodology, the 1992 edition showed only 2 per cent growth (before housing costs) in the incomes of the poorest during the 1980s compared to 8.5 per cent in the pre-stocktaking HBAI edition from 1990; after housing costs, the estimate fell from 0.1 to -6 per cent.[CITATION-209] In the late 1980s, the knowledge regime pertaining to economic inequality in the United Kingdom entered another transformative phase that prefigured many of the features of the present-day configuration. Firstly, technological advances in computing increasingly enhanced researchers\u2019 capabilities to verify official statistics and challenge the government\u2019s narratives, a development that was closely observed by officials in the DSS. In the early and mid-1980s, Anthony Atkinson and Holly Sutherland developed a computer simulation model at the London School of Economics to measure changes to the tax/benefit system.[CITATION-210] The capability of independent researchers to calculate the distributional effects of government policies had important implications for the political debate, as David Allsop from B2 explained to the Secretary of State in the autumn of 1989.[CITATION-211] At the same time, DSS officials also sounded a warning note with respect to the activities of the Luxembourg Income Study, an independent research group that started a new collaboration with the OECD in 1989 to establish a system of international reporting on cross-country comparisons of income inequality:[CITATION-212] \u2018Ministers can therefore expect international comparisons to become a much more important part of the debate about income levels, inequality, poverty and benefit adequacy\u2019.[CITATION-213] The government\u2019s much-criticised management of official statistics prompted new initiatives and collaborations among non-governmental actors, which changed the dynamics, practices, and the balance of power in the knowledge regime.[CITATION-214] Most importantly, the Institute for Fiscal Studies embarked on a series of studies in 1988 that helped to establish the institute\u2019s standing as one of the most authoritative voices in this field to the present day. Initially, the programme received funding from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and later studies were commissioned by the Social Security Select Committee under Frank Field.[CITATION-215] The IFS had developed their expertise in low income statistics through a series of initially minor technical enquiries with the DSS that officials found increasingly hard to decline.[CITATION-216] By the summer of 1989, the IFS had the capacity to replicate the HBAI statistic, which was noted in the DSS as a \u2018very significant development\u2019.[CITATION-217] Soon afterwards, the IFS was commissioned by the Social Security Select Committee to produce a new edition of the scrapped Low Income Families tables; this \u2018formal link\u2019 reinforced the apprehension in the DSS about \u2018increasingly being pushed into a series of defensive reactions\u2019.[CITATION-218] DSS officials such as Ian Williams of B2 were worried that the IFS \u2018might find some things we don\u2019t want them to\u2019, especially with respect to the critical period between 1979 and 1981.[CITATION-219] However, DSS officials came to the conclusion that it was not an option to reject the requests of the IFS for assistance: officials feared not only the possible public backlash, but also the prospect of the IFS producing alternative figures if it was not given access to HBAI data. DSS officials who anticipated in late 1988 that the IFS would \u2018sooner or later\u2019 be able to \u2018produce what we refuse to produce\u2019[CITATION-220] were proven right as the IFS went on to publish several analyses that the DSS had declined to publish, including an analysis that brought the HBAI series up to 1988 as well as an analysis that brought the scrapped Low Income Families tables up to 1987.[CITATION-221] Subsequently, DSS officials discussed how to respond to the challenge, but found their room for manoeuvre decreasing. In an attempt to defend their authority in this field, DSS statisticians even proposed a return to the annual publication of the low income statistics, because of the \u2018danger\u2019 that \u2018other versions of what\u2019s happened to living standards will in the meantime gain centre stage\u2019.[CITATION-222] During the stocktaking review, the DSS finally decided to reintroduce annual publication of the low income statistics in 1992. Officials in the DSS were all too aware of the changing dynamics in the knowledge regime: in early 1991, Deo Ramprakash noted that it was no longer possible to be \u2018complacent\u2019, as the IFS remained \u2018vigilant\u2019.[CITATION-223] Consequently, work in the DSS was increasingly guided by the aim \u2018to \u201ckeep ahead of the game\u201d in relation to outside bodies\u2019\u2014this was openly declared in internal discussions to be one of the purposes of the stocktaking review in 1991.[CITATION-224] At the same time, officials made efforts to rebuild the department\u2019s credibility in the public eye and among academic experts, especially after the IFS\u2019s discovery of the computation error in the HBAI series in March 1990.[CITATION-225] The public scandal over the error also \u2018made it much harder\u2019 for the DSS to refuse the IFS access to the data, as Bill Barron explained in a note in May 1991.[CITATION-226] DSS officials therefore accepted the need to treat the IFS as a \u2018special case\u2019 and suggested increasing co-operation with the institute as \u2018the best way forward\u2019. And despite deep reservations among officials about a general release of HBAI data,[CITATION-227] the DSS announced in December 1991 that it would grant access to HBAI datasets to external researchers after the publication of each new edition.[CITATION-228] DSS officials were aware that their new-found openness boosted their public image, as it earned the department praise from the IFS.[CITATION-229] In autumn 1991 the DSS eventually agreed to a formal collaboration with the IFS, a milestone in the transformation of the knowledge regime. In early 1991 Andrew Dilnot of the IFS had proposed that the institute could check the next HBAI edition prior to publication. When DSS officials discussed publication plans in October 1991, the advantages and risks of this proposal were carefully weighed up. DSS officials prepared a lengthy paper in which eight different options were classified as low, medium or high risk\u2014a document that reflected the significance of the decision and the political pressures weighing on the department.[CITATION-230] The main arguments in favour of enlisting the co-operation of the IFS were pragmatic: \u2018When they endorse our actions we gain considerably\u2019. In November 1991, the government accepted the proposal, anxious to secure the \u2018goodwill\u2019 of the IFS\u2014and to avoid the \u2018worst-case scenario\u2019 of alienating the IFS and driving it into a formal collaboration with the Social Security Select Committee under Frank Field.[CITATION-231] This was a watershed moment: ever since, the DSS and its successor, the Department of Work and Pensions, have co-produced the HBAI series with the IFS and have shared control over the data with what officials in the DSS used to call \u2018the outside world\u2019. At the IFS, the collaboration was regarded as advantageous because it consolidated the institute\u2019s position in the field and also brought in a continuous stream of funding, as the DSS financed the work.[CITATION-232] For the DSS and its statistics, the collaboration provided fresh legitimacy, but it also limited the government\u2019s scope of action in the politics of statistics and redefined what was sayable about economic inequality in the United Kingdom. All in all, the involvement of external experts was seen as unavoidable, but not necessarily greeted with enthusiasm in the DSS. When the proposal of \u2018contracting out all the HBAI work to IFS\u2019 was briefly floated in the DSS in the summer of 1991, one of the departmental statisticians admitted that the mere idea had the effect of \u2018send[ing] shivers down my spine\u2019.[CITATION-233] The knowledge politics described in this article did not follow any preconceived blueprint, but evolved in a dynamic and interactive process. Nevertheless, contemporaries perceived it as a comprehensive strategy in which statistical policies were only one, albeit important, aspect among others. Activists of the Child Poverty Action Group described it in June 1988 as a \u2018continuing government strategy to marginalise study and debate on poverty/equity issues\u2019 that was not only associated with \u2018increasing inequality\u2019 and \u2018increasing invisibility\u2019 of the poor due to \u2018fewer official statistics\u2019, but also with \u2018pressures on schools curricula; attitude to sociology in higher education; attacks on church leaders, etc.\u2019.[CITATION-234] As this article demonstrates, this strategy was driven by Thatcher and her ministers, but implemented to a large extent by civil servants who phrased the \u2018lines to take\u2019, developed narratives and prepared decisions in the management and communication of official statistics. Meanwhile, special advisors, think tanks, or Conservative party organisations supported the strategy, but left few traces in the extensive DSS records:[CITATION-235] the main protagonists were career civil servants with special expertise in statistics such as Ian Williams, who wrote many of the briefings cited in this article.[CITATION-236] Contrary to popular images, civil servants worked in close partnership with government ministers during the 1980s, a finding that augments Richard Vinen\u2019s recent observation of a \u2018convergence between civil servants and politically appointed advisers\u2019 during the Thatcher era.[CITATION-237] Key officials even indicated their support for the political agenda of the Thatcher government in passing remarks that revealed their personal opinions. For example, the Chief Statistician Deo Ramprakash ridiculed the idea of a European poverty line in an internal note as \u2018Socialism through the back Delors\u2019.[CITATION-238] Similarly, Jeremy Groombridge, who co-ordinated many briefings and decisions as the private secretary of the Secretary of State, scribbled the following comment in the margin of a newspaper article that lamented the lack of \u2018progress\u2019 in the distribution of income since 1979: \u2018what\u2019s \u201cprogress\u201d in this context? More equalising?\u2019[CITATION-239] Thatcherite knowledge politics were part of more wide-ranging efforts to reframe public discourse on poverty, inequality and social class. The impact of these efforts was noticeable, as the IFS analyst Steven Webb observed in a BBC 4 programme on poverty in June 1996: \u2018The agenda has been shifted by the Conservatives over 15 or so years, and they have got across the idea that there is no such thing as poverty, that it\u2019s all just relative poverty, that people are just further behind, but they\u2019ve still got videos and cars and go on foreign holidays. And because that has become so widely accepted, the political pressure to do something about poverty has diminished enormously\u2019.[CITATION-240] Furthermore, Thatcher\u2019s attempts to marginalise discourse on social class aligned with wider trends of popular individualism and the substitution of class identities with notions of \u2018ordinariness\u2019.[CITATION-241] At the same time, the success of these narratives also depended on the reduced availability of official statistics that could have corrected Thatcher\u2019s claims about the blurring of class divisions in Britain. To be sure, the government\u2019s narrative of the trickle-down effect was disputed by experts, opposition spokespersons and NGOs throughout the 1980s.[CITATION-242] However, campaign groups such as the Child Poverty Action Group could not fill the gaps in official statistics as they lacked the access to data that the DSS had \u2018at its fingertips\u2019, and even the statistical experts of CPAG treated government statistics as \u2018facts\u2019, however \u2018unbelievable\u2019 they seemed, especially the controversial claims about the gains of the poorest under Thatcher.[CITATION-243] In the knowledge regime under Thatcher, the debate on poverty was filled with irreconcilable claims and counterclaims: Thatcherite knowledge politics introduced uncertainty into the public debate and thereby marginalised poverty as a political issue. Knowledge politics certainly contributed to the global slump in interest in issues of economic inequality during the 1980s.[CITATION-244] Alongside other actors, discursive strategies and economic ideas that discounted distributive questions,[CITATION-245] knowledge politics helped to pave the way for neo-liberal reforms and the global rise of neo-liberal political economies. As Thomas Piketty has observed, inequality regimes in the era of hypercapitalism have been associated with a lack of \u2018democratic transparency regarding inequalities of income and wealth\u2019; further, he notes that \u2018economic and financial opacity\u2019 has increased in recent years and has been of \u2018paramount importance\u2019 in stifling public debates about rising levels of inequality around the world.[CITATION-246] This article offers an account of how this type of opacity was politically engineered by governments and how it can be challenged by civil society.",
