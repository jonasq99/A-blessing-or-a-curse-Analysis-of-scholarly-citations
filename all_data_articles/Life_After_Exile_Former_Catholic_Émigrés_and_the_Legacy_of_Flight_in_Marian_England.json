    "article": "Over the last twenty years, a wealth of studies on early modern exile movements across Europe have emphasised the many problems experienced by \u00e9migr\u00e9s, in particular when justifying their flight in the eyes of their compatriots back home. However, most of these studies see such difficulties coming to an end upon the return of \u00e9migr\u00e9s to their native lands. Homecoming exiles were supposedly treated as quasi-martyrs for the faith and lauded as heroes. Taking as its case-study those English Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI who returned home following Mary I\u2019s accession, this article challenges the idea that the difficulties of dislocation ended abruptly upon repatriation. It shows that, while on the face of it they were awarded unparalleled levels of patronage for their sacrifices for the faith, being appointed to positions of power and influence within the Marian Church and state, former \u00e9migr\u00e9s continued to grapple with the baggage of exile status long after they set foot on English soil. In this way, this study not only highlights the need to reconsider some recent assessments of the success of the Marian Counter-Reformation, but, more broadly, it suggests that prevailing narratives regarding the heroic homecomings of early modern exiles may be the legacy of the exiles\u2019 own attempts to mitigate the lingering difficulties of dislocation.The study of early modern religious exile has blossomed over the past twenty years. From Portuguese \u2018New Christian\u2019 converts in 1530s Antwerp to the Calvinist \u2018stranger churches\u2019 of Tudor and Stuart England, we now appreciate the extent to which the dislocation and displacement of individuals on confessional grounds became a pan-European, and perhaps even global, phenomenon across the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.[CITATION-1] Nicholas Terpstra, in his, has suggested that such widespread transplantation might even be seen as the defining feature of these centuries, the Reformation standing out as \u2018Europe\u2019s first grand project in social purification\u2019.[CITATION-2] The surge in interest in early modern exile has also afforded historians a far deeper insight into the human experience of displacement, with a number of historians exploring the many difficulties inherent in dislocation. Of particular interest has been the psychological impact of exile. Quite aside from the \u2018deep sense of estrangement and disorientation\u2019 felt by strangers in strange lands, \u00e9migr\u00e9s often had to justify their flight both to themselves and to their compatriots back home.[CITATION-3] Accusations of disloyalty to one\u2019s homeland were often levelled at exiles, spawning sometimes bitter polemical battles over the legitimacy of flight. Christopher Highley has highlighted, for example, the extraordinary lengths gone to by early Elizabethan Catholics on the continent to defend their continued political allegiance to the English queen, despite their aversion to her religious policies.[CITATION-4] These nuanced accounts have enriched our understanding of the difficulties that exiles had to overcome in foreign lands, but the lives of such individuals following their return home remains an underdeveloped theme. The ever-shifting confessional map of early modern Europe meant that religiously motivated exiles were often able to return to their friends and families when religious conditions back home changed in their favour. In sixteenth-century England, for example, a number of English Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9s returned during the reign of Mary I, while just a few years later a large group of Marian Protestant exiles travelled back to England upon Elizabeth I\u2019s accession. Historians have tended to assume that such homecomings signalled the end of the difficulties of dislocation, with returning exiles welcomed back as quasi-martyrs for the faith, lauded by their countrymen, and honoured with lucrative and powerful preferments. Although the exact extent of their influence over the Elizabethan Settlement continues to be debated, most historians have agreed that returning Protestant exiles in the first decade of Elizabeth I\u2019s reign were \u2018eagerly embraced as committed and enthusiastic advocates of the new policy\u2019, and came to dominate the episcopal bench by the mid-1560s.[CITATION-5] As Jonathan Wright has argued, earlier criticisms of these exiles\u2019 decision to leave were all but forgotten upon their homecoming, and they were widely hailed as the \u2018the most obviously brave survivors of Mary\u2019s reign\u2019.[CITATION-6] Geert Janssen has reached similar conclusions in his study of Dutch Catholic refugees who returned to the Spanish-held Netherlands following the religious revolt of the 1570s and 1580s. As Janssen shows, the exiles were acclaimed upon their arrival as heroic martyrs, systematically appointed to vacant offices in town magistracies and the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and helped to regain lost goods and property. Such was their new-found influence that they quickly became \u2018the pioneering forces of a refashioned political and confessional order\u2019.[CITATION-7] This article challenges the idea that the dislocations of exile ended abruptly upon repatriation. It takes as its case-study those Catholics who, having left England during the reigns of Henry VIII and his son Edward VI, returned to their homeland during the brief restoration of Catholicism under Mary I. This group of fifty-five individuals has received comparatively little attention from historians of the English Reformations.[CITATION-8] Apart from a handful of works on individual \u00e9migr\u00e9s, most notably the cardinal-legate Reginald Pole, and one self-acknowledged \u2018preliminary overview\u2019 by Peter Marshall, these exiles as a group remain rather underexplored.[CITATION-9] However, their experience offers an invaluable insight into the process of repatriation for early modern religious refugees. This study traces the fortunes of these \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Marian England from their return home in the mid-1550s to the accession of Elizabeth I. It suggests that, while they were awarded unparalleled levels of patronage for their sacrifices for the faith, they nonetheless continued to grapple with the baggage of exile status long after they set foot on English soil. By analysing references to these exiles in the writings of contemporaries, alongside the fears and concerns apparent in their own letters and orations, I will suggest that the stigma of their previous flight\u2014and particularly the suggestion that they had been disloyal to their homeland\u2014continued to cause them difficulties in their relations with Catholics and Protestants alike. The article explores how, in the face of such criticisms, former exiles may have actively manipulated the memory of their flight so as to dispel the doubts of their compatriots and depict themselves as heroic victims.By focusing on the lives of these \u00e9migr\u00e9s following their repatriation, this study complicates prevailing narratives regarding the heroic homecomings of early modern exiles. Indeed, it suggests that such narratives may themselves be the legacy of \u00e9migr\u00e9 self-fashioning, designed to mitigate the very real difficulties which former exiles continued to face following their return home. The discussion also has particular relevance for the historiography of Marian Catholicism. By highlighting both the importance of former religious \u00e9migr\u00e9s for the direction and functioning of Mary\u2019s Church, and the friction that their exile status created with their compatriots, it adds an important new dimension to our understanding of the internal dynamics of the Marian regime.During the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, more than two hundred English Catholics left the realm on account of their religious beliefs.[CITATION-10] With regards to the fifty-five who later returned to England in Mary I\u2019s reign, there was a fairly even mixture of clerics (14), laypeople (23) and religious (18).[CITATION-11] The majority of this group found refuge in either the Low Countries, particularly the university town of Louvain and the city of Bruges, or Italy, principally around Rome and Padua. Smaller contingents gathered in France and Scotland.[CITATION-12] Such an overview misrepresents, however, the considerable mobility of these \u00e9migr\u00e9s, who communicated and moved between exile centres throughout Europe with remarkable frequency and ease. Richard Hilliard, for example, who had been chaplain to Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall under Henry VIII, left England for Scotland in 1539 and quickly became a high-profile figure in the Scottish Kirk. Nevertheless, he maintained communication with Reginald Pole in Rome, corresponding via another English exile, Henry Elston, who was stationed in Antwerp. By 1543, Hilliard had made his way to join the growing community of English Catholic exiles in the English Hospice in Rome. In 1549, he travelled across Europe with his fellow exile Michael Throckmorton on a papal mission to meet with Protector Somerset in England., he seems to have visited English Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9s residing in both Antwerp and Louvain. By the end of the year, he had been made a papal Penitentiary in Rome.[CITATION-13] Although it is not the purpose of this article to explore the nature of this international community of English Catholic exiles, it is important to note that neither Hilliard\u2019s mobility, nor his active support of Catholicism in both the Scottish and later Roman Church, are unusual in the context of the actions of his fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9s.[CITATION-14] Upon the death of Edward VI and the accession of the Catholic Mary I, these fifty-five \u00e9migr\u00e9s gradually began to return home. On first inspection, it might appear as though they were treated in ways not dissimilar to the repatriated Dutch refugees studied by Janssen\u2014as quasi-martyrs for the faith. In August 1553, Cardinal Girolamo Dandino,to the Imperial Court, relayed to Rome a report he had received from an English agent. This agent had suggested that, although Mary had \u2018the best intentions, she did not have any men in whom she could trust with regards to the returning of the realm to the holy see\u2019.[CITATION-15] In the eyes of the new queen, former exiles seem to have been the answer to this problem\u2014a reserve of heroic and dedicated individuals who had sacrificed everything for the faith, and could therefore be trusted to facilitate the restoration of Catholicism. An anonymous Italian report from England dated 28 January 1555 explained how the queen was minded to call home \u2018that good seed of religious men that are in Brabant\u2019 in order to repopulate the newly refounded religious houses.[CITATION-16] Similarly, a report from the Venetian ambassador to England, Giovanni Micheli, in March 1555 explained how Mary, intent on the \u2018augmentation and diffusion\u2019 of Catholicism throughout her realm, \u2018sent for many English friars of the orders of St. Dominick and St. Francis, who, to escape the past persecutions, withdrew beyond the sea, and lived in poverty in Flanders\u2019.[CITATION-17] With the queen\u2019s support, former exiles came to dominate the Marian Church and government. By the end of her reign, they had collectively accumulated the bishoprics of Coventry and Lichfield, Chichester, Worcester, and St Asaph, along with offers of the bishoprics of Salisbury and Oxford;[CITATION-18] a collection of cathedral prebends in dioceses including Canterbury, Norwich, London, Winchester and Oxford;[CITATION-19] governing positions in the Franciscan convent at Greenwich, the Charterhouse at Sheen, the Dominican nunnery in Dartford, the Bridgettine abbey at Syon and the Dominican priory of St Bartholomew\u2019s in London;[CITATION-20] seats on a number of regional and specific commissions against heresy;[CITATION-21] the headships of two Cambridge colleges;[CITATION-22] a collection of parliamentary seats across the country;[CITATION-23] the position of general secretary to the Privy Council; and control of one of the country\u2019s most important printing presses.[CITATION-24] The most powerful of these former exiles was Reginald Pole, who returned home in late 1554 as cardinal-legate for England, and was quickly appointed archbishop of Canterbury. As Micheli commented in 1557, Mary \u2018wanted Pole\u2019s opinion on all things, and referred everything to him\u2019. Such was his \u2018great and extraordinary authority\u2019 that \u2018one might say that he truly is the king and prince himself\u2019.[CITATION-25] Contemporary accounts of exile homecomings serve to reinforce the notion of religious \u00e9migr\u00e9s being welcomed as returning heroes. In his \u2018Oration in the praise of the Kinge of Spaine\u2019, written in the spring of 1555 but never published, John Boxall, himself a former Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9, explained how, upon Pole\u2019s arrival in London,The road was full with companies of knights, the Thames scattered with boats. No one at any time in this or any other state received greater devotion from men of all ages and rank ... Indeed, if the moderation of his singular nature had not prevented him, Pole might have employed that saying of the famous orator, that it was as if he had been carried home on the shoulders of his country.[CITATION-26] Such accounts were corroborated by foreign observers. Count Langosco da Stroppiana reported to the Bishop of Arras in November 1554 that Pole \u2018was well received by the country people, and he has been the object of many attentions from the lords assembled here for Parliament, several of whom went as far as Dover to welcome him\u2019.[CITATION-27] Other exiles seem to have received more modest, but no less favourable welcomes. The Venetian ambassador Micheli explained in March 1555 how formerly exiled Dominican and Franciscan friars, \u2018showing themselves everywhere in public, are genuinely well met and kindly treated\u2019.[CITATION-28] The new characterisation of returning exiles as stalwart defenders of the faith seems also to have been actively embraced and encouraged by the \u00e9migr\u00e9s themselves. Indeed, several adopted a distinct spiritual elitism in their interactions with stay-at-home compatriots. For example, following a request to Cardinal Pole from the suffragan bishop of Dover, Richard Thornden, for the power to grant absolutions for past sins, Pole\u2019s fellow exile, Thomas Goldwell, sent a long reply on 16 June 1554. Goldwell went into great detail in reminding Thornden of his former lapses from the true faith, recalling how the latter\u2019s apparent willingness to conform with \u2018all maner of euill procedings the which haue these yeares past bene in England\u2019 was such that \u2018men thinke that yet if any newe mutacion ... shoulde chaunce, you woulde bee as ready to chaunge as any other\u2019.[CITATION-29] Although the powers requested were nonetheless granted, Goldwell made a point of emphasising how, though Thornden\u2019s new powers were indeed great, they remained inferior to those of Nicholas Harpsfield, who \u2018hath the lyke, and in one thing more greater then be these your Lordships\u2019.[CITATION-30] Harpsfield had recently been appointed archdeacon of Canterbury by Pole, a position which should have placed him beneath Thornden in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The implication was that the suffragan bishop\u2019s earlier lapses had rendered him less trustworthy than Harpsfield, who, by exiling himself in Louvain for much of Edward VI\u2019s reign, had proved his devotion to the faith and thus his worthiness to wield greater power.[CITATION-31] Such elitism seems to have been shared by those members of Thomas More\u2019s extended family who had exiled themselves in Louvain during the reign of Edward VI and returned home upon Mary\u2019s accession.[CITATION-32] As one of Pole\u2019s agents informed Cardinal Dandino in August 1553, these \u00e9migr\u00e9s believed that, other than Stephen Gardiner, there were \u2018very few men remaining in England both willing and able to advise and assist the queen\u2019 with her religious agenda, all having shown opinions of dubious orthodoxy. Even Gardiner had shown himself consistent \u2018only with respect to the sacraments\u2019.[CITATION-33] Eamon Duffy has noted a similar \u2018barrier of reserve\u2019 between Pole and the older bishops during Mary\u2019s reign, a barrier which stemmed from Pole\u2019s consciousness of such bishops\u2019 earlier lapses into schism.[CITATION-34] This is abundantly clear in a letter from the cardinal to Bishop Gardiner of 22 March 1554. Pole damned the bishop with faint praise for having had the \u2018fortitude to suffer persecution and imprisonment\u2019 during the reign of Edward VI, while nonetheless falling into sin by \u2018having permitted yourself to be separated from the Church\u2019.[CITATION-35] He went on to thank God that at least some individuals (namely the martyred Fisher, More and the Carthusian fathers, but the implicit suggestion is that he was also referring to himself) had been granted \u2018such fortitude of spirit that by neither offers nor threats have they permitted themselves to be brought to separate from the unity of the Church\u2019.[CITATION-36] What is more, Gardiner seems to have readily accepted Pole\u2019s criticisms, \u2018acknowledging [his] own sin\u2019.[CITATION-37] As historians such as Peter Marshall and Eamon Duffy have implied, such \u2018survivor guilt\u2019 may have been felt by many of the leading figures in Mary\u2019s regime who conformed to the Henrician Schism.[CITATION-38] Their encounters with the constancy of former exiles served only to bring their own inconstancy into sharper relief.Despite the apparently wide acceptance of the spiritual superiority of \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and the preferments they enjoyed, life after exile may not have been quite so simple. As has already been suggested, recent work on early modern exile has explored how religious \u00e9migr\u00e9s throughout Europe were often faced with criticisms about their loyalty. As Christopher Highley has explained in relation to late Elizabethan Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9s, \u2018the exiles\u2019 Englishness was suspect in the eyes of Protestants not just because they had left England but also because they had tied their fortunes to foreigners\u2019.[CITATION-39] Those English Catholics who left the realm during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI were particularly vulnerable to such accusations\u2014a consequence of the peculiarly political nature of the early Reformation in England. As Ethan Shagan has commented, following the Break with Rome, \u2018it was the peculiar genius of Henry VIII and his advisors that ... they sought throughout the 1530s totheir Reformation\u2019. Through the effective framing of new legislation (specifically the Treason Act of 1534 and the Act Extinguishing the Authority of the Bishop of Rome of 1536), the Henrician regime succeeded in linking the issue of ecclesiastical authority inextricably with that of political obedience. Opposition to the royal supremacy thus became treason, and maintaining the authority of the \u2018bishop of Rome\u2019 tantamount to transferring one\u2019s allegiance to a foreign prince\u2014a link made clear in the incessant anti-papal rhetoric employed in government-sponsored propaganda throughout the 1530s and 1540s.[CITATION-40] In choosing to leave the realm on account of their religious beliefs, therefore, Catholic exiles showed themselves doubly to be traitors. Not only had they abandoned their homeland, but, in doing so, they had demonstrated that loyalty to the \u2018usurping\u2019 power of the papacy outweighed their loyalty to their \u2018natural\u2019 sovereign. The heinousness of this treachery was made abundantly clear in a barrage of propagandistic royal proclamations and parliamentary acts of attainder. In December 1538, a number of English Catholics beyond the seas were condemned as having \u2018maliciously, falsely, unnaturally, and traitorously renounce[d] their natural prince\u2019, while in 1539 a group of prominent \u00e9migr\u00e9s, including Reginald Pole, Thomas Goldwell and William Peto, were attainted as having \u2018cast off their duty to the king\u2019 and instead having \u2018most traiterously adhered and submitted themselves unto the Bishopp of Rome being a Common Enemy unto your Majestie and this Realme\u2019.[CITATION-41] A later act of attainder, in 1542, condemned Richard Pate and Seth Holland, who had recently exiled themselves in Rome, for having \u2018falsely, malycyously and trayterously\u2019 adhered themselves to the Pope.[CITATION-42] As Stanford E. Lehmberg has suggested, these acts of attainder were effective instruments of propaganda with the potential to reach a wide audience.[CITATION-43] Even the exiles themselves were aware of their image problem\u2014Richard Marshall, the Dominican prior of Newcastle, who fled the realm in late 1535, acknowledged in a letter home to his brethren that \u2018I ame notyde to be non of the Kynges frendes\u2019, even though he \u2018love[d] the kyng as a trew christyn man owght to do\u2019.[CITATION-44] Reginald Pole\u2019s declaration for Rome, and subsequent acceptance of a cardinalate, became a particular point of contention for royal propagandists, especially once news reached England in 1539 of his involvement in a papal scheme to orchestrate a three-pronged invasion by Spain, France and Scotland.[CITATION-45] Richard Morison\u2019s, published that year, explained how Pole, who had once decried the detestable vices of the Italian city, now \u2018hath this always in his mouthe,, Rome is my natiue countrye\u2019. He lamented how the newly created cardinal \u2018forsaketh his countreye, changeth Englande for Rome\u2019 and fought against his true king.[CITATION-46] Morison went even further in his, denouncing Pole as one who \u2018woldest haue drowned thy countrey in bloudde\u2019 and \u2018thoughtest to haue ouerflowed thy Prynce and soueraygne lorde\u2019.[CITATION-47] Little changed upon the accession of Edward VI. In June 1549, Protector Somerset wrote to Pole explaining that, although he had temporarily been swayed by an earlier letter in which the cardinal had seemed to show \u2018respecte unto your naturall Contreye ye were borne in\u2019, he now realised that the truth was \u2018farre otherwise\u2019. Somerset reiterated the regime\u2019s rejection of the Pope\u2019s usurped power and accused Pole of acting more like \u2018a foreine prince\u2019 than a loyal English subject in his determination to defend such a usurper.[CITATION-48] In 1553, a number of Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9s were omitted by name from the king\u2019s general pardon, and placed in a list of those who had committed \u2018any kinde of treason ... fellonie, robberie, wilfull murder, or burglarie\u2019. An inquisition into William Rastell\u2019s absence from his post as Lincoln\u2019s Inn treasurer found him to have \u2018deceitfully and rebelliously\u2019 taken flight to Louvain.[CITATION-49] It was even suggested that the \u00e9migr\u00e9s had themselves become \u2018foreign\u2019\u2014in 1551, a government official warned a young traveller in Italy that he should beware \u2018the subtill Itallian practises\u2019 of the exiled Michael Throckmorton in Rome.[CITATION-50] Protestant polemic aimed at former \u00e9migr\u00e9s played on these same associations throughout Mary\u2019s reign and after. In 1555, an anonymous tract printed by a Protestant exile in Strasbourg highlighted how former Henrician bishops such as Bonner and Tunstall, now conforming under Mary, had once denounced Pole as an \u2018errant traitore ... for his unnaturallnes against his owne countre\u2019. Yet they demonstrated their own \u2018unnaturallnes\u2019 by their decision to support the cardinal and thereby \u2018bringe this hole Realme of England into the hands of strangers\u2019.[CITATION-51] On 1 January 1558, the Protestant cleric Christopher Goodman published from exile in Geneva his. Despite himself providing a number of justifications for resisting \u2018ungodly\u2019 rulers, Goodman criticised the \u2018moste traiterous and pestilent Cardinal Pole\u2019, who had fled the realm and attempted to persuade Charles V \u2018to tourne his power and armie against Kynge Henry the eight and England, this doggs owne contrey\u2019. He also criticised the English people who now welcomed such a man home, \u2018whome before in your lawful kyngs dayes, you moste iustely condemned as a traitour\u2019.[CITATION-52] Another former \u00e9migr\u00e9 to Italy, Michael Throckmorton, was similarly accused by Marian Protestants of having renounced his Englishness.(1556), probably published by Richard Morison in Emden, denounced Throckmorton as a \u2018Curtigiane of Rome\u2019.[CITATION-53] Such opinions even persisted after Mary\u2019s death. In 1572, Matthew Parker, who himself had remained in England throughout the 1550s, recalled how, by choosing exile, Reginald Pole had opted for Italian degeneracy over patriotism and gratitude to his king. It was Parker\u2019s opinion that this Italian sojourn had caused him to undergo \u2018a great and monstrous metamorphosis\u2019, changing \u2018from an Englishman to an Italian\u2019\u2014a transformation nothing short of diabolical.[CITATION-54] John Foxe, in his, similarly regarded Pole as having become overly Italianate, recalling rumours that the cardinal\u2019s death had been hastened by his favouring \u2018some Italian Physicke\u2019 rather than an English doctor, a choice which \u2018did him no good\u2019.[CITATION-55] These sentiments among Protestants may also have had more tangible consequences for returning \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Marian England. In July 1555, Henry Elston, the warden of the Franciscan convent at Greenwich, who had been one of the first Catholics to flee the realm in Henry VIII\u2019s reign, complained to the Lord Treasurer how both he and another friar and former exile, William Peto, \u2018were beaten with stones which were flong at them by diverse lewde personnes as they passed from London to Grenewiche on Sondaye last\u2019.[CITATION-56] Although the motivations of these \u2018lewde personnes\u2019 were never discovered, it is telling that such acts of violence were directed specifically at two former exiles and not the other members of their Franciscan community.That Protestants targeted the supposed disloyalty and \u2018foreignness\u2019 of Catholic exiles is unsurprising. They were, after all, the most visible representatives of the Pope\u2019s \u2018foreign\u2019 and \u2018usurping\u2019 power in England. However, there is evidence to suggest that it was not just adherents of the new faith who might firmly associate returning exiles with disloyalty to the Crown.Sir George Throckmorton, a high-profile conservative in matters of religion, had been periodically in trouble with the English authorities throughout the early 1530s. Although he loyally served the king in the Pilgrimage of Grace, he had earned a distinct reputation for intransigence, even spending a month in the Tower of London in late 1536.[CITATION-57] He was imprisoned once again in October 1537. The immediate occasion of his re-arrest was the appearance of new evidence regarding Throckmorton\u2019s supposed spreading of rumours about the king\u2019s sexual exploits with both the sister and the mother of Anne Boleyn.[CITATION-58] However, as Peter Marshall has suggested, a significant factor in Sir George\u2019s imprisonment was the activities of his exiled brother, Michael.[CITATION-59] Michael had, by 1536, entered the orbit of Reginald Pole in Rome, serving as Pole\u2019s trusted representative and messenger. Throughout 1537, he had worked as the cardinal\u2019s double agent, feeding Thomas Cromwell false information about Pole\u2019s activities until the vicegerent became aware of Throckmorton\u2019s deceptions in September of that year.[CITATION-60] It is thus no surprise that, aware of his own tarnished record and a consequent need to demonstrate loyalty to the king, Sir George denounced his brother in a confession sent to Henry in October. What is striking, however, is the extent to which, in doing so, Sir George appropriated the government\u2019s own rhetoric of disloyalty. He described Michael as \u2018unthriftie and unnaturall\u2019 for having traitorously abandoned the realm, wishing he had never been born and pledging his willingness to hunt both him and Pole down if Henry gave the word.[CITATION-61] Similar appropriation of the rhetoric of anti-exile propaganda can be seen among another prominent group of conformist Catholics in Henry\u2019s reign\u2014the family of Reginald Pole. With every new report of Pole\u2019s strengthening relationship with the papacy in exile came increased political pressure on his family to prove their loyalty to the English king. Following the sending of Pole\u2019sto Henry in 1536\u2014a violent rejection of the Royal Supremacy and an uncompromising affirmation of the Pope\u2019s authority\u2014his mother, Margaret, countess of Salisbury, was placed in a position where she had no choice but to reprimand her son openly in order to protect herself.[CITATION-62] Just like Throckmorton, she employed the government\u2019s own language to do so. Writing to Pole in late 1536, she insisted that his arguments for opposing the king on a \u2018promise made of you to god\u2019 did not stand up. Indeed, that promise \u2018was to serve god and thy prynce whom, if thou doo not serve with all they wytt, with all thy power, I knowe thou can not please god\u2019.[CITATION-63] Pole\u2019s brother, Henry, Lord Montague, similarly expressed his belief that, by fleeing the realm, subjecting himself to the \u2018Bishop of Rome\u2019 and writing such a tract against the king, Pole had shown himself \u2018so unnaturall to so noble a prynce of whom you can not denye next god you have received all thynges\u2019.[CITATION-64] Two years later, following Pole\u2019s acceptance of a cardinal\u2019s hat and suspected involvement in a range of anti-English papal plots, the government launched a direct attack on his family in England. Pole\u2019s brother Geoffrey was arrested and, psychologically broken, implicated other members of the family in what was later presented as a conspiracy to overthrow the king and replace him with Henry Courtenay, marquess of Exeter. Although the \u2018Exeter Conspiracy\u2019 was probably nothing more than a fiction, Pole\u2019s mother was once again compelled to denounce her son, affirming that \u2018full sore it was against her mynd that ever he shold goe beyond [the] sea\u2019.[CITATION-65] Other high-profile conservatives, under similar pressures to denounce Catholic exiles, likewise appropriated the government\u2019s polemic. Despite conforming to the religious alterations of Henry\u2019s reign, Cuthbert Tunstall, bishop of Durham, remained a staunch supporter of traditional doctrine. There was thus a constant need for him to prove his loyalty to the king. When fears about Pole\u2019s supposed attempt to organise an invasion of the realm were current, Tunstall launched a stinging rebuke of the cardinal. He argued that, despite being \u2018a subiecte of this realme ... commen of a noble bloudde\u2019, Pole unnaturally went \u2018aboute fro prince to prince, and from countrey to countreye, to stirre theym to warre agaynst this realme, and to distroy the same, beinge his natiue contrey\u2019.[CITATION-66] Such examples of religious conservatives condemning their co-religionists in exile are clearly testimony to the considerable political pressure on Henrician and Edwardian Catholics who chose to conform. But they also demonstrate the extent to which the association of exile with treachery permeated the English mindset. So ingrained had this association become by the end of Edward\u2019s reign that, even after Mary came to the throne and such political pressures dissipated, it continued to colour encounters between former \u00e9migr\u00e9s and former conformists.One area in which this can be seen is in debates over the confiscated property of former exiles. This subject seems to have been a particularly contentious one in Marian England. A bill was introduced into parliament in October 1555, \u2018for punishment of those such as being gone into parts beyond the sea shall contemptuously remain there\u2019. It argued that such fugitives (that is, Protestant exiles in Zurich, Geneva and Frankfurt) should suffer confiscation of their property. The subsequent reading of the bill in the Commons in November and December aroused violent debate\u2014John Perrot became so enraged that he drew his dagger. It was ultimately defeated, although, as Paul Cavill has demonstrated, the government found other ways to enforce its will in this regard.[CITATION-67] The passionate debate and the defeat of the bill has usually been read in terms of sympathy for Protestant exiles among the Commons, together with concerns about \u2018the freedom of the individual\u2019 and the \u2018law-mindedness\u2019 of the English people.[CITATION-68] However, it also needs to be seen in the context of former Catholic exiles\u2019 concerns over the restitution of their own lands and chattels, and lingering notions of their supposed political disloyalty.Forfeiture of both land and goods had been used by Edward VI\u2019s government against several Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9s. As the chronicler Charles Wriothesley wrote on 7 February 1550,This daye allso the houses of Anthony Bonvise, Doctor [John] Clement, phisition, Balthasar, surgeon, and Rastall, which maryed Doctor Clementes daughter, were seassed by the sheriffes of London to the Kinges use because they had fled the realme and conveyed theyr cheife substance and goodes out of the realme, which persons were ranke Papistes.[CITATION-69] In 1555, the same year as the exile property bill was introduced into parliament, this \u2018Doctor Clement\u2019, who had spent the majority of Edward VI\u2019s reign in Louvain before returning home following Mary\u2019s accession, submitted a series of bills to the court of Chancery. He sought to recover his confiscated London properties and goods contained therein. However, they had been sold to a number of private individuals, including Alban Hill, a member of the royal college of physicians, Sir John York, a wealthy trader in the Company of Merchant Adventurers, and Lady Elizabeth Wingfield, the widow of Sir Anthony Wingfield (who had died in 1552).[CITATION-70] Similar bills were submitted by Clement\u2019s fellow Louvain exile, William Rastell, who sought to recover property now in the hands of Sir Thomas White, Lord Mayor of London.[CITATION-71] Significantly, Rastell was returned as MP for Canterbury in the same parliament as the bill for confiscation of \u00e9migr\u00e9 goods was debated.[CITATION-72] In their attempts to counter these bills, the defendants played heavily upon the association of exile with disloyalty. Alban Hill alleged that Clement had forfeited any right to the property in question because he had departed the realm \u2018in contempte of the said late kynges [i.e. Edward\u2019s] Lawes and Statutes\u2019. Furthermore, he made a point of highlighting how Clement had fled to \u2018the towne of Lovynge\u2019\u2014implying that the \u00e9migr\u00e9 had betrayed his country by transferring allegiance to a foreign prince.[CITATION-73] Such a suggestion was made even more explicit by White in his defence against William Rastell. White argued that Rastell \u2018with all his famely againste his allegiance to the saide late kynge ... ded flee and withdraw hym self and wente oute of the Realme into the parties byonde the se\u2019.[CITATION-74] Such arguments, in varying forms, were used by all the defendants.[CITATION-75] Significantly, none of these individuals were ardent Protestants. On the contrary, several appear to have been among the most committed of Catholics. While we have no direct indication of Hill\u2019s religious beliefs, his friendship with the highly conservative John Caius, his earlier education in the University of Bologna, and his rise to prominence in the royal college of physicians under Mary all suggest a man of distinctly Catholic sympathies.[CITATION-76] Sir Thomas White, a \u2018loyal supporter to Queen Mary\u2019, had come to Mary\u2019s aid during Wyatt\u2019s rebellion and sat on the commission for the trial of Thomas Cranmer. In February 1567, the future Jesuit Edmund Campion would read his funeral oration.[CITATION-77] Even if we accept that the defendants in these cases may not necessarily have believed their own accusations\u2014that they were merely putting forward any defence they could think of to keep hold of the property in question\u2014their recourse to the language of disloyalty in a series of apparently separate cases is significant. It suggests that the idea that former \u00e9migr\u00e9s had betrayed their country was fairly common currency in Marian England, and attests to the success of earlier Henrician and Edwardian propaganda among Protestants and Catholics alike.[CITATION-78] More evidence of the enduring success of Henrician and Edwardian polemic in linking exiles with disloyalty can be seen in Cardinal Pole\u2019s relations with his compatriots. Lingering suspicions of Pole\u2019s political disloyalty certainly seem to have inflected debates within the Church and government over his return to England at the beginning of the new queen\u2019s reign. Despite his appointment as legate to his homeland as early as 5 August 1553, Pole\u2019s readmission was discussed and delayed until November of the following year. The principal cause of this delay was the deep-seated concern among the Marian establishment and Church hierarchy over the legate\u2019s obstinacy on the issue of former monastic property, much of which was now in powerful lay hands. However, other factors were also important, including a desire not to jeopardise Mary\u2019s still fragile hold on power until she had consolidated her position, and an uncertainty over the willingness of the English people to accept the papacy after two decades of intense and unrelenting anti-papal rhetoric.[CITATION-79] Implicit in the last of these factors was the enduring idea that, by deserting his country for Rome, Pole had demonstrated a firmer allegiance to the Pope than to his rightful sovereign. This much is clear from a letter of John Masone, the English ambassador in Brussels (and Pole\u2019s friend), written to Mary in May 1554. In the context of the discussions over the cardinal\u2019s repatriation, Masone explained that, although he personally believed \u2018there is not a better english hart within the Realme\u2019, this was not an opinion held universally at home. He expressed his fervent wish therefore that \u2018the hole Realme know him as ... I doo and had that opynnion of him as in effect all estates of Christendome have\u2019.[CITATION-80] Similar issues may have hindered the repatriation of less high-profile former \u00e9migr\u00e9s. In December 1553, Thomas Goldwell was detained in Calais by Lord William Howard. Writing to the Council, Howard explained that, since \u2018the said Goldwell came from Cardinal poole\u2019 in Rome, he had \u2018thought it not meit to permitt him to passe in to england\u2019.[CITATION-81] The \u2018barrier of reserve\u2019 between former exiles and their compatriots has already been noted in relation to the \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u2019 consciousness of the conformists\u2019 lapses into schism; however, it seems that the mistrust cut both ways.The strongest evidence for the continued association of former exiles with disloyalty in Marian England comes, in fact, from their own speeches and writings. Whenever they addressed their compatriots, \u00e9migr\u00e9s seem to have been concerned to reassure them that they were, and had always been, loyal English citizens. In 1554, John Cawood printed a text entitledThis tract, presented as \u2018a speech to the most prudent senate [Parliament] of England\u2019, was supposedly written by Jodocus Harchius, a Netherlandish humanist and religious controversialist.[CITATION-82] However, as Thomas Mayer has argued, both the tone and style suggest that it was more likely written, or at least instigated, by Cardinal Pole himself.[CITATION-83] It declared that, if the cardinal were recalled home,ye shal not hereby cal in a foreigner, who may introduce some barbarous and wild maner of living, but your own countryman, but an Englishman, fitted as wel to your customes, as maner of life; and who, according to the highly commendable custom of the English, shineth more in liberality than covetousnes, and allureth rather by humanity than severity.[CITATION-84] Pole echoed this same message to parliament immediately following his return, describing at length how, despite his long absence from the realm, his heart continued to beat like a true Englishman. He repeatedly emphasised how he was \u2018one of your owne naturall countreymen, one of your owne body, one of your owne fleashe and blood, and one of your owne brethren\u2019.[CITATION-85] He detailed the pain his exile from his natural land had caused him: \u2018nothing is more grievous to the herte of man then to bee exiled from his native countrey, and thereby to susteyne the perpetuall lacke and deprivacion of his moste swete kinsfolkes\u2019. \u2018Was not this\u2019, he asked, \u2018a piteous state, and a state of extreme calamitee?\u2019[CITATION-86] He certainly seems to have got the message across. Simon Renard, reporting to the Emperor after having heard the speech, suggested that the cardinal had been especially glad to accept the legateship to England \u2018in order to show the realm that he had not forgotten his mother-country\u2019.[CITATION-87] It is interesting to note the stark contrast in which such sentiments stand to those he had expressed in an earlier letter to Protector Somerset in October 1549. In response to claims that he preferred Rome to England and had therefore betrayed his natural prince, he explained that \u2018one who changes his profession, status and country, as is the case with myself, is no longer subject [to their former sovereign]\u2019.[CITATION-88] Other former \u00e9migr\u00e9s supported Pole\u2019s claims, perhaps seeking simultaneously to allay suspicions surrounding their own flight from the realm. John Boxall, in his aforementioned \u2018Oration in the praise of the Kinge of Spaine\u2019, compared the cardinal to the Greek lawyer Hermodorus, who was sent into exile by the Ephesians, not because he had done anything wrong, but rather because he was the \u2018foremost of citizens\u2019, and had highlighted the failings of his fellow countrymen.[CITATION-89] Boxall went on to explain how \u2018nothing harsher befell the glory and estimation of this most noble kingdom in our memory than that it was without that citizen whose virtue all foreigners and foreign men loved and were amazed by\u2019. Far from being a foreign traitor, therefore, Pole was presented as the greatest of all Englishmen.[CITATION-90] Nicholas Harpsfield, another former exile, reiterated this sentiment in his unpublished \u2018Treatise on the Pretended Divorce\u2019, composed late in Mary\u2019s reign. Recounting the cardinal\u2019s activities in the 1549/50 papal conclave, he explained how, although it had been within his grasp, Pole had refused the papacy on account of the \u2018fatherly, tender love he bare to this his native country, whose reformation he desired of all other things, and would reserve himself free ... to help forward in his own person that holy work and business of our reformation\u2019.[CITATION-91] Quite how widespread these doubts over the exiles\u2019 national loyalties were in Marian England is difficult to gauge with any precision. However, we can gain a rough indication of their diffusion from the intended audiences of the exiles\u2019 attempts to allay suspicions. Pole\u2019s 1554 speech to parliament was delivered to \u2018al the three estates\u2019 of clergy, nobility and commoners at Westminster.[CITATION-92] The speech later appeared in vernacular print in John Elder\u2019s 1555, and its content was disseminated further through Stephen Gardiner, who was reported to have summarised the speech in writing for those who had not been able to hear it.[CITATION-93] The 1554 oration of Jodocus Harchius, in which the cardinal probably had a hand, was directed towards \u2018the most prudent senate of England\u2019 and published in Latin by John Cawood, suggesting a sizeable, though exclusively elite, audience.[CITATION-94] Both Boxall and Harpsfield\u2019s tracts exist only in manuscript, though it seems likely, given their tone and content, that they were circulated at court and perhaps among the Church hierarchy. These circumstances do suggest that a significant proportion of the governing elite of both Church and state may have continued to doubt the loyalty of former exiles during Mary\u2019s reign. How far such beliefs permeated down the social ladder is even more unclear. However, the apparent success of Henrician and Edwardian propaganda in styling Catholic exiles as \u2018unnatural\u2019 traitors who had transferred their allegiance to the \u2018usurping\u2019 foreign power of the papacy, in combination with the pervasive xenophobia attested to by countless foreign observers in Marian England, does suggest the possibility of widespread mistrust of returning exiles.[CITATION-95] It seems, then, that former exiles may have had a significant image problem in Marian England; what remains to be seen is whether they launched any concerted effort to tackle it. The simple claims to loyalty made by several of these \u00e9migr\u00e9s have already been discussed, but it seems unlikely that such statements could have reversed the achievements of twenty years\u2019 worth of government-sponsored propaganda overnight. Some former \u00e9migr\u00e9s were, however, prepared to go further in attempting to prove their loyalty to England.In his \u2018Treatise on the Pretended Divorce\u2019, Nicholas Harpsfield recounted the story of the two Observant friars, Henry Elston and William Peto, who had been among the very first individuals to flee the realm during the reign of Henry VIII. He explained how, in March 1532, Peto had given a sermon in which he compared the king to Ahab, the biblical ruler who gave \u2018ear to the false prophets\u2019, fearing that Henry too would \u2018incur his unhappy end\u2019 unless he returned to his lawful wife. A week later, Elston defended and repeated Peto\u2019s sentiments, interrupting the king\u2019s chaplain in the middle of his Palm Sunday sermon.[CITATION-96] From other sources we know that, following this debacle, Elston and Peto were both arrested in April. They were initially imprisoned in Lambeth Palace under the custody of Bishop Henry Standish.[CITATION-97] However, Standish proved to be an incompetent, or perhaps a collusive, jailer. He allowed the friars to have great access to sympathetic religious conservatives such as Sir George Throckmorton and the vicar of the Greenwich convent, William Curzon.[CITATION-98] As a result, Cromwell appears to have had the two Observants moved elsewhere. Elston was being kept under guard by the Conventual Franciscans of Bedford by the end of May, while Peto\u2019s whereabouts are unknown.[CITATION-99] Both friars were apparently still in prison on 29 September.[CITATION-100] The next record of Peto is his arrival at the Franciscan convent at Pontoise on 10 January 1533, and both he and Elston were in the convent at Antwerp by June.[CITATION-101] The circumstances surrounding their flight abroad are therefore hazy\u2014they may have been released from prison and subsequently departed the realm, or they may have managed to escape their captors. Either way, it is clear that their departure was not authorised: the English government went to great lengths to track their movements and activities abroad, hoping to bring them back home. Having been alerted to their presence in Antwerp by the English Merchant Adventurer chaplain, John Coke, Cromwell commissioned a report on their activities from William Lok, a London mercer who had travelled to Antwerp in July 1533.[CITATION-102] In October, another English merchant, Stephen Vaughan, denounced Peto as \u2018a tyger cladd in a shepes skyn\u2019, and announced his intention to Cromwell to \u2018work what I can\u2019 in order to \u2018get hym by any polycie\u2019.[CITATION-103] Harpsfield\u2019s account of the pair\u2019s activities in the wake of their \u2018lewd\u2019 sermons completely glossed over their illicit flight from the realm, instead simply claiming that Elston and Peto, \u2018were the first that at the commencement of the schism were banished and exiled\u2019, just as they were the first \u2018that were called home\u2019 in Mary\u2019s reign.[CITATION-104] The use of the term \u2018banished\u2019 seems significant here. In Henrician and Edwardian England, \u2018banishment\u2019 did not feature as a specific punishment in common law, although it was occasionally used on anbasis against those deemed to be foreign subjects.[CITATION-105] Banishment was inflicted on native offenders in this period by judges of Star Chamber who had more flexibility than their common law counterparts in devising new punishments.[CITATION-106] However, banishment, informal or otherwise, certainly does not seem to have been applied to any Henrician or Edwardian Catholic exiles. Indeed, Henry VIII had explicitly ruled out such a punishment for disobedient subjects when it had been suggested to him by the French king in August 1535. It was, Henry argued, \u2018neyther thoffice of a frende nor of a brother\u2019 to \u2018counsaile the kynges hyghnes to banysshe his traytours into straunge partes where they myght have good occasion tyme place and oportunyte to worke their feates of treason and conspiracie the better agaynst the kinges highnes and this his realme\u2019.[CITATION-107] The term \u2018banished\u2019 was, admittedly, used more broadly in a non-legal sense at this time. However, in all these situations, it seems to have retained strong associations with violent and forced expulsion. The authors of, better known as the Bishops\u2019 Book, explained that, after the fall of Adam, mankind was \u2018exiled and banysshed out of heuen\u2019, while fervent evangelicals used the term to describe the forcible removal of \u2018all idolatrie and false religion\u2019 from English churches.[CITATION-108] Despite a lack of stable definition, contemporary usage of the word \u2018banishment\u2019 does therefore suggest that this term was generally understood to imply a forced and unwilling ejection from town, court or country. Moreover, a difference between banishment and self-imposed exile seems to have been understood by contemporaries. John Christopherson, himself a Catholic exile during Edward\u2019s reign, drew the clear distinction in 1554 between a heretic who chose to \u2018flie out of his countrye, because he wyll contynewe in heresye\u2019, and one who \u2018is banished for the same\u2019.[CITATION-109] Given these sixteenth-century understandings of the word, Harpsfield\u2019s description of Elston and Peto as \u2018banished\u2019 men is surprising.[CITATION-110] He may simply have been mistaken, but this seems rather unlikely. As archdeacon of Canterbury during Mary\u2019s reign, Harpsfield would almost certainly have come into contact with Elston and Peto, both of whom rose to national significance following the 1555 reinstatement of the Greenwich Observants.[CITATION-111] Furthermore, he explicitly noted how much of his information \u2018my self have heard the said father Elstow report\u2019.[CITATION-112] It seems probable, therefore, that the description of Elston and Peto as banished men was a conscious decision either by Harpsfield or the two friars themselves.Harpsfield was not the only former \u00e9migr\u00e9 in Mary\u2019s reign to describe exile in this way. In his speech to parliament of late 1554, Cardinal Pole similarly introduced himself as a \u2018banished man\u2019.[CITATION-113] This was no mere slip of the tongue. He referred throughout his oration to the \u2018time of my banishement\u2019.[CITATION-114] Moreover, the cardinal made it abundantly clear what he intended by this term: namely, that the choice to become an exile had not been his own, but one forced upon him, and one which he endured unwillingly for over twenty years. He styled himself as having been \u2018deprived of my native countrey\u2019 without \u2018any meanes to recover any parte of the same\u2019. As he asked the assembled lords, \u2018could not such a state bee but moste greffull and lamentable, as in veraie deede my state was all that time to me\u2019?[CITATION-115] This exact message can be found in the parliamentary oration of Jodocus Harchius, in which Pole was described as a man \u2018forbidden ... to come into his own country, and banished ... from the house of his fathers\u2019.[CITATION-116] As in the case of Elston and Peto, Pole\u2019s claims to have been banished represent a distinct bending of the truth. Pole had been granted permission to leave England to study abroad at the beginning of 1532. Relations between him and the king remained cordial for several years after this point, and he retained his ecclesiastical benefices.[CITATION-117] The relationship did sour after Pole sent his unashamedly criticalto Henry in the summer of 1536. But he was not banished as a result\u2014a fact of which he was well aware.[CITATION-118] In a letter to the king and his council in February 1537, Pole asked the lords rhetorically, \u2018what cause ys there thatt so meny yeares I am owt off my contrye? Am I a banyshyd man?\u2019 On the contrary, he explained, he had been implored to remain in England, and had even been offered the archbishopric of York. However, he could not bring himself to watch the king \u2018whome I loued aboue all other to faull to suche dyshonour\u2019 as a result of his actions, particularly the executions of More and Fisher. The love he felt for Henry, and his horror at the dishonour the king had brought upon himself, was \u2018one the pryncypall causes that made me conten[t to b]e absent from my contrye\u2019.[CITATION-119] It might be argued that these claims to banishment stem from the act of attainder passed against the \u00e9migr\u00e9s in 1539. This act effectively condemned the \u00e9migr\u00e9s to death, confiscating all their rights and privileges as English citizens and thereby making a safe return home impossible.[CITATION-120] However, the attainder was passed several years after they had all voluntarily left the realm. Moreover, Peto and Elston\u2019s inclusion in the act seems to have been prompted largely because the pair had unlawfully left the realm in the first place. Even if we accept that attainder might have been considered a \u2018banishment\u2019 by the standards of the time, this does not explain why these \u00e9migr\u00e9s collectively chose to define themselves by this imposed barrier to re-entry rather than by their original,decision to leave.Why then did all these former \u00e9migr\u00e9s choose to remodel their histories in such a way? Could this have been intended to dispel further lingering suspicions regarding their foreign connections and their allegiance to the English Crown? Indeed, by emphasising that they had been banished from the realm rather than fleeing voluntarily, they absolved themselves of any agency in their initial decision to leave. As a result, their loyalty to the realm could not be questioned: they appeared as heroic victims of an unjust injunction, rather than as traitors who had willingly abandoned their country and co-religionists. If anything, an emphasis upon banishment suggested that they had complied with their natural sovereign\u2019s orders, however unfair, rather than seeking to subvert them.Similar \u2018myths of banishment\u2019 were employed in Marian England by \u00e9migr\u00e9s not included on any Henrician or Edwardian bills of attainder. In the latter half of the seventeenth century, the English Jesuit Christopher Grene composed a biographical portrait of Thomas Vavasour, an English physician who rose to fame as a Catholic recusant under Elizabeth. Grene explained how the doctor \u2018was forced to fly, and was banished his country in King Edward\u2019s days, through the malice of heretics, who suborned one Mr [John] Cheek, schoolmaster to King Edward, to procure his banishment\u2019.[CITATION-121] While it is clear that Vavasour had expressed, quite vocally, his dissatisfaction with the state of religion in Edwardian England, and probably sought refuge abroad as a result, there is no evidence to support the suggestion that he was banished from the realm.[CITATION-122] On the contrary, there survives among the Lansdowne manuscripts a letter from Vavasour to the secretary of state William Cecil, dated 23 October 1551. The letter notes that, as a result of his desire to take to \u2018foreign nations with the sole view of pursuing the practice of Medicine\u2019, \u2018trifling rumours\u2019 had been spread that he was of suspect religion. Vavasour\u2019s letter suggests that the \u2018most illustrious knight, Dr John Cheke\u2019, far from procuring his expulsion, would vouch for his loyalty. The fact was that, \u2018in whatever nation I am, in the business of my homeland and Prince I will retain the right spirit and even give my life if circumstance demanded\u2019. Vavasour ended by asking Cecil for his support in procuring a licence for his departure from the realm to further his study.[CITATION-123] And indeed, among Cecil\u2019s memoranda for February 1552 are notes detailing the provision of a licence for \u2018Vavasor\u2019 to \u2018pass the realm\u2019.[CITATION-124] By December 1553, he had graduated MD at Venice.[CITATION-125] Quite where Grene obtained his information as to Vavasour\u2019s fictitious \u2018banishment\u2019 from the realm is unclear, since he gives no indication of his sources. Grene may of course have embroidered Vavasour\u2019s story himself, in order to make it conform more neatly to the unashamedly martyrological narrative he was compiling. However, it is equally possible, given the evidence of similar myths propagated by exiles, that he was accurately retelling a narrative retrospectively fashioned by Vavasour himself.It is impossible to know with certainty whether or not these former exiles described themselves as \u2018banished men\u2019 in a conscious effort to quell suspicions regarding their loyalty. But it is interesting to note that English Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9s were not unique among contemporaries in using such a strategy. As Christina Garrett suggested almost eighty years ago, Marian Protestant exiles, although they almost all left England voluntarily and without compulsion, developed on the continent their own \u2018legend of persecution and banishment\u2019. Faced with mistrustful foreign hosts with whom they sought refuge, these \u00e9migr\u00e9s too styled themselves as \u2018die armen vertrybnen Engellender\u2019 (\u2018poor banished Englishmen\u2019), hoping thereby to engender sympathy and succour.[CITATION-126] Perhaps these exiled Protestants had learnt a trick or two from their repatriated Catholic counterparts?From the evidence presented above, it appears that suspicions of disloyalty attendant upon unlawful flight from Henrician and Edwardian England continued to hang over the heads of former exiles in Mary\u2019s reign. Such concerns were shared by Protestants and Catholics alike. Furthermore, they appear to have been of sufficient weight for exiles to attempt conscious rewriting of their pasts in order to minimise the traitorous implications of their unlicensed departures. It is interesting to note here that the sensitivity of these Marian Catholics over the issue of their political loyalty may have directly inspired similar concerns among their Elizabethan successors. Of the fifty-five Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9s who returned to England during Mary\u2019s reign, twenty-eight would once again leave their homeland following Elizabeth\u2019s accession.[CITATION-127] The majority of them eventually came to reside in the Spanish Netherlands, in particular in Louvain, where they were joined by a new generation of Catholic exiles in the early 1560s. The issue of loyalty was a burning one for these \u2018Louvainists\u2019. In a steady stream of polemical works throughout the 1560s they repeatedly insisted that, despite their exile, they remained both obedient subjects of the new queen and committed Englishmen.[CITATION-128] Such concerns may well have been inspired, or at least intensified, by the prior difficulties of the twenty-eight \u2018double exiles\u2019. At the very least, we can be sure that these \u00e9migr\u00e9s discussed their experiences with the new generation; one of the principal Louvainist authors, Thomas Stapleton, noted his conversations with both John Clement and William Rastell in his triple biography of Thomas the Apostle, Thomas Becket and Thomas More, first published in 1588.[CITATION-129] The evidence produced in this article adds a significant new dimension to our understanding of the internal dynamics of Mary I\u2019s reign. Over the past three decades, a number of historians have attempted to revise earlier, excessively pessimistic, interpretations of the Marian Church. Jennifer Loach was the first of these, challenging the view that the Marian regime failed \u2018to understand the importance of printing\u2019.[CITATION-130] Her argument was developed by William Wizeman, who suggested that, through the effective use of print, the Marian Church succeeded in defining and disseminating a dynamic and creative theology and spirituality which exhibited \u2018a significant degree of coherence and uniformity\u2019.[CITATION-131] John Edwards and Elizabeth Evenden have recently highlighted the significance of the clergymen who accompanied Philip II to England in 1554 for inspiring Catholic renewal: men such as Fray Bartolome Carranza, Pedro de Soto and Juan de Villagarcia served as conduits into the realm for reformed Spanish spirituality.[CITATION-132] My own work on the cathedral clerics of Mary\u2019s reign has suggested the extent to which a unified, reformed and proto-Tridentine understanding of Catholicism prevailed among her higher clergy, inspiring them to take an active and principled stand against the Elizabethan religious settlement in the 1560s.[CITATION-133] Reassessment of the Marian Church reached its pinnacle in Eamon Duffy\u2019s(2008). Duffy not only attempted a bold reappraisal of the Marian campaign against heresy, suggesting that it may have been considerably more successful than historians have been willing to believe, but also proposed that, in its \u2018heightened interiority\u2019, \u2018more intense sacramentalism\u2019 and \u2018more ardent reverence for the papacy\u2019, Mary\u2019s Church went a long way towards \u2018inventing\u2019 the Counter-Reformation in England.[CITATION-134] Yet the fact that returning exiles may have been met with considerable suspicion by their compatriots, despite their influence and power in Marian England, adds an important dimension to these recent historiographical developments. It alerts us to the possibility of considerably more friction within the Marian Church and government hierarchy than has previously been recognised. Not only did returning \u00e9migr\u00e9s mistrust their compatriots for their former lapses into schism, but these erstwhile schismatics reciprocated the mistrust, suspecting the former exiles of disloyalty to the English Crown. There are notable parallels here with former Protestant exiles in Elizabethan England. Although they were undeniably outwardly favoured by the Elizabethan regime, as historians such as Andrew Pettegree and Jonathan Wright have acknowledged, some recent studies have highlighted tensions between returning Protestant exiles and their stay-at-home compatriots as a significant feature of the 1560s and 1570s. As Karl Gunther has demonstrated, former exiles consistently reminded their compatriots of their conformity under Mary, and criticised them for it, producing or translating a series of specifically anti-Nicodemite texts across the first half of Elizabeth\u2019s reign.[CITATION-135] Similarly, Anne Overell has recently suggested that returning Protestant exiles may also have aroused antagonisms over their supposed \u2018foreignness\u2019.[CITATION-136] When such tensions coalesced with doctrinal disagreement, as they did in the Vestiarian Controversy of 1565\u20136, the stability of the Elizabethan religious settlement could be threatened.[CITATION-137] In noting such a parallel, the question arises of whether the tensions between former Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9s and their conformist compatriots threatened the Marian clergy\u2019s ability to effect a successful Counter-Reformation in England. The recent historiography would seem to suggest quite the opposite. Indeed, rather than their divisions, a number of historians have emphasised the unity of the Marian clergy. Wizeman has suggested that part of the strength of Mary\u2019s religious programme stemmed from the \u2018predominantly uniform theology and spirituality\u2019 expounded by its apologists\u2014a uniformity which existed in spite of differences in age and experience.[CITATION-138] Duffy, too, has commented upon the remarkable degree of \u2018clerical unanimity\u2019 in rallying in defence of the faith evinced by the Marian clergy after Elizabeth\u2019s accession.[CITATION-139] This article has highlighted how such unanimity was achieved in the face of considerable social and cultural obstacles. The success of the Marian restoration is testimony to the remarkable ability of its key activists to unite, putting their suspicions to one side for the sake of the faith. Of course, whether such unanimity would have lasted had Mary and Pole lived beyond 1558 must remain an open question.This article also raises important questions for the study of dislocation and displacement in the early modern period more broadly. If religious \u00e9migr\u00e9s throughout Europe continued to endure some of the stigma of their former exile following their repatriation, how are we to account for the prevalence of the heroic homecoming narrative in exile historiography? In the case of returning Catholics in Marian England, it may well be that the exiles\u2019 own attempts to subvert such lingering stigmas have influenced the way they were remembered by subsequent generations of historians. Certainly, the myth of banishment propagated by a number of these former \u00e9migr\u00e9s has proven remarkably persistent. Following Nicholas Harpsfield\u2019s misleading assertion that the Franciscan friars William Peto and Henry Elston were \u2018banished\u2019 in Henry VIII\u2019s reign, Nicholas Sanders explained that Elston and Peto were \u2018ordered to leave England immediately\u2019 in his 1585.[CITATION-140] Almost three hundred years later, James Anthony Froude suggested of the pair that, since they had been found \u2018hopelessly unrepentant and impracticable\u2019 by the English government, \u2018it was found necessary to banish them\u2019.[CITATION-141] Even modern historians have unintentionally propagated this myth, with one scholar suggesting in 2005 that, following their imprisonment, \u2018Elston and Peto were released and sent into exile\u2019.[CITATION-142] Scholars of exile during the Reformation need to become more aware of the extent to which \u00e9migr\u00e9s themselves may have had agency in shaping not only their lives, but also their afterlives.",
