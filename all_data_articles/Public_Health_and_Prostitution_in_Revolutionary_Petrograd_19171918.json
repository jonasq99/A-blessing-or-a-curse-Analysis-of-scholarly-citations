    "article": "The February revolution of 1917 brought about the complete collapse of the tsarist autocracy and offered multiple possibilities for the reorganisation of society based on new principles of democracy, equality and citizenship. Amid societal reconfiguration, the tsarist system for the regulation of prostitution was repealed in July 1917. After this, the Provisional Government and later the Bolshevik Party looked for new methods to prevent the spread of venereal diseases (VD), which had reached epidemic proportions. The regulation of prostitution had been the tsarist government\u2019s main form of VD control and it was frequently attacked by commentators across the political spectrum on both medical and moral grounds in the decades preceding February 1917. Therefore, its abolition was a political project that was interconnected with broader discourses of liberation and efforts to rid society of the unwanted remnants of the old regime. Physicians rallied around the issue of prostitution, and its eternal bedfellow VD, as part of their broader efforts to dominate the public health agenda of the new revolutionary state. In the Russian capital of Petrograd, the February revolution did not disrupt well-established class or gender stereotypes, which had profound implications for the way in which medical professionals and the police dealt with the issues of prostitution and VD. This article examines how experts, state bureaucrats and the police approached prostitution and VD in Petrograd throughout 1917 and 1918. In doing so, it traces continuities in administrative-bureaucratic regimes and informal policing practices across collapsing regimes and governments in revolutionary Russia.In June 1917, the Union of Naval Doctors in Petrograd convened a meeting to discuss a matter of grave importance. Incidence of venereal diseases (VD) had been rising sharply in the Navy since the outbreak of the\u00a0First World War, but now the \u2018revolutionary anarchy [provided] fertile soil for mass contamination and the rampant spread of infection\u2019.[CITATION-1] The Union of Naval Doctors\u2019 concern was not unfounded, as rates of VD had reportedly reached epidemic proportions in the city of Petrograd by the\u00a0summer\u00a0of 1917.[CITATION-2] The \u2018revolutionary anarchy\u2019 that they cited referred to the period following the revolution of February 1917, a series of events of seismic importance that brought about the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, the end of the 300-year reign of the Romanov dynasty, and the complete collapse of the tsarist autocracy.[CITATION-3] In Petrograd, two centres of power emerged to replace the tsarist government: the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet, which uneasily shared authority until the October Revolution. The period between February and October 1917 was marked by a series of successive crises over political power, economic supply, chronic food shortages, war, epidemic disease and rising crime, as well as the widespread mobilisation of various segments of the urban population against the conditions and options offered to them by political elites.[CITATION-4] The rampant spread of VD within the city of Petrograd and the nearby garrison added another layer to the potent atmosphere of crisis in the capital.The collapse of the old regime in February 1917 offered multiple possibilities for the reorganisation of society, as well as the destruction of the symbols and institutions of the tsarist era. Soldiers ripped the epaulettes from officers\u2019 shoulders, the imperial eagle was torn down in public places, and the tsarist police were attacked, disarmed and dissolved.[CITATION-5] In the midst of this societal reconfiguration, the tsarist system for the regulation of prostitution was repealed in July 1917. Regulation had been introduced in 1843 as a method for preventing the spread of VD. Under the system, women engaged in prostitution had to register with the police, attend regular gynaecological examinations, and abide by a whole host of restrictions governing their visibility and behaviour.[CITATION-6] Before 1917, regulation was criticised by commentators across the political spectrum for promoting extramarital sex, exacerbating the sexual double standard, failing to prevent the spread of VD, and encouraging police interference in the lives of lower-class women. Therefore, the abolition of regulation was of great symbolic significance, both for its vocal opponents and for public health experts who seized the opportunity to propose alternative strategies for combatting VD in the months that followed. Despite this radical change, pre-revolutionary practices for policing prostitution continued in Petrograd and other cities throughout 1917 and beyond. The Provisional Government gave public health experts opportunities to formulate new, radical policies in the field of VD control and prevention, but the chaos and multiple political crises of the revolutionary year meant that these proposals largely remained on paper, rather than being implemented in practice.This article uses prostitution and VD as lenses for tracing continuities in administrative-bureaucratic regimes, informal policing practices, and ideologies across collapsing regimes and governments in revolutionary Russia.[CITATION-7] The issues of prostitution and VD were often intertwined in official and popular discourse in this period, but this article addresses them separately\u00a0in order to examine closely two key policy shifts that had their roots in 1917\u20131918, but that continued to influence state approaches to prostitution and VD throughout the entire Soviet period: the shift away from state regulation and the criminalisation of VD transmission. In the process of remaking society out of the ashes of the old regime, new ideologies of equality, democracy and civil rights commingled with enduring ideas about the \u2018immorality\u2019 of VD and the need to police female sexuality for the benefit of public health and morality. 1917 was a year of frenetic change, but the stigmatisation of women who sold sex and paternalistic approaches to VD patients remained constant.Prostitution and VD were ever-present in Russian urban society and issues of fervent discussion among educated elites in the decades preceding 1917.[CITATION-8] However, only a handful of studies integrate these topics into the historiography of revolutionary Russia, and even then, only prostitution is mentioned in passing.[CITATION-9] This is probably because women who sold sex have long been excluded from general histories of migration and labour in pre- and post-revolutionary Russia, despite the fact that they were a group of closely monitored, and predominantly migrant, workers.[CITATION-10] The absence of prostitution and VD in scholarship on the revolution is also a question of sources. Under the regulation system, the tsarist authorities endeavoured to monitor every woman believed to be selling sex across the Russian Empire. This left behind a mass of documentation on urban prostitution and VD, which is now preserved in central and regional archives. In all the archives that I\u00a0have worked in\u00a0in the territory of the former Russian Empire, ample documentation on prostitution exists from the late nineteenth century onwards, but not for the year of 1917. The tsarist administrative organs in charge of policing prostitution disintegrated after the February Revolution, so information on prostitution and VD thereafter must be pieced together from a patchwork of sources, including military files, municipal police records and newspaper articles.The fragmented nature of material on prostitution and VD in 1917 makes it impossible to draw broad generalisations about experiences across Russia, or to access the perspectives of women engaged in prostitution or individuals who contracted venereal infections. Despite these problems with the source base, focusing on prostitution and VD in revolutionary Petrograd provides valuable perspectives on the Provisional Government\u2019s approach to public health and social issues, both themes that remain chronically understudied in the historiography of the Russian Revolution.[CITATION-11] From the material which does survive, we can explore the evolution of ideas regarding health-based citizenship and examine how various groups attempted to claim authority within the emerging societal and political order. Physicians rallied around the issues of prostitution and VD as part of their broader efforts to dominate the public health agenda of the new revolutionary state. The Provisional Government\u2019s recognition of physicians\u2019 expertise on these matters provided a corrective to decades of struggle for professional autonomy and inclusion within the state\u00a0bureaucracy.[CITATION-12] After the February Revolution, Petrograd residents, like non-elites in other regions of Russia, sought engagement with the new organs of government and law enforcement to achieve specific ends, settle old scores, and in the case of prostitution, enforce a specific moral order.[CITATION-13] Histories of prostitution do not map neatly onto political histories, as legislative changes often had little impact on policing practices at the street level.[CITATION-14] The categorisation of women engaged in commercial sex as threats to public health and social order has remained constant across the disintegration of empires and the collapse of political regimes. Many of the new nation states that emerged following the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy kept the pre-existing imperial-era legislation on prostitution.[CITATION-15] After the abolition of the state regulation of prostitution in Sweden, Weimar Germany and France, the police and state-run medical organisations continued to closely monitor and directly intervene in the lives of women suspected to be working as prostitutes.[CITATION-16] Rather than a radical rupture, the specific developments of the Russian revolutions were \u2018germinations of Russia\u2019s broader experience of modernity\u2019 and mirrored practices in radically different political contexts elsewhere on the European continent.[CITATION-17] In the case of prostitution and VD, the events of 1917\u201318 were connected to decades of national and international anti-regulation activism, to the chaos of war, and to the broader pivot towards criminal law as a method for preventing the spread of VD occurring across Europe at the turn of the twentieth century. Epidemic rates of VD raged throughout the First World War and beyond, adding another layer to the \u2018continuum of crisis\u2019 brought about by mobilisation, colossal social dislocation and the disintegration of state structures.[CITATION-18] The road to the abolition of the regulation of prostitution in Russia was long and well-trodden. Amid the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of the late nineteenth century, prostitution became increasingly visible in the urban centres of the Russian Empire, and in turn, a burning issue frequently discussed in philanthropic, political, popular and medical discourse. Charitable organisations devoted to rescuing \u2018fallen women\u2019 bemoaned the tsarist state\u2019s sanctioning of premarital and extramarital sex, while feminist groups criticised the way in which regulation institutionalised a sexual double standard and promoted gender inequality.[CITATION-19] Reform-minded doctors opposed regulation for its failure to prevent the spread of VD and for its violation of women\u2019s civil liberties, and even physicians who supported the principle of regulation branded the existing system ineffective.[CITATION-20] Opponents on the left and right of the political spectrum found common ground in linking prostitution to economic hardship and in moralising about women who sold sex.[CITATION-21] Russian upper-class feminists participated in the wave of anti-regulation activism that broke across Europe and the Americas at the turn of the twentieth century, fuelled by widespread anxiety about the abduction and procurement of white women and girls by ambiguously \u2018foreign\u2019 pimps, a practice referred to as \u2018white slavery\u2019 or the \u2018trade in women\u2019.[CITATION-22] On 8 March 1913, the\u00a0feminist physician Poliksena Shiskina-Iavein managed to arrange the introduction of a bill to the State Duma (Parliament)\u00a0calling for the abolition\u00a0of regulation, which was endorsed by all but two doctor Duma deputies.[CITATION-23] Criticism of regulation also reverberated outside the echo chamber of educated elites. Registered prostitutes wrote letters to the tsarist authorities to protest against one-sided medical examinations and their unfair treatment at the hands of the police.[CITATION-24] Urban residents demanded that state-licensed brothels be moved off their streets or shut down completely. The tsarist government largely ignored this opposition to regulation, but the growing criticism of the system mounted in the years preceding the Empire\u2019s collapse.By the time revolution broke out in February 1917, the regulation of prostitution had become an increasingly political issue, connected to the corruption of the tsarist police, the Empire\u2019s inadequate medical infrastructure, and the crippling injustices of the patriarchal gender order, sexual double standard, and limited opportunities for upward social mobility within Russia\u2019s highly stratified society. Nevertheless, regulation remained in place even after the February Revolution. Amid the upheaval, women\u2019s groups continued to push for the abolition of regulation as an important step in the pursuit of women\u2019s equality, which was not automatically enshrined in law after the collapse of the autocracy and abdication of the Tsar. On 6 March 1917, the Moscow branch of the League for Women\u2019s Equal Rights called for the \u2018abolition of any exclusionary laws applying to prostitution and the abasement of women\u2019s human dignity\u2019 as part of their demands for suffrage, equal pay and equal political representation.[CITATION-25] In their statement, the Moscow branch questioned how the new Russia could actually be considered a free country if their demands were not met, reflecting the wider frustration at the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet\u2019s reluctance to include women\u2019s rights in their respective political programmes.[CITATION-26] Later in March, the League for Women\u2019s Equal Rights organised the largest women\u2019s demonstration in Russian history and forced leaders of the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government to guarantee women\u2019s right to vote.[CITATION-27] On 4 May 1917, the Russian Society for the Protection of Women ([ROZZh]) met in Petrograd to discuss the abolition of regulation. Since its establishment in 1900, the Society had devoted its energies to combatting prostitution through providing \u2018fallen women\u2019 with moral education and material support. ROZZh organised volunteer groups at major railway stations and ports to meet newly arrived peasant migrants and prevent them from becoming acquainted with procurers and pimps.[CITATION-28] Before the February Revolution, the Society\u2019s membership roster had included members of the Imperial family and other elite dignitaries, so it was not a vocal opponent of government policy and therefore never formally campaigned for the abolition of regulation.[CITATION-29] However, the transcript of the May 1917 meeting reveals how the abolition of regulation was now regarded as an urgent necessity. Attendees unanimously agreed that regulation needed to be repealed and planned to present the Provisional Government with the same bill that the State Duma had considered in 1913 in order to apply some pressure.[CITATION-30] One month after ROZZh\u2019s meeting in June 1917, a three-day physicians\u2019 congress was held in Moscow to address the urgent issues of prostitution and one of its key consequences, VD.[CITATION-31] The congress was convened by the Pirogov Society of Russian Physicians, a national medical organisation founded in memory of medical scientist Nikolai Pirogov (1810\u201381). In the final decades of tsarism, the Pirogov Society promoted community () medicine, held regular congresses, fostered efforts for social reform, and became an active political force.[CITATION-32] The Pirogov Society had a complicated relationship with the tsarist government, as members bemoaned the constraints that official interference placed upon their professional practice, but simultaneously sought to expand their roles within the state apparatus, especially as forensic experts within the judiciary.[CITATION-33] After the February Revolution, the Society threw its support behind the Provisional Government, regarding this as its best chance to dominate the new public health agenda.[CITATION-34] The Pirogov Society had not been vocally critical of the regulation system before 1917, preferring to avoid taking a stance on certain politically contentious issues.[CITATION-35] However, at its June 1917 congress, the Society supported the abolition of regulation as an urgent necessity, arguing that prostitution could not be prevented with punitive measures, but\u00a0rather by radical social and healthcare reform.[CITATION-36] One month after the congress in July 1917, the Provisional Government established the Central Medical Sanitary Council to replace the medical institutions of the tsarist regime and to take tentative steps towards centralising healthcare in Russia.[CITATION-37] Within the Central Medical Sanitary Council, a Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases was formed, headed by venereologist Vladimir Ivanov. The Commission met on 19 July 1917 and voted to abolish the regulation system across the country by disbanding medical-police committees and closing state-licensed brothels.[CITATION-38] After more than seventy years of operation and decades of mounting opposition, the Russian regulation system was officially no\u00a0more.The Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases\u2019s vote to abolish regulation marked a rhetorical break with the pre-revolutionary past, but this decision probably had little impact in practice. The Commission was under the authority of the Central Medical Sanitary Council, which had very limited political power throughout the summer of 1917 and had to compete with both a separate military medical council and the Petrograd Soviet\u2019s medical section for influence on public health policy.[CITATION-39] Therefore, it is unclear how the (largely toothless) Commission would have had the political power or resources to change both law and practice across Russia. Additionally, the abolition of regulation had already begun during the final decades of tsarism. Due to the decentralised nature of Russian imperial governance, provincial authorities across the Empire had had significant latitude to adapt regulation in light of regional circumstances before 1917. In the early 1900s, regional authorities in Kiev (Kyiv, Ukraine), Tomsk and Iaroslavl\u2019 chose to revoke the licences of brothel madams in their cities and forced legal brothels to close.[CITATION-40] The medical examination of women registered as prostitutes in these cities continued in theory, but closing brothels would have undoubtedly made it much more difficult for the police to enforce the medical screening of registered women, which they consistently failed to do anyway. The colossal social dislocation of the First World War exacerbated existing deficiencies within the regulation system and made enforcing the medical examination and spatial segregation of registered prostitutes virtually impossible.[CITATION-41] By the time the Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases made their decision to abolish regulation in July 1917, certain city authorities had already beaten them to it. For example, in the Siberian city of Tomsk, regulation had officially ended in June 1917 by order of the City Executive Committee.[CITATION-42] After the February Revolution, medical-police committees\u2014the tsarist organisations in charge of ensuring that registered prostitutes and brothel madams followed the rules of regulation\u2014quickly ceased to exist in certain towns and cities. In the midst of the social and political upheaval, the extremely unpopular tsarist police were dissolved, disarmed, imprisoned and even murdered in Petrograd.[CITATION-43] Police stations were ransacked and huge stacks of police files were thrown into bonfires.[CITATION-44] At the ROZZh meeting in May 1917, the\u00a0venereologist F.A. Val\u2019ter explained that the Petrograd medical-police committee had been washed away by the \u2018revolutionary wave\u2019, just like other similar \u2018vestiges of the past\u2019.[CITATION-45] After this, new police forces were formed, known as militia () to signify a break with the tsarist era. In Petrograd, the tsarist police force was replaced by a variety of different militia organisations: one state-driven body under the authority of the Duma committee, and two organisations independent of central government, the workers\u2019 militia and the Petrograd city militia.[CITATION-46] The disintegration of the tsarist police and formation of new militias also took place in villages and provincial towns across the territory of the former Russian Empire.[CITATION-47] In Petrograd, the abolition of regulation did not abruptly end the centuries-old tradition of classifying women who sold sex as threats to public order, health and morality.[CITATION-48] Even though the tsarist apparatus for policing prostitution collapsed after the February Revolution, officers of the city militia continued to perform the functions of the former medical-police committee, conducting raids on suspected brothels and forcefully transporting women engaged in paid sex to hospital for VD treatment.[CITATION-49] As well as enforcing the rules of regulation, tsarist-era medical-police patrolmen had also been expected to expose \u2018clandestine prostitutes\u2019 by conducting secret surveillance on women identified as suspicious by the police or in denunciations penned by urban residents.[CITATION-50] This directive encouraged patrolmen to monitor \u2018promiscuous\u2019 women and register them as prostitutes, even when there was no concrete evidence to support their suspicions. Regional authorities pressured patrolmen to register as many \u2018clandestine prostitutes\u2019 as possible and used the number of women detained as evidence of the rigour of their local medical-police committees.[CITATION-51] On 16 May 1917, the recently\u00a0formed Petrograd city militia detained a woman for \u2018indecent behaviour\u2019 (), a phrase often synonymous with promiscuity and prostitution in official and popular discourse before 1917.[CITATION-52] In another case, two young women were detained simply \u2018for prostitution\u2019 by the Petrograd militia on 16 September 1917, almost two months after the formal abolition of regulation.[CITATION-53] As the women were found to be infected with VD, presumably following their physical examination performed by the police or a doctor, they were sent to Obukhovskaia hospital immediately for treatment. Sweeping changes to legislation did not reach the street level, as the Petrograd city militia attempted to enforce the detention and hospitalisation of women assumed to be working as prostitutes, just as the medical-police committee before them had\u00a0done.This continuity in policing practices across the February Revolution was not just confined to Petrograd; it was replicated across the territory of the former Russian Empire. In early March 1917, the Provisional Government confirmed that military commanders had the right to deport women believed to be engaged in prostitution from the theatre of conflict, a practice that began in 1915.[CITATION-54] In Tomsk, the city militia continued to detain women suspected of being engaged in prostitution and to examine them for signs of VD, even after the formal end of regulation in the city.[CITATION-55] In Riga, the medical examination of women who sold sex ceased to be police function in May 1917, but the Riga people\u2019s militia () continued to detain and examine suspected prostitutes in the months that followed.[CITATION-56] That the policing of women suspected to be engaging in prostitution persisted after the collapse of the old regime, despite the proliferation of new nodes of power and increased democratisation of state structures, is consistent with those continuities in police functions across the February Revolution which have been observed by other scholars.[CITATION-57] Indeed, the Petrograd militia performed extremely similar tasks to those of the tsarist police, including sanitary inspections, investigating complaints made by the population, and conducting searches.[CITATION-58] The February Revolution did not disrupt administrative regimes in the city of Smolensk either, as the duties and even staff composition of the city militia were remarkably similar to that of the tsarist era.[CITATION-59] In Petrograd, continuity in administrative-bureaucratic regimes was repeated in informal policing practices. A\u00a0report filed by the Petrograd city militia on 23 October 1917 revealed that a war veteran named Ivan Kalil visited the apartment of a certain Mikhail N.\u00a0at 2 a.m. and paid him 15 roubles to have sex with an unnamed woman.[CITATION-60] After he had paid, Mikhail N.\u00a0abruptly asked Kalil to leave, and severely beat him when he refused. Although the Petrograd city militia found that Mikhail N.\u00a0was clearly running a brothel at his apartment, they simply requested that Mikhail N.\u00a0return the 15 roubles to Kalil and took no further action.[CITATION-61] Before the abolition of regulation, brothel keepers had close ties to the tsarist police. A\u00a0well-established system of bribery allowed brothel keepers to pay medical-police patrolman to turn a blind eye to their violations of the rules of regulation, and in some cases, their violent or criminal behaviour.[CITATION-62] In ignoring the assault charges, the Petrograd city militia dealt with Mikhail N.\u00a0leniently, especially when compared to the treatment of women assumed to be engaged in prostitution discussed earlier. Although there is no documentary evidence confirming bribery, as a brothel keeper earning up to 15 roubles per client (an amount significantly higher than the average worker\u2019s daily wage), Mikhail N.\u00a0would have been in a financial position to pay the militia to ensure a favourable outcome.[CITATION-63] Petrograd residents used the new organs of law enforcement as an instrument to settle long-standing disputes about prostitution in urban space. Urban residents called on the Petrograd city militia to close city brothels or to conduct raids on suspected \u2018dens of debauchery\u2019. On 9 June 1917 the militia conducted a raid on the Metropol and Montenegro Hotels on Nevskii Prospekt, after which women believed to be selling sex there were sent to a nearby police station.[CITATION-64] In another case from July, the Petrograd city militia carried out a raid in the Poliustrovo district of the city after residents complained about the \u2018orgies and gambling\u2019 that happened there on a nightly basis.[CITATION-65] Raids of brothels, hotels and teahouses were conducted across the Petrogradskii district on 20 and 21 October, after which the Petrograd city militia detained a \u2018significant number\u2019 of criminals.[CITATION-66] In all these instances, the militia were assisted by groups of soldiers and the public. Elsewhere in the city, urban residents turned to other emerging organs of power in their attempts to shutter brothels. In September 1917, the Kolomenskii District Soviet vowed to forcibly close all brothels in their district after receiving a request to do so from workers at the Franco-Russian factory.[CITATION-67] Public calls for brothel closures and the participation of city residents in brothel raids marked the crescendo of decades of tension bubbling between urban residents and brothel keepers. Brothels were a contentious feature of the towns and cities of the late Russian Empire.[CITATION-68] Under the regulation system, brothels had provided valuable income for medical-police committees, as brothel keepers had been required to purchase licences, pay taxes based upon the number of women employed at their establishments, and at a more informal level, were expected to top up the low salaries of medical-police patrolmen through bribes. The financial relationship between brothel keepers and the police gave the former an elevated status within urban communities, which bred resentment. Urban residents bemoaned the fact that brothels made prostitution increasingly visible (and even audible) within the city. In the decades before the February Revolution, medical-police committees across the Russian Empire received hundreds of petitions from furious urban residents requesting that brothels be shut down or relocated.[CITATION-69] More often than not, city authorities refused these requests, prioritising the income generated from brothel keepers over the moral concerns of the petitioners. After the February Revolution, brothel keepers no longer had the protection of the tsarist police and were more vulnerable to raids and forced closures. Within this context, certain urban residents attempted to reverse traditional hierarchies, settle old scores and claim authority within the emerging moral order.[CITATION-70] The regulation of prostitution was formally abolished in 1917, but rather than a rupture, it merely marked one moment in part of a broader process. In certain cities, brothels had been shuttered and medical-police committees had ceased to operate before the abolition of regulation in July 1917. Despite the rhetorical abolition of regulation, the stigmatisation of women engaged in commercial sex stretched across the revolutionary divide, which had a significant impact on policing practices. In Petrograd and other cities, women who sold sex continued to be classified as threats to public health and morality, and their voices are entirely absent from conversations about combatting prostitution in state, philanthropic and expert discourse. The end of regulation was the outcome of decades of criticism from an increasingly noisy public sphere, the growing professionalisation of physicians, and the participation of elites in international abolitionist activism.After the collapse of the old regime, the Provisional Government inherited a public health crisis, as VD was reportedly rampant within the civilian and military populations in Petrograd and beyond. Public health experts firmly believed that rates of venereal infection had begun to rise sharply during the latter half of the nineteenth century, driven by the interconnected processes of industrialisation, mass seasonal migration and rapid urbanisation. Russian physicians and public officials, like their counterparts abroad, regarded increased VD as another manifestation of the dark side of modern life and indicative of the broader moral and physical degeneration perceived to be infecting humanity at the turn of the twentieth century.[CITATION-71] In 1897, the Ministry of Internal Affairs sponsored a congress in St Petersburg specifically to address the growing syphilis epidemic.[CITATION-72] Throughout the early 1900s, countless articles penned by physicians expressed concern that rates of syphilis and gonorrhoea were constantly increasing in urban and rural settings.[CITATION-73] In 1911, thereported that syphilis was the third most commonly registered disease across the Russian Empire, beaten only by influenza and malaria.[CITATION-74] Another survey from 1914 stated that 10 per cent of all city residents in Revel\u2019 had VD, as well as 6 per cent of St Petersburg inhabitants and almost 5 per cent of all Muscovites.[CITATION-75] The situation was even worse for military personnel, who experienced significantly higher levels of venereal infection in the late imperial period.[CITATION-76] In 1904, military statistics reported that nearly half of all soldiers had syphilis.[CITATION-77] In certain ports and garrisons, the percentage of infected military personnel was far higher.[CITATION-78] In his recent book, Tsuyoshi Hasegawa claims the \u2018VD epidemic\u2019 of 1917 was caused by the end of the regulation of prostitution, as women who sold sex were no longer subject to medical examinations to prevent the spread of infection.[CITATION-79] However, all the available evidence suggests that VD was already widespread in the decades preceding the revolution. Syphilis and gonorrhoea were extremely common among registered prostitutes who were working under regulation and (in theory) subject to regular examinations. The decentralisation of regulation meant that the tsarist government relied on individual municipal authorities to raise the money to pay for the doctors, rooms and instruments required for registered prostitutes\u2019 examinations.[CITATION-80] Municipal governments were subject to various fiscal constraints and often struggled to raise the necessary funds to provide the most basic services for the expanding urban population.[CITATION-81] Because of this, registered prostitutes\u2019 examinations were often conducted in squalid conditions, rushed, and largely futile. Specialist doctors were hired for these examinations, but they were often required to see hundreds of women per hour, which meant that signs of infection were frequently missed.[CITATION-82] Municipal governments also struggled to provide free treatment for registered women who contracted venereal diseases.[CITATION-83] In 1909, almost 40 per cent of all registered prostitutes in European Russia had a venereal infection and almost half of the women registered on the St Petersburg police lists had syphilis.[CITATION-84] The outbreak of war in 1914 further exacerbated the situation. Millions of soldiers contracted diseases during their service and millions more were wounded, which placed enormous strain on the Empire\u2019s already inadequate medical facilities.[CITATION-85] Disease ravaged the civilian population amid immense social dislocation, as millions of Russian subjects were displaced from their homes on the front line to the interior provinces of the Empire.[CITATION-86] Rates of VD soared as medical practitioners were drafted into the war effort and fewer hospital beds were available to venereal patients.[CITATION-87] To make matters worse, the military leadership pursued policies that actively contributed to the widespread circulation of VD. On 16 January 1915, the Supreme Chief of the Medical Directorate of the Military issued Order No. 28, a directive that forbade the admission of soldiers and sailors infected with VD to hospitals unless their disease was in its most severe form.[CITATION-88] Not only did this mean that hundreds of thousands of men with highly infectious VD were evicted from hospitals or simply left untreated, but it also prevented the collection of accurate statistics during the war years.[CITATION-89] After the collapse of the old regime, physicians and military commanders turned their attention to eradicating the VD epidemic. The Pirogov Society held an emergency conference in April 1917 to discuss the healthcare crisis facing the Empire due to the inadequate state of medical services and the extraordinary conditions of wartime.[CITATION-90] After hearing the remarks of various delegates, the Society decided to organise a separate emergency conference specifically to discuss soaring rates of venereal infection a few months later. The All-Russian Pirogov Conference of Physicians for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases met in Moscow on 10\u201312 June 1917 and issued a public statement on how to combat widespread VD shortly afterwards. They insisted on the urgent need for treatment to be organised at hospitals, sanatoria and outpatient facilities, stressed the importance of mass health education, and called on co-operative societies to help fund the cost of medications.[CITATION-91] The call for an urgent response to the VD epidemic was mirrored in the military. At end of May 1917, the Chief Military Medical Inspector wrote to the War Minister outlining the severity of epidemic VD, as he stressed that syphilis had become a grave threat to the health of troops at the front and rear and that stopping the spread of infection was now \u2018a matter of national importance\u2019.[CITATION-92] In late June and early July 1917, the Central Medical Sanitary Council outlined a series of new measures to address VD in the military.[CITATION-93] The blanket ban on the hospitalisation of military venereal patients from 1915 was lifted, and recommendations included preventive measures that reform-minded military physicians had been pushing for decades: widespread popular health education, freely available contraceptives, and universal free treatment for military personnel and civilians.The solutions proposed by the Pirogov Society and the Central Medical Sanitary Soviet provided a corrective to decades of struggle between medical professionals and the tsarist authorities in the realm of VD control. State attempts to prevent the circulation of venereal infection in the tsarist era had been mainly conducted with the involvement of the police and were primarily reactive, involving the examination and forced hospitalisation of specific lower-class populations who were thought to be the primary transmitters of infection, namely women engaged in prostitution, migrant workers and military personnel.[CITATION-94] Various public health practitioners, especiallyphysicians and urban doctors who predominantly served lower-class communities, were extremely critical of forced examinations and hospitalisation, complaining that these practices violated individual liberty and civic rights, served to stigmatise the patient and acted as a disincentive to seeking treatment voluntarily.[CITATION-95] Throughout the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, medical professionals sought greater autonomy in matters related to disease control and an end to the involvement of the police.[CITATION-96] This was part of broader opposition to the constraints placed upon their professional practice by restrictive criminal laws, as well as the quest for official recognition of physicians\u2019 expertise in matters of public health.[CITATION-97] Rather than forced hospitalisation, physicians advocated affordable and available treatment alongside treating the perceived principal causes of widespread VD: poverty, poor housing, insufficient food, hygienic ignorance and the prevalence of unhygienic traditional practices in the countryside, such as communal eating and sleeping.[CITATION-98] Just likemedicine, treatment and health education were ideally to be organised at a local level by provincial organisations specifically dedicating to combatting VD\u00a0and staffed exclusively by specialist physicians with knowledge of the specific characteristics of the region in question.[CITATION-99] Collecting accurate statistics on VD across the Empire was also deemed an urgent necessity.[CITATION-100] The recommendations made by the Pirogov Society and the Central Medical Sanitary Soviet in 1917 appear to have been hypothetical proposals for the future, when the chaos of war had abated and when more state funding was available for medical facilities. The Central Medical Sanitary Soviet insisted that venereal patients were to be treated in field hospitals \u2018equipped with all the necessary medicines and instruments necessary for treatment\u2019 including laboratories for conducting the Wasserman reaction, a highly specialised blood test for the detection of syphilis.[CITATION-101] Special outpatient clinics for less severe cases were also to be established at the front and staffed by dedicated venereological specialists. Only military personnel suffering from the most severe infections were to be evacuated to the rear, where they ought to be admitted to separate military hospitals to prevent them from spreading their infection within the civilian population. These measures would have been impossible to implement in practice: hospitals were severely overcrowded in wartime and there were chronic shortages in medical personnel and supplies. Between 1915 and 1916, 24,623 venereal patients were refused admission at one hospital in Kiev, and one doctor was responsible for 1,500 venereal patients at Moscow general hospital throughout the war.[CITATION-102] Furthermore, after the February Revolution, the army continued to mobilise thousands of physicians, leaving a lack of qualified specialists at the home front throughout 1917.[CITATION-103] Doctors strove to end the coercive practices of the incompetent tsarist government, but they did not envisage a complete end to coercion in the treatment of venereal patients. While criticising government methods, Russian physicians in the late imperial period advocated forcontrol over patients, so long as agency was transferred from unqualified bureaucrats to \u2018\u201cknowledgeable\u201d liberal professionals working for the public good\u2019.[CITATION-104] This continued after the February Revolution, driven by the persistence of paternalistic notions within the medical community about Russia\u2019s vast lower-class population, who were presumed to be na\u00efve, ignorant and in need of direction from those in positions of social, cultural and educational superiority.[CITATION-105] Paternalism was especially potent in approaches to VD, as public health practitioners largely believed that such infections were spread either through lack of self-restraint or because of the low cultural and educational level of the patient. In the countryside, venereal patients were presumed to have contracted their infections through the communal customs of rural life, such as sharing spoons, beds and bowls with infected people. Delegates at the 1897 Syphilis Congress agreed that over three quarters of syphilis patients were such \u2018victims of ignorance and low levels of culture\u2019.[CITATION-106] In contrast, the same diseases were presumed to be spread through sexual contact in urban centres, as lower-class urban dwellers fell victim to the debauched nature of modern city life. This stubborn refusal to regard syphilis and gonorrhoea as sexually transmitted diseases in rural space was part of the educated elite\u2019s idealised perceptions of the Empire\u2019s peasant population as na\u00efve, innocent and in need of paternal protection.[CITATION-107] Laura Engelstein suggests that these epidemiological understandings began to shift in the decade before the 1917 revolutions, as increased peasant mobility and the widespread engagement in the strikes, mutinies and rural unrest of the 1905 revolution shook physicians\u2019 image of the na\u00efve and innocent rural venereal patient.[CITATION-108] However, these ideas were certainly still alive after February 1917. At a meeting of the Central Medical Soviet\u2019s Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases in the summer of 1917, the\u00a0prominent venereologist and dermatologist Oskar Petersen claimed that 97 per cent of syphilis infections were sexually transmitted in urban centres, whereas in the countryside the disease was a \u2018people\u2019s disaster\u2019 () as 85 per cent of cases were spread without any sexual contact.[CITATION-109] His recommendations for controlling syphilis emphasised the centrality of medical experts and the state, who ought to work together to provide universally available (and affordable) treatment. Patients were described exclusively in passive terms, as individuals to be sent to hospital for specific treatments, to be \u2018thoroughly disinfected\u2019 during the contagious stages of their infection or, in the case of soldiers at the front, prevented from returning home if found to be exhibiting symptoms of infection.[CITATION-110] Petersen\u2019s recommendations echoed commonly held views within the medical profession, which largely presumed that lower-class patients were ignorant about the transmission and treatment of VD. This presumption did not necessarily correspond to reality, especially not in the early 1900s when advertisements for medical services, medicines and advice literature filled the pages of mass-circulation newspapers.[CITATION-111] At the same time, rising consumerism and the development of Russia\u2019s internal and international postal system also afforded Russians greater opportunities to place postal orders.[CITATION-112] Within this environment, advertisements for VD cures, as well as rudimentary contraceptive devices, impotence cures and books on a whole host of sexual themes, appeared with increasing frequency.[CITATION-113] There is also evidence to suggest that venereal patients had an awareness of the different treatments available to them and their efficacy in the early 1900s. After the development of the first effective cure for syphilis (arsphenamine, more commonly known as Salvarsan 606 or the \u2018magic bullet\u2019) at the laboratory of the\u00a0German immunologist Paul Ehrlich in 1909, patients in naval hospitals began to demand the treatment as it was both more effective and less painful than the alternative of mercury therapy.[CITATION-114] In June 1911, a riot broke out at the Odessa city hospital when syphilitic patients demanded to be treated with Salvarsan and refused to take any other medications prescribed by doctors.[CITATION-115] Therefore, physicians\u2019 presumptions of ignorance reflected their own assumptions about the na\u00efvety of their lower-class patients and their need for paternalistic protection and guidance.In certain professional circles, the persistence of paternalism in discussions of VD control led to discussions of forced treatment. In September 1917, public health experts gathered in Tomsk to address the various health crises currently facing inhabitants of the region. In their discussions of VD, delegates generally agreed that poverty was a factor contributing to rising rates of infection and remarked on the urgent need for free treatment and health education. Taking the floor, the\u00a0professor of law and historian of medicine Nikolai Novombergskii insisted on the need for compulsory treatment for individuals who were infected with VD:The principle of coercion was discredited under the police system, when it was applied to the majority for the interests of the minority. In a socialist democracy, the principle of coercion will be applied to the minority in the interests of the majority. If it is considered necessary to destroy rotten herring or meat, vaccinate for smallpox, quarantine for the plague, or destroy unhealthy housing, then compulsory treatment for syphilis patients should be imposed \u2026 The idea has developed that coercion in healthcare is incompatible with the demands of public and political freedom. It is time to end this delusion.[CITATION-116] As\u00a0can\u00a0be seen in the above quotation, even though Novombergskii was calling for a continuation of tsarist-era practices, he couched his recommendations in the political language of the era. Other delegates sympathised with his position and insisted that coercive () measures were necessary to combat the \u2018syphilisation\u2019 () of the population.[CITATION-117] The discussions among public health experts in Tomsk echo the broader paternalistic visions of educated elites that stretched across the revolutionary divide. Aaron Retish\u2019s work on Viatka explores how Provisional Government administrators\u2019 perceptions of the peasantry as poorly educated, ignorant and uncultured informed their views on peasant citizenship. Provisional Government elites in this region regarded themselves as \u2018full participants and citizens\u2019 in the broader project to build a democratic Russia, but did not include peasants, and especially non-Russian peasants, as equal partners in this vision.[CITATION-118] Despite the discourses about citizenship and equality\u00a0in circulation, demeaning perceptions of lower-class people held by certain educated elites were \u2018incongruous with democratic ideals of citizenship\u2019 in which all citizens were equal members of the political community.[CITATION-119] Discussions of VD control in summer 1917 revealed new understandings of civic belonging that were founded on social hygienic principles. Good sexual health became an important component of citizenship in the new Russian republic, and the individual had a responsibility to put aside personal desires and bodily autonomy for the benefit of the social body. Experts stressed the importance of Russians becoming \u2018hygienic citizens\u2019, individuals who willingly complied with restrictions on their rights and freedom in the name of preserving and perpetuating the future of the nation.[CITATION-120] A\u00a0handful of doctors at the Tomsk conference agreed that abstinence ought to be mandatory for men and women before marriage and that it was the duty of physicians to dispel any myths about sexual continence being harmful to health.[CITATION-121] In June 1917, the Union of Maritime Physicians in Petrograd called for mandatory periodic examinations of sailors\u2019 genitalia.[CITATION-122] They snubbed the idea of abstinence for military personnel as an unrealistic goal, and instead instructed military doctors to keep accurate lists of sailors who asked for prophylactic devices and medicines, effectively monitoring their sexual activity. One month later, in July, the branch of the Pirogov Society dedicated to VD issued a call for society-wide mobilisation to prevent the \u2018physical and spiritual degeneration\u2019 of the Russian nation that was allegedly brought about by widespread venereal infection. Addressing all Russian citizens, the Society insisted that donating money to the cause of fighting venereal diseases was the responsibility of the public because the government was facing \u2018difficult days\u2019 and could not provide any funding.[CITATION-123] This call for citizens to \u2018compensate for the state disintegration occurring around them\u2019 echoed discussions among tax inspectors in summer 1917 about citizens\u2019 responsibility to pay their taxes and effectively manage their own personal financial budgets.[CITATION-124] Not only did \u2018hygienic citizens\u2019 have a societal responsibility to comply with treatment and inspection regimes, they also had to part with their money to ensure the health of the wider population.Discourse on the health responsibilities of citizenship became especially significant as Petrograd plunged into crisis in\u00a0the summer\u00a0of 1917. Amid a backdrop of deteriorating living conditions, food and fuel shortages, and a devastatingly unpopular military offensive at the front, the Provisional Government faced a series of progressive disasters. The so-called \u2018summer of discontent\u2019 was punctuated by violent clashes between armed demonstrators and government troops in July and an unsuccessful putsch against the Petrograd Soviet organised by General Lavr Kornilov in August.[CITATION-125] Political crisis was accompanied by economic collapse, soaring unemployment and rapid social disintegration.[CITATION-126] Chronic shortages in food, fuel and other essential supplies reached catastrophic proportions, which were further compounded by major problems with supply and transportation.[CITATION-127] At the end of July 1917, the Provisional Government abolished Petrograd\u2019s temporary courts, which deprived city residents of a \u2018state-approved method to satisfy their sense of justice\u2019.[CITATION-128] Thousands of convicts escaped from poorly\u00a0guarded prisons in the city and the incidence of mob justice\u00a0and organised and petty crime dramatically shot up, creating a potent atmosphere of social anarchy, chaos and lawlessness across the capital.[CITATION-129] In this context, critiques of lower-class city dwellers\u2019 use of their new freedoms to advance their own narrow personal interests emerged in the centre and right-wing press, and liberals and moderate socialists urged workers and soldiers to show restraint and responsibility for the \u2018common good\u2019.[CITATION-130] In response, workers and soldiers refuted these claims in public appeals and asserted their willingness to sacrifice their personal interests for the revolution. In doing so, they criticised those who misinterpreted freedom in hedonistic terms, ignoring the \u2018order, responsibility, sense of duty, and moral self-discipline\u2019 that came with \u2018real\u2019 freedom.[CITATION-131] They drew on well-established pre-revolutionary discourses critiquing the growing individualism, moral decay and excess that allegedly permeated life in Russia\u2019s rapidly expanding urban centres around the turn of the twentieth century.[CITATION-132] Stemming the social anarchy of\u00a0the summer\u00a0of 1917 was categorised as the responsibility of individuals, who ought to show restraint and self-discipline in order to ensure the future of the nation. Therefore, maintaining good sexual health was imbued with urgent significance, especially because medical professionals understood VD as illnesses spread through engagement in extramarital and premarital sex in urban centres. Avoiding contracting VD by exercising sexual restraint was necessary for hygienic citizens of the new\u00a0Russia.The Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolshevik party in October 1917 before any discussions about how the state ought to approach the interconnected issues of prostitution and VD were\u00a0translated into co-ordinated state policy. By the\u00a0summer of\u00a01917, many prominent physicians working within the Central Medical Sanitary Soviet had grown frustrated with the slow pace of reform and began to call for more radical solutions, including the disbandment of the Provisional Government and a sharp pivot towards \u2018social democratic\u2019 medicine.[CITATION-133] The limited fiscal and administrative resources available to the Provisional Government meant that the VD epidemic continued to rage throughout 1917 and beyond. In January 1918, the Chief of the Sanitary Division of the Northern Front wrote to the Petrograd Soviet expressing concern about the continued rise in the incidence of syphilis and gonorrhoea. The potent combination of the long-term impact of tsarist-era policy, the absence of doctors at the rear, poor discipline in the army, the breakdown of railway transportation and the chronic lack of funding for the co-ordination of medical treatment meant that VD had reached \u2018terrifying\u2019 levels and now \u2018the degeneration of future generations\u2019 was apparently a very real possibility.[CITATION-134] After the Bolsheviks\u2019 seizure of power and an initial period of hesitation, most of the physicians in the Central Medical Sanitary Soviet joined efforts to construct a system of social medicine.[CITATION-135] Continuities in personnel meant that rather than a radical rupture, approaches to VD after the October revolution built upon long-standing assumptions about venereal patients as well as broader conceptions of health-based citizenship that were in circulation among medical experts in spring and summer\u00a01917.VD treatment became more available and accessible for Petrograd residents after the Bolsheviks\u2019 seizure of power. In 1918, the Bolsheviks took steps towards establishing a state-led campaign to combat VD. Rather than swift centralisation and the rapid nationalisation of the healthcare economy, this process was gradual, very much driven by local actors, and largely dependent on the co-operation of staff at Petrograd\u2019s clinics and hospitals.[CITATION-136] The existing Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases that had been founded after the February revolution was absorbed into the administrative structures of the Commissariat for Health. Thereafter, a Central Commission for the Struggle with Venereal Diseases was set up in Moscow (the new Russian capital after March 1918)\u00a0and subsidiary organisations were established in other towns and cities.[CITATION-137] The Petrograd iteration was the Venereological Soviet, headed by Evgenii Pervukhin\u00a0of the Commissariat for Health for the Northern Commune.[CITATION-138] The Venereological Soviet first met at the end of April 1918 at its headquarters in the Women\u2019s Medical Institute.[CITATION-139] They immediately began collecting accurate statistics on rates of venereal infection, conducting a thorough audit of clinics and treatment facilities in the city, and sourcing demonstration materials for a public lecture series, including dummies and models that had been stored in the basement of Anichkov Palace for safekeeping during the revolution.[CITATION-140] Over the course of 1918, various city hospitals were ordered to offer free open-admission outpatient treatment for a couple of hours each day or evening and previously defunct clinics were renovated and re-opened.[CITATION-141] That being said, efforts to make treatment more available were not without their teething problems. In June 1918, a certain Dr Belkin wrote to Pervukhin regarding issues with his newly opened outpatient clinic on Bol\u2019shoi Prospekt in the Petrogradskii district. Although Belkin had bought all the necessary medical supplies and hired staff, he was unable to offer treatment to city residents because the Belgian Electric Society refused to release the necessary electric current to the clinic.[CITATION-142] Despite healthcare reform, state approaches to prostitution in Petrograd were marked by glaring continuities both in ideology and practice. On 5 October 1918, the regional Soviet for the city\u2019s Petrogradskii district reinstituted compulsory medical examinations for women engaged in prostitution, with non-attendance carrying an extremely steep fine, forced labour or even deportation from the city.[CITATION-143] Six days later the Executive Committee for the Northern Commune cancelled the order and instructed the Venereological Soviet to establish a special commission specifically on the issue of prostitution.[CITATION-144] The commission, known as the Petrograd Commission for the Struggle with Prostitution, largely repeated Marxist interpretations of prostitution as a product of women\u2019s economic and political inequality and advocated state-led solutions, such as providing women with work, housing and education.[CITATION-145] Despite this, other comments made during the meeting presented prostitution as the consequence of women\u2019s exposure to the \u2018vice\u2019 and temptation of modern Petrograd. Gorin, the representative from the Commissariat for Justice, recommended censoring \u2018seductive\u2019 films at the cinema, as they apparently caused sexual arousal and, by extension, drew women into paid sex.[CITATION-146] The representative from the Commissariat for Social Welfare called for the organisation of special groups at train stations to meet young female migrants and help them find \u2018honest work\u2019, an approach already trialled by the elite philanthropic organisation ROZZh in the early 1900s.[CITATION-147] This mix of economic, social and moral explanations set the precedent for state approaches to prostitution in the following decade. Throughout the 1920s, Soviet state officials continued to cling to pre-revolutionary stereotypes about the \u2018type\u2019 of women who engaged in prostitution, despite officially subscribing to Marxist interpretations of prostitutes as blameless victims of capitalism. The stigmatisation of women engaged in paid sex endured for the remainder of the Soviet period, and often disrupted any meaningful attempts to address women\u2019s economic and social inequality.[CITATION-148] Discussions about the eradication of prostitution occurring in Petrograd in November 1918 also reflected the broader movement towards criminal law as a method for preventing the spread of venereal diseases that occurred both within Russia and across Europe in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In that month, members of the Petrograd Commission for the Struggle with Prostitution called for the introduction of a new criminal statute to prosecute individuals who infected others with VD (through sexual contact or otherwise), as well as individuals who failed to disclose a venereal infection to a sexual partner or a close contact.[CITATION-149] The Russian Empire\u2019s criminal code had featured a series of laws criminalising individuals who deliberately transmitted infectious diseases, as well as physicians and police officers who failed to report cases of infectious diseases to the appropriate authorities.[CITATION-150] However, an article criminalising the deliberate transmission of venereal infections alone appeared in the first Soviet criminal code of\u00a01922, and this particular article remained in place until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.[CITATION-151] Here, Soviet Russia was part of a bigger international trend, as the regulation of prostitution was replaced by legislation penalising individuals for spreading venereal infections in various European countries in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[CITATION-152] The introduction of pronatalist and disease-control initiatives across the continent in the aftermath of the First World War was in part driven by concern about falling birthrates, which had a negative impact on a nation\u2019s ability to build the large armies required for modern warfare. In the Soviet context as elsewhere, the anti-VD law that was proposed in 1918 and introduced in 1922 was used as a method for thecriminalisation of women engaged in paid sex, who continued to be regarded as a threat to social order and public health long after the revolutions of 1917.The February Revolution of 1917 offered new possibilities for the re-organisation of society and the destruction of the vestiges of the tsarist past, but the chaos and multiple political crises of the revolutionary year placed limits upon how much could be achieved in practice. One such pre-revolutionary vestige was the regulation of prostitution, which had strong associations with the corruption of the tsarist police, the social and gendered inequalities of late imperial society, and the imperial government\u2019s unwillingness adequately to ensure the health of its subjects. The abolition of regulation in the\u00a0summer\u00a0of 1917 marked a radical break with the pre-revolutionary past. Abolishing regulation was an attempt by physicians to exert influence on public health policy within the emerging regime and a political project that was interconnected with broader discourses of liberation and efforts to rid society of the unwanted remnants of the old regime. However, in Petrograd, the revolution did not disrupt well-established class or gender stereotypes, and this had profound implications for the way in which medical professionals and the police approached the issues of prostitution and\u00a0VD.Throughout 1917, discussions of VD also drew on well-peddled stereotypes about the ignorance of lower-class patients and their need for the paternalistic guidance of medical experts, although these discussions were now couched in terms of the dominant discourses of citizenship and democracy. In the wake of an ongoing VD epidemic, ideas of civic belonging commingled with social hygienic principles and good sexual health became an important component of citizenship in the new Russian republic. The idea that individuals had a responsibility to sacrifice their individual sexual desires for the benefit of wider public health was in circulation in the\u00a0summer of\u00a01917, and this would later become a cornerstone of state approaches to VD in the Soviet Union. The shift toward the criminalisation of VD transmission was an extension of ideas that had developed before the Bolsheviks\u2019 seizure of power and the formation of the Soviet\u00a0Union.",
