    "article": "A central concern of historical writing on the modern British Conservative Party has been that of adaptation and survival: to what extent, and in what ways, did the party appeal to new voters, in new areas, and on new terms? This article demonstrates, through an analysis of Conservative and Unionist intellectual culture, that the late Victorian and Edwardian period was a vital moment in which men and women, historians, novelists, journalists, MPs and peers were constructively re-envisaging what it meant to be a Conservative, or a Unionist, in the wake of the Third Reform Acts (1884\u20135) and the first Irish Home Rule Bill (1886). It argues that Conservative and Unionist intellectual culture evidences the constructive and imaginative ways in which the protection and \u2018maintenance\u2019 of the constitution was conceived both through the recognition and adoption of new modes of political legitimation and argument\u2014including the referendum, Lords reform and women\u2019s representation\u2014and the construction of novel histories and genealogies. This was, therefore, a vital moment in the development of a modern \u2018C/conservative\u2019 tradition, as Conservatives and Unionists put pen to paper in order to express their C/conservative principles, as well as to inform and educate.Waves of socialism and anarchy are sweeping over the world and are ready to break upon our shores and destroy all our precious institutions\u2026Jennie, Lady Randolph Churchill[CITATION-1] The notion that Conservatives such as Jennie, Lady Randolph Churchill, speaking here to a Surrey division of the Primrose League in 1886, revered national institutions may not seem particularly surprising. Churchill was expressing her reverence for a very particular national institution: the British, or English, constitution\u2014which had held a central place in the national historical imagination for a great deal of the recent past. It provided Britain with its own, and was the basis for ideas of national exceptionalism and of the liberties of the freeborn Englishman (and sometimes woman). The exaltation of the constitution was a mainstay of British political discourse in the nineteenth century: the slow growth and development of the constitution\u2014consisting of the Crown, Lords and Commons, plus the Anglican Church\u2014from Magna Carta to the Glorious Revolution and the Whig settlement of 1688\u20139 was seen as the foundation of the liberty and relative stability found in Victorian Britain, in contrast to its continental and transatlantic rivals.[CITATION-2] It shaped national identity, provided the lifeblood of party politics, and permeated culture at all levels through its depiction in histories, songs, and visual media.[CITATION-3] Such beliefs were shared across the political spectrum, yet it was the Conservatives who held the motto of \u2018Constitution in Church and State\u2019 as their defining principle. As Samuel Johnson had written in his(1755), a Tory was \u2018one who adheres to the ancient constitution in the State, and an apostolic hierarchy of the church of England\u2019.[CITATION-4] This constitutional principle had the flexibility to unite Sir Robert Peel with his famous critic, Benjamin Disraeli, and also to unite Disraeli withfamous critic, Lord Salisbury. It was, therefore, a principle that offered space for intra- as well as inter-party understandings, which naturally changed over time as contexts and priorities shifted. The late Victorian and Edwardian period, however, is typically characterised by a shift away from the constitutional agenda towards new principles and new problems, and the disaggregation and flux that soon followed. In order to understand Conservative electoral hegemony, historical scholarship has consistently pointed to a palpable move towards the politics of the economy, of social reform, and of the better organisation and management of the empire, as well as to the significance of gender, class, locality and associational culture as important facets of Conservative politics.[CITATION-5] At the same time, it is clear that the alliance of Conservatives and Liberal Unionists (who broke from the Gladstonian Liberals over Irish Home Rule), from the late 1880s until their formal fusion into the Conservative and Unionist Party in 1912, remained united by a core constitutional principle: the maintenance of the 1801 Act of Union with Ireland and, therefore, the preservation of unitary parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster.[CITATION-6] But how exactly did this principle fit into the complex world of Conservative and Unionist political and intellectual culture described above? What did constitutional maintenance entail, and what did it actuallyto be a Conservative (later Unionist) with constitutional principles in the wake of the Third Reform Acts (1884\u20135) and Gladstone\u2019s conversion to the cause of Irish Home Rule in December 1885? The former had finally brought mass democratic politics to Britain, while the latter led to a fundamental rupture in nineteenth-century two-party politics as it had hitherto been understood: to contemporaries, this was a moment of seismic political change. Indeed, the distinctiveness and longevity of Liberal Unionism is now the subject of an increasing body of scholarship.[CITATION-7] In order to address these questions, I will examine Conservative and Unionist attempts at constitutional maintenance through a study of texts published between 1885 and 1914. The period certainly saw the beginning of an important transformation in the priorities and language of political and national identities in Britain, but this was a more difficult move for Conservative and Liberal Unionists, who had held firm (and sometimes opposing) principles about the need to maintain and protect the British constitution. I will argue that significant intellectual efforts were made by Unionists from across the spectrum to construct and consider moderate proposals for constitutional reform which sought to maintain what they saw as the essential character\u2014or central \u2018organs\u2019\u2014of the constitution. This was a substantial contribution to political thinking, which not only reframed but expanded familiar ideas of \u2018reforming proven abuses\u2019 and of the need to \u2018reform to conserve\u2019 now associated with figures such as Peel, Edmund Burke and Thomas Babington Macaulay.[CITATION-8] In doing so, I offer a complement and a corrective to the existing literature on late Victorian and Edwardian Unionist politics and culture. Ewen Green\u2019s classic work,, focused on the debates over tariff reform and imperial preference, and offered a clear statement of the ways in which party politics intersected with intellectual culture, and therefore the broader history of ideas.[CITATION-9] Since its publication, however, historians have tended to focus on the disparate political cultures of Conservatism, rather than on material which sought to produce unifying principles. The articulation of more abstract ideas does not stand outside social realities, however, and they form a distinctive and fundamental layer in the development of broad Conservative beliefs. Some of the limitations to the understandings of such ideas that have been formulated thus far are conceptual. Green, for instance, distinguished between two traditions in Conservative thought: the \u2018pessimistic quietism\u2019 of inaction associated, for him, with Salisbury, and the \u2018Conservative statism\u2019 that favoured social reform and communal duties.[CITATION-10] This was then fitted into a broader debate about individualism versus collectivism: divisions were between a progressive Conservatism centred on social reform and a more positive attitude towards state intervention, and a stationary conservative (in the most basic sense) or individualist approach.[CITATION-11] However, recognising that for the majority of Conservative and Unionist writers, journalists and historians, as well as a number of politicians, the maintenance of the constitution remained a core principle takes us beyond these binary categories. There was, as always, a divergence on means and ends, and it was this that produced, if not a definite single policy or party view for the Conservative or Unionist Party elite, then a rich intellectual culture of debate and literary production that was novel at least for the Conservative portion of the Unionist alliance. Both Conservatives and Liberal Unionists were acutely aware of the need both to respond intellectually to their Liberal and Labour rivals and to accommodate one another.In fact, there is a growing interest among historians in Unionist constitutionalism in this period. David Thackeray has outlined how Unionist activists in the immediate pre-war years were developing a much broader catalogue of issues intended to appeal to voters of all classes\u2014from the defenders of loyal Ulstermen and the established Church, to supporters of social justice and rural landholdings.[CITATION-12] Beyond Home Rule, notable work by Geraint Thomas, David Dutton, Kevin Manton, Corinne Comstock Weston, David Close, and D.G. Boyce and J.O. Stubbs has detailed the ways in which the House of Lords, demands for women\u2019s suffrage, the idea of the referendum, federalism and empire fired the Conservative and Unionist imagination.[CITATION-13] Most recently, Colin Read has argued for the need to consider the ways in which Irish Unionist political thought from 1912 onwards sought to claim ownership of newly authoritative conceptions of democracy and sovereignty, notably \u2018the will of the people\u2019.[CITATION-14] So we need to answer the question not only of what importance the constitution had for definitions of Conservatism and/or Unionism, but also of what kinds of arguments were being made to reform or to resist constitutional developments. This article draws these concerns and debates together through an examination of three principal issues: women\u2019s suffrage, House of Lords reform, and the referendum. The aim is to demonstrate that, between 1885 and 1914, the constitution remained of considerable importance to both Conservatism and Unionism as political and intellectual traditions. Efforts to maintain and reform the constitution produced fervent and imaginative responses, from the Primrose League speeches of Jennie Churchill through to the more scholarly texts of Conservative historians and writers, and provided the basis for defining what it meant to be a Conservative or Unionist in this period.In order to grasp the full importance of \u2018constructive constitutionalism\u2019, however, we have to look beyond parliamentary and high political discourse to a wider corpus of literature in which\u2014largely for the first time\u2014Conservative principles were being popularised. The texts themselves took the form of books (including published speeches, lectures and articles), periodical articles and pamphlets. It is important to appreciate the sheer number of texts which very explicitly sought to construct histories, genealogies and political philosophies for Conservatives and Unionists as well as general audiences. For politicians such as Lord Hugh Cecil (1869\u20131956), F.E. Smith (1872\u20131930), Leo Amery (1873\u20131955), Godfrey Locker-Lampson (1875\u20131946) and Noel Skelton (1880\u20131935); historians such as J.A.R. Marriott (1859\u20131945), William Sharp McKechnie (1863\u20131930), Keith Feiling (1884\u20131977) and Geoffrey Butler (1887\u20131929); journalists and writers such as W.H. Mallock (1849\u20131923), Arthur Boutwood (1864\u20131924), Arthur Baumann (1856\u20131936), Sidney Low (1857\u20131962), G.S. Street (1867\u20131936), Harry Roberts (1871\u20131946), Sir Arthur Page (1876\u20131958), and the novelist-cum-Governor General of Canada, John Buchan (1875\u20131940), their early and pre-war writings show a novel and clear interest in the construction and expression of Conservative or Unionist principles. This is also true, as we will see, of Conservative and Unionist women such as Jennie Churchill (1854\u20131921), Theresa (Talbot), Lady Londonderry (1856\u20131919), Mary Maxse (1870\u20131944) and Mary (Mrs Humphry) Ward (1851\u20131920): it is time to put women\u2019s speeches and writings back into the history of Conservative and Unionist political thought.The importance of periodical writing will come as no surprise to historians of nineteenth-century political and intellectual culture.[CITATION-15] Periodical writing was a central forum for the articulation and circulation of political thought in nineteenth-century Britain\u2014Conservative as well as Radical or Liberal.[CITATION-16] During the late Victorian and Edwardian period more specifically, older Conservative periodicals such asand thesurvived, but faced increasing competition from newer publications such as the(1883), which boasted close connections to Conservative Central Office and attracted big-name writers: its circulation rose from 5,000 in its founding decade to 10,000 in the Edwardian period.[CITATION-17] Meanwhile, thenot only became more recognisably Conservative after 1900, but increased its circulation from 14,000 in the 1860s to 20,000 in the inter-war period.[CITATION-18] Conservative and Unionist writers also published in more general\u2014and sometimes \u2018Liberal\u2019\u2014publications such asand the. On one hand, the periodical press suffered from the growth of the mass media from the 1880s: though circulation figures rose for a number of periodicals, the diversification of print culture meant more competition for the established quarterlies and monthlies. On the other hand, developments in printing technology made it much easier to print books, and at a much lower price. The market for book-buying expanded as more and more people had the literacy levels, leisure time and disposable income to buy and read published material.[CITATION-19] This led to the production of political texts which aimed to inspire and invigorate; to educate. Texts such as, featuring essays on the constitution by A.V. Dicey, F.E. Smith, and Lords Lansdowne, Willoughby de Broke, Hugh Cecil and Selborne, as well as Cecil\u2019s\u2014both published in 1912\u2014were specifically aimed at beginners who knew little about the political world but wanted to learn more.[CITATION-20] The first section of this article examines the response to women\u2019s suffrage which took the specific form of schemes for women\u2019s chambers in parliament. The second covers the response to calls to reform the House of Lords. The third explores the Unionist interest in the referendum. I will finish by addressing their more negative counterpart: the pessimistic, rhetorically violent, anti-revolutionary arguments put forward as the constitutional crisis progressed. It will be seen that the survival of this constitutional principle\u2014and therefore the possibilities for its renewal\u2014still provided one of the most powerful unifying themes for both Conservative and Liberal Unionists in a period that is typically seen as one of flux and fragmentation. So despite the turn towards addressing new, extra-constitutional concerns\u2014and thus the relative decline of constitutional politics at the turn of the twentieth century\u2014we will see that \u2018constructive Conservatism\u2019 was not an approach confined to social, economic and imperial policy.Women\u2019s suffrage was not a strictly party-political issue. There were Conservative as well as Liberal suffragists in favour of radical constitutional reform: hence the creation of the Conservative and Unionist Women\u2019s Franchise Association.[CITATION-21] And, conversely, there were Liberal as well as Conservative opponents. Yet women\u2019s suffrage remained a constitutional issue which served to motivate many Unionists to speak out and put pen to paper, including many women for whom the issue\u2014and opposition to it\u2014provided an important platform for the vocalisation of their ideas. This is particularly pertinent when exploring proposals to maintain the constitution, and how these arguments compared to other schemes in a period that produced a high volume of constructive proposals for constitutional reform. Here, we are especially interested in the reasoned arguments and proposals for maintaining the existing constitutional settlement while increasing the voice of women in parliament known as the \u2018Forward Policy\u2019.Thanks to the work of Julia Bush, we know how anti-suffragists such as the leading Quaker writer Caroline Stephen (1834\u20131909) and Mary (Mrs Humphry) Ward\u2014offame\u2014could argue perfectly consistently against female enfranchisement, proposing instead, from 1907, the creation of a third \u2018Women\u2019s Chamber\u2019 in parliament.[CITATION-22] Such a reform appealed to anti-suffragists across the political spectrum because it was seen as a means of adapting to changed circumstances, and so increasing the public voice as well as the representation of women, while still retaining what was perceived to be the essential character of the constitution\u2014and, indeed, the essential character of feminine virtue. As Stephen proposed:My dream would be that a certain number of representative women (say two for each county) should meet during the session of Parliament to consider, revise, and suggest amendments to any Bills sent to them by either House, at its own discretion. These would, of course, be chiefly Bills relating to social subjects, and especially those peculiarly affecting women and children, e.g. educational, sanitary, and poor-law measures; such Bills to be returned to the House in which they originated, by which the women\u2019s suggestions could be either adopted or rejected as the House saw fit.[CITATION-23] The basic idea was to give women a voice on those matters deemed to be areas of women\u2019s particular \u2018expertise\u2019\u2014that is, social reform and education. Stephen\u2019s scheme was especially detailed and well laid out, based as it was on an existing structure that she knew well: the separate but reported women\u2019s meetings found in the Quaker movement.[CITATION-24] But the finer details were debated: Stephen wanted a democratically elected council with an electorate made up entirely of women\u2014married or single\u2014whereas Mary Ward (who became a Liberal Unionist during the first Home Rule crisis of 1886) suggested that the women\u2019s council should be constructed from the more limited pool of women already working in local government.[CITATION-25] Stephen and Ward were, therefore, actively constructing and publicising schemes of limited constitutional reform.Such solutions were partly based on counter-arguments that identified the problems of women reformers as having little to do with a need for \u2018revolutionary\u2019 constitutional reform. Commentators such as Mary Maxse, who chaired the Women\u2019s Unionist and Tariff Reform Association, argued in thethat the social and economic tribulations of women would be better served by trade unions and therefore through economic channels than through parliament.[CITATION-26] This was an argument put forward by both Liberal and Unionist anti-suffragists, including the Positivist Ethel Harrison (1851\u20131916) and her son, Austin, who supported the argument of both Maxse and his mother when he stated that \u2018What women want\u2019 is \u2018hardly politics at all. It is political economy\u2019.[CITATION-27] This type of argument was not new: it had been a crucial line of attack by Liberal Unionists such as Matthew Arnold during the first debates over Home Rule in the 1880s and 1890s, which was dubbed \u2018killing Home Rule with kindness\u2019.[CITATION-28] Proposals for targeted reforms to meet identifiable grievances, such as (in an Irish context) land or local government reform or (in this context) the creation of unions for women workers, aimed to deflect concern away from structural constitutional change and towards more pragmatic social and economic solutions. \u2018There was\u2019, Maxse argued, \u2018a vast amount of political work to do without possessing the doubtful privilege of the vote\u2019.[CITATION-29] These were not empty words: as David Thackeray demonstrates, Maxse\u2019s WUTRA\u2014unlike the more socially oriented Primrose League\u2014encouraged an ideologically driven form of activism from women. WUTRA speakers frequently shared platforms with male tariff reformers, and\u2014with regard to the defence of the union with Ireland\u2014the organisation played a leading role in the British Covenant campaign following the introduction of the Third Irish Home Rule Bill in 1912.[CITATION-30] It also meant that how one defined \u2018the cause of constitutional liberty\u2019 became a central point of contention. For anti-suffragists such as Harrison, English women were not \u2018slaves\u2019 in need of political liberation, but victims of an economic structure that could only be properly challenged by women banding together for better working conditions and pay, rather than for the vote. As we have just seen, this was also the argument of Maxse, writing in the, as well as of other well-known Liberal Unionist men of letters such as the constitutional lawyer A.V. Dicey, and the historian Goldwin Smith: true freedom for women would come in the form of improved labour conditions, not parliamentary suffrage.[CITATION-31] There was a further consideration to add here: might the freedom of women be different from that of men? To Caroline Stephen, the true personal freedom of women came from \u2018motherliness\u2019 and \u2018the domestic ideal\u2019: having the capacity to cast a vote for a member of parliament gave a person a \u2018minute fragment\u2019 of political power, but this was \u2018a very different thing from freedom\u2019.[CITATION-32] This was of course an essentialist argument based on conceptions of the differing strengths and weaknesses of men and women, but it connected the political and (British) constitutional ideals of liberty for women to a broader narrative of male and female capabilities which had the power and potential to persuade: since 1867, debates about the extension of the franchise had also considered a person\u2019s capacity to exercise power over others.[CITATION-33] Commentators were thus able to offer a multi-layered argument, composed of both practical solutions to perceived problems\u2014such as a lack of representation, or economic grievances\u2014as well as rebuttals and reinterpretations of concepts such as \u2018capacity\u2019 and \u2018liberty\u2019, which were absolutely central to arguments about reform, political change, constitutional history and national identity in British political discourse.[CITATION-34] Such arguments\u2014for the reform of abuses, the representation of interests, and for the preservation of specific conceptions of political liberty\u2014were not wholly original, but these older ideas were given new life by Liberal, Liberal Unionist, and Conservative anti-suffrage campaigners who worked together in making powerful constructive arguments against women\u2019s suffrage.Calls to reform the House of Lords were, similarly, not simply based on the principles or ideas of one party. There was widespread agreement that some reform of the upper house was necessary in order for it to function as an effective and respected second chamber. The reasoning behind these proposals was well expressed in 1909 by the constitutional historian and lawyer, William Sharp McKechnie. He wrote that:there are rival principles capable of being strengthened or revived in its composition, without doing violence to the historical traditions of a venerable institution which has, at more than one crisis in the past, advanced the cause of constitutional liberty, and may be destined to perform valuable services in the future.[CITATION-35] The essential constitutional role of the second chamber had, by this time, been widely identified as its scrutiny of the government in an age of efficient party whips, machines and caucuses. The desire to reform and thus strengthen the existing House of Lords led, for example, to calls to reduce\u2014but not abolish\u2014the number of hereditary peers in the upper chamber, as well as for the introduction of peers from unrepresented interests. To McKechnie, it was clear that, \u2018even if we look back to origins in Norman Curia Regis or the Witenagemot of Wessex\u2019, the House of Lords had not begun life as an assembly of hereditary rulers.[CITATION-36] This argument went back to the 1880s and to the Liberal Oxford Regius Professor of History, E.A. Freeman (1823\u201392), as well as to Lord Rosebery (Liberal Prime Minister, 1894\u20135), who adopted Freeman\u2019s reasoning in his calls for Lords reform. Freeman stated that it was only with the dissolution of the monasteries that hereditary peers became the majority in the House of Lords, as it was at this time that the abbots were ejected from the chamber.[CITATION-37] On this historical foundation lay the further claim that a second chamber consisting of a majority of hereditary peers was not the \u2018natural\u2019 or sole option when considering the composition of the House of Lords. This laid the intellectual groundwork for Conservative arguments that it would be possible to reform the composition of the Lords without damaging its essential character, or compromising the core \u2018organs\u2019 of the constitution, while improving its claims to represent the interests of the nation as a whole.It was on the topic of constitutional\u2014and more specifically Lords\u2014reform that many historians felt qualified to enter the debate. While McKechnie agreed that reform was essential, he also believed that to remove the hereditary peerage completely would be to remove an essential part of the constitution. It would, he argued, be the equivalent of removing the other essential component of the \u2018venerable\u2019 part of the constitution, the monarchy.[CITATION-38] Yet McKechnie went further even than Rosebery\u2019s 1908 report. Rosebery recommended a reduction of peers from 600 to 400, comprising 333 hereditary peers (130 \u2018qualified\u2019 by \u2018official experience\u2019, 200 selected by fellow peers but technically \u2018unqualified\u2019, and three royal princes), plus at most forty life peers, ten spiritual peers, four law lords, and perhaps six colonial representatives. McKechnie\u2019s scheme was similar, but reduced the hereditary element by half. His desire was to fill up seats vacated by a reduced hereditary peerage on the basis of the four principles of delegation, nomination, office, and election. On the first point, McKechnie believed hereditary peers should cut their current number (543) in half, delegating their authority to a smaller number of their own selection. On nomination, he suggested that individuals might be nominated for a peerage if they had held official posts or served the community in some way. The third principle was qualification by office: life peers should be chosen from a wide range of expertise, including the judiciary, military, and diplomatic services, as a way to combat the notion that a peerage was the reward of serving a particular government. The final principle\u2014election\u2014would have given outside bodies, such as governing bodies of municipal or parish councils, the power to elect peers.[CITATION-39] This was also the argument of the Oxford historian, university extension lecturer and Conservative MP J.A.R. Marriott (1859\u20131945). In 1907, he had proposed a scheme for transforming the House of Lords into an \u2018Imperial Senate\u2019, with the goal of strengthening the institution as a second chamber, as well as giving \u2018[British] Dominions direct representation in the Imperial Parliament\u2019. At the heart of the scheme was the admittance of new interests to the composition of the Lords, but it also suggested a compromise between the stance (for instance, of the old Benthamite Unionist Dicey) that demanded unitary parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster and the more extensive federalism of another Liberal Unionist, Lord Selborne, whose scheme for the constitutional development of the British Empire Marriott supported.[CITATION-40] Like McKechnie, his was essentially an argument for life peerages and the reform of the composition of the Lords:[R]eforms are obstructed by the refusal of the House of Lords to admit the principle of Life Peerages. Why should not the Agent-General of a Dominion, for instance, receive a Peerage tenable for the duration of his office, just as a Bishop is a Spiritual Peer only so long as he occupies a see?[CITATION-41] Nor was this intervention a one-off: Marriott\u2019s articles on the constitutional question, written for theandbetween 1907 and 1910, laid the foundation for his(1910), which stressed the universal acceptance of bicameral legislatures by all \u2018civilised\u2019 nations, and he remained committed to the principle of compositional reform until his death in 1940.[CITATION-42] Moreover,was, according to Marriott, the most widely reviewed and well received of his books: praise for this work came as freely from theas from, as well as international academic journals such as the.[CITATION-43] Such literature had a wide reach, addressing, as it did, not only Conservative and Unionist concerns about \u2018radical reform\u2019 such as Irish Home Rule, but also the contemporary concerns mentioned earlier regarding the control of party \u2018machinery\u2019 and the caucus, as well as the heightened power of the Prime Minister and the executive that resulted from this.[CITATION-44] Unsurprisingly, therefore, these discussions did not disappear after the 1911 Parliament Act, which removed the Lords\u2019 veto power and replaced it with a two-year delay. If anything, the removal of power from the Lords emphasised the need for further reconstruction, because there was (to critics\u2019 eyes) no longer any restriction on the power of the executive in the Commons, bolstered as it was by whips, caucuses and \u2018machines\u2019. \u2018In the House of Lords alone\u2019, wrote Theresa, sixth Marchioness of Londonderry (under the pseudonym, \u2018Not a Peer\u2019) to, \u2018can there be independence of thought\u2019 from the whips. The basis of such independence, she argued, was the guarantee of a seat for life or, at the very least, a \u2018definite period\u2019.[CITATION-45] Lord Hugh Cecil called for cross-party efforts to be made on the matter of Lords reform in hisof 1912, and he remained an active advocate beyond the outbreak of war in 1914. Both Liberals and Conservatives, he stated, should now construct a reformed second chamber that was in keeping with \u2018the character and traditions of the existing House of Lords, and in which some part should still be played by the principle of hereditary succession\u2019.[CITATION-46] Algernon Cecil (1879\u20131953) agreed with his cousin\u2019s conclusion in his review offor the, stating that the Lords must represent a \u2018true aristocracy\u2019\u2014that is, shedding light on, and leading with vision in, public affairs\u2014and not be reduced to a mere revising chamber.[CITATION-47] The barrister and Conservative candidate Sir Arthur Page[CITATION-48] also accepted that in the future the peerage might well be elected, but the fundamental question really was that of the powers of the second chamber, rather than its composition. Here the task was clear: \u2018it is the foremost and paramount duty of Unionists to work for the restoration of a Second Chamber with authority co-ordinate with that possessed by the House of Commons\u2019.[CITATION-49] For many Conservatives, as thejournalist and author Sidney Low explained (in an article entitled \u2018The End of the Old Constitution\u2019), a drastic \u2018remodelling\u2019 of the constitution was \u2018the greatest enterprise laid upon us in our political capacity since 1689\u2019.[CITATION-50] The proposals for House of Lords reform, from 1907, and the removal of the Lords\u2019 veto, after the 1911 Parliament Act, therefore gave rise to considerable concern for Conservatives who foretold the imminent demise of the political system without an effective second chamber. MPs and peers, including Arthur Page, Sir Robert Findlay, and Lords Cecil, Esher and Midleton, drew on these powerful historical examples when likening the post-1911 constitution to the failed unicameral legislatures of Revolutionary France and Cromwell\u2019s England.[CITATION-51] The Parliament Act also drew Marriott into a more direct form of political activity: not only did he put his pen into political service by producing highly charged, constitutionally focused periodical articles (primarily for), but he also played an active part in election campaigning on behalf of Lord Valentia in the 1910 elections, before finally winning a seat in parliament in 1917.[CITATION-52] Taken together, these texts and their authors demonstrate not only the importance of a reformed and effective second chamber\u2014and therefore a focus on the powers of the Lords\u2014to a Unionist vision of an ideal British political framework, but the significant intellectual effort to which many Unionists went in order to articulate and persuade others of these proposals.The best-known example of Conservative and Unionist willingness to adopt seriously innovative political processes is, however, that of the referendum. The introduction of the referendum would have departed significantly from the more established idea of the \u2018referendal\u2019 powers of the House of Lords associated with Lord Salisbury in the second half of the nineteenth century. The referendal theory upheld the distinct power of the Lords to refer a question to the nation through a general election, and thus related to parliamentary process, rather than to referendums as direct appeals to the whole country on specific questions. Yet the debate focused on the referendum in the latter sense was in some ways connected to the question of Lords reform: the referendum was posited as a means of avoiding gridlock between the House of Commons and a strengthened House of Lords, for instance. But the referendum debate was bigger than this, and historians have discussed the respective \u2018liberal\u2019 or \u2018conservative\u2019 origins of the turn towards the referendum from 1885 as well as the relationship between the referendum and the referendal theory.[CITATION-53] The central figure here was A.V. Dicey, who wrote a number of articles in support of referendums from 1886, the year of Gladstone\u2019s first Home Rule Bill and the year in which Dicey became a Liberal Unionist. His aim was to solve the \u2018political problem of the age\u2019: \u2018how to form conservative democracies\u2019. Dicey believed that the introduction of the referendum\u2014as used in Switzerland\u2014to British political and constitutional processes would provide \u2018the means of giving effect to democratic conservatism\u2019 and he corresponded frequently with Salisbury on the topic.[CITATION-54] Dicey was a democrat who believed in the principle of popular sovereignty, yet he saw the potential usefulness of the referendum as a practical means of resisting radical political change that lacked the consent of the nation.[CITATION-55] It was for this reason that another, less democratically minded, Liberal Unionist man of letters, W.E.H. Lecky, wrote in favour of employing the referendum against \u2018revolutionary\u2019 change to the British constitution in the new (1899) edition of his 1896 book,. His target was clear: the possibility of the \u2018factions\u2019 of Liberals, Labour and the Irish Parliamentary Party, which to him lacked all legitimacy, uniting to pass significant constitutional change by the barest of majorities. Lecky argued that, as the \u2018conservative influence of class and property\u2019 had declined, a new brake was now needed on the \u2018revolutionary\u2019 elements of the politics of the day.[CITATION-56] \u2018If the nation is moving towards revolution\u2019, he wrote, \u2018it should at least do so with its eyes open, and with clear and deliberate intent\u2019.[CITATION-57] These were the debates which lay behind calls to utilise the referendum during the late Edwardian period. Again, the urgency of the situation in Ireland crystallised thinking, and the referendum was seen as a defensive weapon against the \u2018revolutionary\u2019 Liberals in coalition with the Irish Home Rulers, as well as a means to solve practical disagreements within the Unionist alliance. The possibility of holding a referendum was suggested in a bid to resolve the ongoing constitutional question of Home Rule for Ireland, and also the divisive issue of tariff reform. Much to the consternation of Austen Chamberlain, Balfour famously pledged to hold a referendum on the latter in the run up to the December 1910 election.[CITATION-58] This had been the suggestion of tariff reformers such as Bonar Law, who was supported by the younger figures of F.E. Smith, John Buchan and Noel Skelton.[CITATION-59] One explanation for this is, of course, pragmatism: that the referendum was seen as offering a practical means of healing and uniting the party after the divisions over tariff reform. But there was more to it than this: the introduction of the referendum would have brought into being a significant new political mechanism that needed intellectual as well as pragmatic justification, especially for Conservatives. Balfour explained his reasoning for holding a referendum to his niece in 1929, stating that his decision was based on a belief that the more responsibility possessed by the whole community, the more inclined it would be to continuity rather than change: \u2018in fact the countries where there is real universal suffrage prove my point\u2014look at Switzerland\u2014where the referendum is used and always in a Conservative sense\u2019. This was, he noted, his idea of \u2018Tory Democracy\u2019.[CITATION-60] Skelton\u2014who is now primarily known for hisof 1924, which coined and articulated the concept of \u2018property-owning democracy\u2019\u2014was closely connected to Balfour as well as John St Loe Strachey of the Unionist(who had supported the referendum along the same lines as Dicey). Into the 1920s, Skelton repeated appeals to secure the constitution through the referendum: one of the consequences of the Third Reform Acts was not only that the electorate was \u2018mass\u2019 but, for the first time, propertyless.[CITATION-61] The appeal of the referendum to Unionists such as Dicey and Lecky and Conservatives such as Balfour and Skelton was therefore based on the conservative possibilities of newer constitutional mechanisms.The view that the referendum was a \u2018conservative\u2019 measure was not, of course, held by all Conservatives. \u2018Mainstream Conservatives\u2019 such as Lord Curzon\u2014who did support Lords reform\u2014were strongly opposed to what they considered to be \u2018revolutionary\u2019 constitutional mechanisms such as referendums.[CITATION-62] Likewise, McKechnie rejected the referendum outright. The reasoning McKechnie employed will be familiar to twenty-first-century readers: the possibility of popular apathy and low turnouts; voters\u2019 potential ignorance of the issues involved; a possible absence of popular discussion; a potential lowering of the sense of responsibility among legislators. Moreover, the supposed simplicity of referendums was, to McKechnie, questionable.[CITATION-63] The, in its review of McKechnie\u2019s book on Lords reform, concurred, stating \u2018We have no wish to see by the introduction of \u201cplebiscite\u201d or \u201creferendum,\u201d or \u201cwritten Constitution\u201d\u2019, all of which represented \u2018the fundamental reversal of principles upon which our Parliamentary institutions have always rested\u2019. It was for this reason that the\u2018cordially welcome[d]\u2019 McKechnie\u2019s proposals for Lords reform, as well as \u2018the spirit of practical reform and true Conservatism in which they are made\u2019.[CITATION-64] What this meant, of course, was that there were profound differences between Unionists, as well as among their Liberal opponents, about the extent to which the introduction of the referendum would fundamentally alter the character of representative, parliamentary, constitutional politics, which it was their duty to protect.Amid the relative sweetness and light of constructive constitutional reform, there was a darker side to Unionist resistance in the late Edwardian period, following the introduction of the Third Home Rule Bill in 1912. The literature on Tory rebels and Unionist diehards will be familiar to historians of this period, and of the Conservative party more generally.[CITATION-65] How is one to reconcile principled defence of the constitution with the non- or extra-constitutional actions associated with Sir Edward Carson\u2019s Ulster Covenant campaign, complete with its own volunteer army? Unionists argued that the \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 tactics of the Liberal government, which, in their eyes, had gone beyond the limits of its authority (being supported, as it was, by \u2018factions\u2019 of Irish Home Rulers and Labour), had led to a situation in which the constitution was \u2018in suspense\u2019. The Liberals were acting, in Bonar Law\u2019s words, \u2018not as a Government, but as autocrats\u2019; a \u2018revolutionary committee which has seized by fraud upon despotic power\u2019.[CITATION-66] The paradox is that, in failing to follow purely parliamentary, non-militarised courses of action, Unionists were using unconstitutional methods to uphold a constitutional principle. Yet here we need to understand contemporary Unionist perceptions of their opponents, and the heightened sense of genuine danger and fear they engendered. An examination of the wider rhetorical and intellectual culture generated in this period illustrates that\u2014beyond the Ulster Covenant campaign\u2014the fear of \u2018revolution\u2019 really did reach fever pitch.Contemplating women\u2019s suffrage in 1883, thewarned its readers that \u2018Theof the First Revolution and theof the Commune had relapsed even more completely into barbarism than their male associates\u2019. Such a line of attack appealed to anti-suffragists of all stripes\u2014Liberal as well as Conservative. Ethel Harrison, for example, charted the recent growth of the \u2018women\u2019s rights\u2019 campaign from what \u2018the French call \u201c\u201d\u2019 in her(1908). To Harrison, this movement was a \u2018hybrid culture from seed sown by the French Revolution, when the doctrine of \u201cRights\u201d rode rampant over mankind\u2019.[CITATION-67] The rather more conservativequoted this passage and endorsed it wholeheartedly.[CITATION-68] Once again, by 1912, images such as \u2018The Storming of the Bastille\u2014New Style\u2019 (), demonstrated the salience in times of crisis of historical analogies to Revolutionary France: the suffragettes are pictured here storming the Bastille on 14 July 1912. By happy coincidence, this was\u2014the caption claimed\u2014Emmeline Pankhurst\u2019s birthday.[CITATION-69] Women\u2019s suffrage could then be fitted into \u2018a general revolutionary movement\u2019 that included the rise of socialism and the campaign for Irish Home Rule and which, according to the Liberal Unionist and one-time Regius Professor of History at Oxford, Goldwin Smith, it was \u2018hardly the vocation of Conservatives to promote\u2019.[CITATION-70] \u2018The Storming of the Bastille\u2014New Style\u2019,, no. 46 (Aug. 1912), p. 187. British Library, LB.31.b.15990 \u00a9 British Library Board.The resistance to the modern-day Jacobins was linked to Conservatism proper by figures such as Lord Hugh Cecil. Cecil argued, for instance, that the Revolution brought modern Conservatism into existence, and it was this Revolutionary aspect that remained the call to arms for Conservatives everywhere: \u2018Conservatism arose to resist Jacobinism, and that is to this day its most essential and fundamental characteristic\u2019.[CITATION-71] This call to arms did not go unnoticed. Marriott recalled that, after his period of political uncertainty over tariff reform and free trade, and as the constitutional crisis over the Lords mounted\u2014\u2018As the sound of battle mounted higher and higher\u2019\u2014he was more and more \u2018tempted to throw off academic restraints and re-enter the political arena\u2019:The great issues at stake\u2014the maintenance of the Union between Great Britain and Ireland, the preservation of a Second Chamber as a check upon unicameral omnipotence of the House of Commons, and the preservation of private property and individual initiative\u2014seemed to me vital; I was eager to do battle for them.[CITATION-72] This was not, however, a straightforwardly anti-democratic argument: it was based on the notion that, in overstepping their legitimate constitutional power, the Liberal \u2018revolutionaries\u2019 were also opposing the \u2018will of the people\u2019, which had not given the Liberals a parliamentary majority\u2014and therefore a mandate\u2014on Home Rule in either of the 1910 elections.[CITATION-73] Hence the issue of the removal of the Lords\u2019 veto\u2014in which, as we have seen, the need to defend the existing powers of the Lords became central\u2014was not simply about preserving elite power but rather about defending democratic representative institutions and (of course) the Union with Ireland. Whether all Unionists believed in their democratic arguments\u2014including those in favour of the referendum\u2014is obviously questionable. But in terms of political argument, in reducing the status and power of the Lords the Liberal government drove many Unionists\u2014of all types\u2014to the further articulation of an anti-revolutionary argument. As William Barry, both a Catholic and a fervent English constitutionalist, wrote: \u2018this coming controversy hangs on great decisive alternatives which, if we give them historical names, may be summed [up] in a phrase, \u201cRousseau or Burke?\u201d And on them the Referendum should be taken\u2019.[CITATION-74] His vote went firmly with Burke, but Barry despaired that, though Burke had delayed \u2018French Revolution\u2019 in the 1790s, he had only been able to do so for a hundred years: that dreaded moment in time was now approaching.[CITATION-75] It is therefore significant that this was the context in which Edmund Burke was decisively established as \u2018the founder of modern conservatism\u2019.[CITATION-76] More importantly, this was not simply an academic argument: it had power precisely because the constitution held a fixed place in the national as well as the Unionist imagination. The idea of the constitution had the potential to influence broader political discussions thanks to the continued centrality of constitutional history in school, university and adult education (including that taught by Marriott), and the popular images of John Bull and Britannia used in political posters and cartoons were as familiar to Edwardians as to early Victorians.[CITATION-77] Other images, such as the \u2018The Greedy Hand!\u2019 by G.R. Halkett (), first published in thein 1910, were intended to send a powerful message about British liberty, its relationship to parliamentary and religious institutions, and therefore the need to protect and defend those institutions which were not simply national, but imperial\u2014hence the rhetorical and argumentative power of Unionist and broader anti-suffrage usage of the term \u2018Imperial Parliament\u2019 (as compared to \u2018Westminster Parliament\u2019), with its connotations of global power and prestige.[CITATION-78] All of these were under attack from Halkett\u2019s radical-cum-biblical serpent which was now in control of a (bare) parliamentary majority.G.R. Halkett, \u2018The Greedy Hand!\u2019,, vi (December 1910). British Library, Lou.Lon.815 \u00a9 British Library Board.The anti-revolutionary argument provided Conservatives with significant intellectual ammunition against their \u2018radical\u2019 opponents. It connected the aims and motives of reformers with bloodthirsty and supposedly un-English methods and notions of effective political change. This allowed Unionists to argue convincingly that they were living in exceptional times. It was therefore clever and tactical as well as negative and reactionary. Yet these claims were not entirely divorced from democratic argument: Barry, for example, invoked \u2018revolution\u2019 as the central reason for the need to hold a referendum. Similarly, it is the \u2018electors\u2019 who are tasked with restraining Halkett\u2019s radical \u2018greedy hand\u2019. In both examples the Lords\u2019 veto is the mechanism, but it is not the locus of political legitimacy\u2014the trust lies in the hands of the electors, or \u2018the people\u2019. This was not pure pragmatism: the genuine belief, passion and principle is just as clear. The argument was part of a wider movement in which Conservatives were beginning to reimagine their histories and principles beyond Home Rule and Ulster. These pressing, vital concerns nonetheless produced historical arguments and analogies that were usable not only to attack opponents and defend national institutions, but also to align Unionist thinking with important constitutional conservatives (and famous anti-revolutionaries), such as Edmund Burke, in ways which had a significant lasting impact.The aim of this article has been to demonstrate some of the imaginative ways in which Unionists, both Liberal and Conservative, articulated in published texts proposals for constructive constitutional reform that were intended to defend (and therefore maintain) the constitution\u2014particularly in the wake of the Liberal landslide of 1906. This was not just about the parliamentary party and its leaders, but about Unionism in its broader sense, involving texts written by historians, commentators and journalists as much as politicians. The constitution and its defence, or maintenance, clearly remained both a central concern and a point of identification for many Unionists, despite the more recent challenges of socialism and the Labour movement. However, we should think about \u2018defence\u2019 in a multitude of ways and not simply as static support for the.By looking at Conservative and Unionist intellectual culture, we can expand our understanding of what proponents thought it meant to be a Conservative or Unionist in the late Victorian and Edwardian period, as well as of types of Conservative or Unionist political argument. Most obviously, it is clear that Conservatives created usable narratives of the past to explain their attitudes towards the constitution. Indeed, although conservatism\u2014and, in some guises, Conservatism\u2014is often associated with tradition or a sense of the importance of history over abstract thought, what we see here is not only expressed principle, but historically charged political argument addressing contemporary issues and demonstrating the interaction of principle and practice (although the use of historical analogies and the construction of historical genealogies is by no means an exclusively Conservative practice). We can also see how female Unionists used the constitutional crisis to frame ideas about the role of women in politics. The periodical press was an outlet for Conservatives and Unionists of all types\u2014maverick, mainstream, or otherwise. It is difficult (outside reviews and internal periodical debates) to get a sense of how these ideas were received, but it is clear that periodicals and published texts benefited from an ever-expanding reading audience, in which Unionists were themselves prominent.Finally, it is important to comment on the intellectual relationship between Liberal and Conservative Unionists in this period. Clearly, there was intellectual synergy between Liberal Unionists and Conservatives, as well as between late Victorian Liberal and Edwardian Conservative arguments for constitutional reform. But we cannot suppose that Liberal Unionists such as Dicey\u2014whose Liberal Unionism was not based on a conservatism developed in old age, but on both a democratic principle and a Benthamite belief in unitary sovereignty developed as a young man\u2014and Conservatives such as Balfour, Marriott, or Skelton looked to constitutional maintenance with the same goals in mind. This is not an essential weakness or a problem demanding neat resolution: political parties in a two-party system are necessarily broad churches, and both Conservative ideas and politics were fluid and thus open to reinterpretation. It is worth noting, however, that younger Conservative Unionists such as Skelton supported both progressive or radical constitutional forms and more extensive state involvement with social and housing reform. Hence, while Skelton continued to believe in the positive aspects of introducing the referendum after 1918, he also developed his own version of constructive Conservatism, which included, as previously noted, his desire to create a \u2018property-owning democracy\u2019.[CITATION-79] That said, we know that the referendum pledge was in the end dropped. Though Jennie Churchill\u2019s son, Winston, toyed with the notion of holding a referendum on the possibility of continuing the wartime coalition in 1945, Britons had to wait until 1975 to experience their first modern plebiscite.[CITATION-80] The women\u2019s chamber also failed to materialise, although significant figures such as Lucy Baldwin remained interested in the idea of a \u2018Women\u2019s Council\u2019 devoted to the affairs of mothers and children even after suffrage had been won.[CITATION-81] The hereditary peerage was, of course, eventually reduced, but this was not twinned with a significant boost to the essential powers of the second chamber\u2014though life peerages (twinned with a seat in the Lords) were introduced by Macmillan\u2019s Conservative government in 1958. What might be perceived as sluggishness was in large part the product of a post-war context in which\u2014thanks to Liberal decline, the rise of a distinctly parliamentary Labour Party, and broader European instability\u2014constitutionalism gained a much clearer identity both in its connection to Conservatism and as a perceived pillar of the English or British national character. In comparison to other European countries\u2014France and Italy especially\u2014far-right movements in Britain made limited progress: commentators such as the modernist (and anti-parliamentary) reactionaries portrayed in Tom Villis\u2019swere always marginal figures.[CITATION-82] Hence, it would be hard to deny that constitutional principles remained central to Conservatives in this period and beyond. In fact, the intellectual culture produced by late Victorian and Edwardian Unionism demonstrates the constructive and imaginative ways in which the protection and \u2018maintenance\u2019 of the constitution could be conceived through both the recognition and adoption of democratic modes of political legitimation and argument, and the construction of novel histories and genealogies. Conservatives and Unionists\u2014men and women, historians, novelists, journalists, MPs and peers\u2014were themselves reinventing, intellectually as well as politically, who they were, who they were not, and who they wanted to be.",
