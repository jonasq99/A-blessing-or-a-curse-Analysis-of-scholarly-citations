    "article": "Neither the idea that Britain \u2018stood alone\u2019 in 1940, nor that the British war was a \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019, were at all common during the Second World War. If anything was thought to be \u2018alone\u2019, it was the empire, though the more common view was that the empire always had allies. \u2018People\u2019s war\u2019 was a rare synonym for \u2018total war\u2019 and was sometimes used in an internationalist sense of a war of many peoples, and as the sort of war Britain should be, but was not, fighting. However, from 1945 a national \u2018alone\u2019 came into usage, for example by Churchill; but only from the 1960s was it a commonplace in history books. \u2018People\u2019s war\u2019 became more widely used in histories written in the 1960s, which defined it in a national progressive sense, although the term did not become common until the 1990s. Both ideas were essentially the creations of historians, who nationalised the history of what was an imperial and internationalist war, often turning it into a radically different domestic story focused on a national Home Front (ignoring the many imperial home fronts), a story which marginalised the military, foreign and political history of the war, and indeed the social history of the military as well. Historians later assumed that \u2018alone\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 represented wartime nationalist ideologies, and wrote about them critically. Yet until recently they did not recognise that it was the very particular nature of the histories written in the 1960s which had generated these terms, and which embodied very particular analyses of British history and of the Second World War. The paper ends by arguing that much greater understanding is needed of the core assumptions which lie beneath the historiography of twentieth-century Britain.Historians have recently recognised that, for the United Kingdom, the Second World War was an imperial and international conflict, not a national war.[CITATION-1] This conclusion is beginning to supersede the national reading previously dominant in twentieth- and early twenty-first century historical scholarship. This article explores the process by which the war first came to be seen as national. This did not, as is often implied and assumed, happen during the war itself. My argument is that social and political historians, operating in a post-1945 national context, began to see 1940 as the moment in which a new nation, with a progressive politics based on welfare, was created; they deployed the idea that \u2018Britain was alone\u2019 and the notion of the \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 to express and explain this development. The national \u2018alone\u2019 was a concept which first emerged in 1945, but only appeared regularly in histories of the war from the late 1960s; the idea of a national \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was created by historians in the late 1960s, becoming popular two decades later. From the 1990s onwards, cultural historians, basing their analyses on these earlier histories, developed the argument that 1940 was a left nationalist moment during which what were by now regarded as myths of being \u2018alone\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 were widely diffused and believed. They correctly saw these notions as ideological and powerful. However, they were concepts which barely existed in 1940 or even later in the war: when \u2018alone\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 were used by wartime contemporaries, these terms had very different meanings to those assumed by post-war historians. \u2018Alone\u2019, when used during the war, usually referred to the British Empire, not the nation. \u2018People\u2019s war\u2019 as a wartime phrase referred not to the actual war the British people were fighting, but to a general understanding of the nature of the war, often with a powerful internationalist slant. When used about the British war effort during the war itself, \u2018peoples\u2019 war\u2019 was a critical and oppositional, rather than an official-celebratory, conception. Thus I disagree with the claim that persistent and pernicious nationalist wartime myths of \u2018alone\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 were challenged by historians from the 1960s onwards.[CITATION-2] Rather, I argue that these myths were in fact created by historians themselves, and were, somewhat paradoxically, later sustained and extended by other historians who were criticising these myths. I follow some recent literature in stressing that understanding of the war changed over time, and suggest it did so radically.[CITATION-3] The key political and social histories of the war written in the 1960s and 1970s were built on very particular assumptions. To be sure, there has been much rich work criticising aspects of these accounts, for example on wartime social policy, or the place of Labour in wartime politics.[CITATION-4] But most scholarship, including later cultural histories, has stayed within the surprisingly powerful and invisible frameworks established by interpretations developed in the 1960s and 1970s.[CITATION-5] Firstly we need to register that these were national histories. \u2018Britain Alone\u2019 may now seem an absurd idea, but the notion that the nation rather than the empire mattered, ideologically, economically, politically and militarily, was a distinctive interpretative framework with important implications.[CITATION-6] Secondly, they focused on a particular story of the coming together of the people: \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was the summary view of a war seen by historians in the 1960s and 1970s as a matter of the willing mobilisation of the people of the nation in a common national struggle which was understood as such, where the left and developments in welfare played a crucial role, a distinct thesis which omitted the armed forces, and the right. Only in the recent past have military and economic historians, in particular, questioned these orthodoxies, not only stressing the war\u2019s international and imperial nature, but also challenging the assumptions made about the domestic aspects of the war, including ideology.[CITATION-7] This article takes that critique forward by demonstrating the post-war construction of these arguments, and by criticising more recent cultural history for reproducing its assumptions, and for not recognising the crucial transformations these 1960s and 1970s histories effected. It also argues that the focus in the literature on \u2018national identity\u2019 has limited our understanding of British identities before 1945 by not recognising that imperial and internationalist identities were crucial for parts of the elite, and in propaganda.[CITATION-8] I also suggest the need to recognise the significance of British anti-imperialist nationalism, not least of the left, especially (but not only) after 1945, if we are to understand the development of the historiography of twentieth-century Britain, including that of the war itself. I am not merely quibbling with what I show to be profoundly anachronistic usages of historiographic terms of art, but rather showing that their coining and use are not innocent formulations. Instead they arose from the grip which particular historiographical traditions have exerted on our understanding of twentieth-century British history.The article proceeds as follows. I first examine the extent and nature of the usages \u2018alone\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 during the war. I then move on to considering how, initially, the national \u2018alone\u2019 and then later \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 appeared in historical literature. From there I go on to show how cultural historians in particular developed the idea of a wartime ideology centred on \u2018alone\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019, backed up by a particular analysis of the wartime writings of J.B. Priestley and George Orwell. Contrary to the readings of some cultural historians, I show that Priestley\u2019s output had an important imperial and internationalist dimension and Orwell was not claiming that a new left nationalism existed, but rather that an existing conservative one was strengthened; he also exemplified a new critical nationalism. I then move on to reflect on the historiographical implications of these arguments.While the idea that something called \u2018Britain\u2019 did indeed stand \u2018alone\u2019 in 1940 still sometimes finds expression, most professional historians now regard this as a vulgar error. But many, as I discuss below, believe that this was what the British people were told and believed during the war itself. Supporting evidence for the existence of a sense among wartime contemporaries of Britain being \u2018alone\u2019 as a nation in 1940\u201341 has been invoked by such scholars.[CITATION-9] Richard Weight\u2019sis particularly rich in cases, and is unusual because he is aware that an imperial rather than a national sense of common identity could have been in play; but he argues that the prevalence of \u2018alone\u2019 was itself evidence of the waning of imperial feeling, and that the dominant meaning of \u2018alone\u2019 was indeed a national one.[CITATION-10] He cites the famous \u2018Very well, alone\u2019 cartoon by David Low (published in June 1940 in the), noting that \u2018Churchill always portrayed the British as an island people: outward-looking; in need of Imperial and American aid; but ultimately self-reliant. The most memorable phrase of the speech he delivered\u2014the promise to \u201cfight them on the beaches\u201d\u2014resonated for precisely that reason\u2019.[CITATION-11] He suggests that for J.B. Priestley the sea was the national seaside rather than the great oceans dominated by British trade.[CITATION-12] Yet once we look closely, evidence for a national \u2018alone\u2019 is scanty, and indirect.[CITATION-13] Many arguments which look like a reference or an allusion to, or an expression of, an underlying national \u2018alone\u2019 turn out to be ambiguous at best: there are some which are clear and are noted below, but they are exceedingly rare.[CITATION-14] Let us first consider the Low cartoon. It does not specifywas alone and, in a commentary on a version republished a little later in 1940, Low (a New Zealander employed by a Canadian, Lord Beaverbrook) noted: \u2018Assured of increasing support in supplies and munitions from the United States, and especially of planes and pilots from the Dominions, Britain determined to fight on alone\u2019.[CITATION-15] This does suggest a national conception of \u2018alone\u2019, but it is contradicted by the references to the outside world that Low\u2019s own commentary contains, that Britain was in fact far from being alone. Even more to the point, the key image in the cartoon is not so much that of being alone as of military defiance. This was indeed a commonplace. Following the fall of France in late June 1940, there was much defensive imagery: of an island fortress, a citadel, a bastion, a garrison, the white cliffs of Dover as ramparts.[CITATION-16] These did not imply a national \u2018alone\u2019: they were usually associated with an entity larger than the nation, such as empire, Europe or the realm of freedom, civilisation and indeed sometimes Christian civilisation.[CITATION-17] For example, the idea of an island \u2018Fortress\u2019to be found in Cato\u2019sa denunciation of former British government policy towards Nazi Germany, published in July 1940; but \u2018alone\u2019 isthere.[CITATION-18] The historian, journalist and imperialist Arthur Bryant noted, without any reference to \u2018alone\u2019, that \u2018An island fortress, England is fighting a war of redemption not only for Europe, but for her own soul\u2019.[CITATION-19] J.B. Priestley\u2019s radiobroadcasts repeatedly invoked empire and commonwealth, and the fortress image, but with no assertion of a national \u2018alone\u2019.[CITATION-20] Thus on 9 June he spoke of wishing to send \u2018all our children out of this island \u2026 to the wide Dominions\u2019 and turning Britain into \u2018the greatest fortress the world has ever known\u2019.[CITATION-21] In his(1941), \u2018alone\u2019 did not figure either; but this did: the \u2018very core, the hard centre of world resistance to the Nazis is found in this real England, this democratic industrial England\u2019. Here we should note \u2018resistance\u2019, and the use of \u2018England\u2019, another case of slippage in terminology.[CITATION-22] For Arthur Mee, \u2018the Island stands as the Lighthouse of the World\u2019, part of a great liberal and Christian empire.[CITATION-23] Occasionally, the idea of the fortress and being alone were combined; but what was usually perceived as being alone was the empire, not the nation. Narrating the film(1940), Priestley refers to Britain \u2018alone\u2019, \u2018at bay\u2019, as an \u2018island fortress\u2019, but, while making no explicit spoken reference to empire, the film shows troops from the Dominions in Britain., a series of short propaganda newsreel films, was strikingly imperial, with, as was common, a particular emphasis on the white Dominions. Within this context one might get a reference, such as in, that \u2018the free democracy of Great Britain alone faces the enemy\u2019, but empire was constantly referenced, as was the idea of Britain as a fortress.[CITATION-24] has \u2018lone\u2019 which refers both to empire and British isles.[CITATION-25] put it straightforwardly: \u2018Now that we are making a fortress of these islands \u2026 this empire stands alone\u2019.[CITATION-26] Indeed the image of a united empire fighting together (and only sometimes alone), was widely diffused in 1940 and 1941. For Fougasse, in a cartoon inof 17 July 1940, it was the \u2018poor old empire\u2019 which was \u2018alone in the world\u2019, \u2018all five hundred millions of us\u2019.[CITATION-27] As France was falling,carried the message \u2018We Fight on\u2019, using an imperial \u2018we\u2019.[CITATION-28] It reported from Parliament on Churchill\u2019s \u2018Finest Hour\u2019 speech of 18 June with the subheadings \u2018BRITISH EMPIRE TO FIGHT ON\u2019 and \u2018OUR ISLAND GARRISON\u2019.[CITATION-29] In this and earlier speeches, Churchill indicated that the empire would fight on, \u2018if necessary, and if necessary alone\u2019.[CITATION-30] In private, on the eve of the evacuations from Dunkirk, he instructed his ministers and officials \u2018whatever may happen on the Continent \u2026 we shall certainly use all our power to defend the Island, the Empire and our Cause\u2019.[CITATION-31] In his \u2018Few\u2019 speech to the House of Commons on 20 August 1940, he referred to \u2018The British nation and the British Empire finding themselves alone\u2019.[CITATION-32] Churchill, or any other prime minister, was hardly likely not to invoke that mighty body at such a time. Indeed, in his official declaration of the end of the war in Europe in the House of Commons he recounted: \u2018After gallant France had been struck down we, from this Island and from our united Empire, maintained the struggle single-handed for a whole year until we were joined by the military might of Soviet Russia\u2019.[CITATION-33] Churchill generally used an imperial \u2018we\u2019.It should not now be surprising that if anything was alone, it was the empire. The empire was constantly referred to in propaganda, in news broadcasts, in newsreels and in the newspapers. It was very present as a place where British troops came from and were stationed. For Conservatives especially, the empire, not the nation, was the central unit of reference.[CITATION-34] For example, on 26 May 1940 there was a \u2018Day of national prayer on behalf of the nation and Empire, their allies and the cause in which they are united\u2019 observed throughout the empire.[CITATION-35] In standard usage, the British Empire and/or Commonwealth usually included the United Kingdom, Great Britain, England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, which were seen parts of a greater, liberal and global British Empire, one understood as being not only non-nationalist but anti-nationalist.[CITATION-36] Thus it was that the Imperial General Staff, the Imperial War Museum and the Imperial War Graves Commission were mainly concerned with the UK. It is impossible to understand wartime discussion without understanding the fluidity and overlapping and changing nature of definitions of empire and nation. For example, Arthur Mee wrote of the \u2018the Island and the Empire\u2019 and repeatedly invoked empire alongside and above nation, England, Britain.[CITATION-37] Priestley\u2019s wartime talks have many examples of identification with the larger empire and commonwealth:[CITATION-38] in hisof 23 June he spoke of the \u2018kindness of England, of Britain, of the wide Empire forever reaching out towards new expressions of Freedom\u2019.[CITATION-39] On 21 July, he referred to \u2018the British and their allied peoples\u2019.[CITATION-40] On 1 September he noted his surprise that \u2018the British Commonwealth alone would be defying both the Nazis and the Fascists\u2019.[CITATION-41] A week later he invoked the British diaspora within and outside the empire, from the Straits of Magellan to Africa, which he described as \u2018our own folk\u2019.[CITATION-42] To complicate matters, the terms \u2018British\u2019 and even \u2018English\u2019 could refer not only to the United Kingdom or England, but the empire also.[CITATION-43] Thus it is not entirely clear whether in the poem published in thein September 1940 Dorothy L. Sayers was using a national England or a wider concept. She wrote: \u2018When no allies are left, no help / To count upon from alien hands, \u2026 only England stands \u2026 To fight the English war\u2019. But, there were references to a global maritime \u2018England\u2019 in the poem and an element of hostility to Irish neutrality as well.[CITATION-44] This is suggestive, for Ireland was still, in the official British view, part of the Commonwealth. When Mee referred to \u2018the Island\u2019 he explicitly excluded Irishmen and Ireland from the bearers of the \u2018spirit of our race\u2019.[CITATION-45] Even for imperialists, and in government propaganda, the idea that the empire stood alone was far from universal; it could be supplemented or even replaced by a more internationalist perspective. For some, including Arthur Mee, the world was divided into a Christian world of Liberty and a world conquered by pagan Nazism. Writing of the Blitz, he expressed both an imperial and internationalist viewpoint: \u2018The Spirit of Whitechapel and Mile End and Bermondsey and Rotherhithe have become factors in the fate of all mankind. It is not only Yorkshire and Devon and Capetown [] and Sydney and Ottawa that thrill when they read of the courage of East London folk, but in far-off cities and lonely hamlets where our flag has never flown heart reverberates to heart and the flame of freedom burns brighter. \u2026 Not even the angels in heaven can be unmoved by the spectacle of the Capital, the Island, and the Empire, now\u2019.[CITATION-46] Much British propaganda argued that the empire had manyallies left. A telling example was the popular National Anthems Programme, which played on the BBC featuring the anthems of allied nations. On 12 May 1940 the anthems of the Netherlands and Belgium were added, and many others followed until the programme was forced off the air in June 1941 by the invasion of the Soviet Union: it was deemed unacceptable to broadcast the then state anthem of the Soviet Union, the. The programme was thus on air only in the \u2018alone\u2019 years.[CITATION-47] The Boulting brothers\u2019 film,(1941), has a Home Guard soldier noting that Europeans have united to fight Hitler,Dunkirk. A February 1941 newsreel shows Churchill with Generals de Gaulle and Sikorski watching a demonstration of British tanks. The British Gaumont newsreel report of the Inter-Allied conference of 12 June 1941 speaks \u2018of all the nations that stand beside Britain in the fight against Nazism\u2019 and reports a vigorous speech by Churchill denouncing the \u2018vile race of quislings\u2019 who were collaborating with the Nazis.[CITATION-48] The conference brought together the British Empire leaders, with the heads of the governments in exile of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, the Free French, Norway, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Yugoslavia and Greece.[CITATION-49] Posters from the conference show the flags of these allied nations. The war was, it needs to be added, often presented in this period as being in part a European civil war, rather than a war of nations.[CITATION-50] The very propagandistic Path\u00e9 and Movietone newsreel reviews of the year 1940 have no sense of \u2018alone\u2019 and report on the fall of France with references to General de Gaulle (in the case of Movietone) fighting on \u2018beside Britain\u2019. Both refer to the USA, to Greek resistance, and make multiple references to empire. Path\u00e9 describes St Paul\u2019s Cathedral as \u2018the Mother Church of Empire\u2019. The reviews of 1941 have no sense of the nation or empire having been alone, and again make multiple references to allies.[CITATION-51] The wartime left, as one would expect, did not speak of the nation being alone, but of a common struggle against fascism. This was true of George Orwell\u2019s, written in 1940, which had no \u2018alone\u2019, and referred to the empire, the Chinese fighting fascism, and the engagement of the Greeks from 1940.[CITATION-52] Cassandra, in, had no \u2018alone\u2019.[CITATION-53] Clement Attlee made a speech to the Labour Party Conference just before Operation Barbarossa, in which he noted, using a national rather than imperial \u2018we\u2019: \u2018Outside this country most people thought that Britain was hopelessly beaten. It looked as if we stood alone. But we were not alone. We had the other countries of the British Commonwealth\u2014(cheers)\u2014and the peoples of the Empire. We had something more than that: we had the sympathies of all the lovers of freedom all over the world\u2019. He noted that there was a realisation in North and South America, that \u2018Britain was not standing alone and that she was the spearhead of democracy and civilisation against barbarism\u2019.[CITATION-54] It seems a national or imperial \u2018alone\u2019 was as rare in private as in public. The now-published Home intelligence reports note barely any \u2018alone\u2019 at all, and none which indicate a national alone.[CITATION-55] Eric Estorick, reporting on morale to the USA, mentions neither \u2018alone\u2019, nor \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019.[CITATION-56] Sources connected to the political elite suggest some evidence for an imperial alone together with anti-French feeling. For example, the permanent undersecretary of the Foreign Office recorded in his diary that \u2018it will almost be a relief when we are left alone to fight the Devil and win or die\u2019; there is no evidence that \u2018we\u2019 here referred to the nation.[CITATION-57] Neville Chamberlain told his sister that \u2018We are in fact alone and we are at any rate free of our obligations to the French who have been nothing but a liability to us. It would have been far better if they had been neutral from the beginning\u2019.[CITATION-58] John Colville, Churchill\u2019s private secretary, has no \u2018alone\u2019 in his diary but recalled a brief bout of Francophobia.[CITATION-59] The imperial aspect is clearly present in the common theme of the possibility of continuing to fight from the rest of the empire, suggesting that having one\u2019s \u2018back to the wall\u2019\u2014a term sometimes used\u2014referred to a very large global wall.[CITATION-60] Less elite sources are silent on \u2018alone\u2019. The mass observer Nella Last felt personally naked and alone on the eve of the collapse of France, but there is no national or imperial alone in her published diary.[CITATION-61] The diary of Vere Hodgson has no \u2018alone\u2019 (and no \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019). It is only on 22 June 1941 that she is struck by the \u2018melancholy truth\u2019 that it is the first time in centuries that Britain is fighting without a single fighting ally in Europe (having read Garvin in the). That very morning, she hears that Russia had been invaded and \u2018felt my morale rising\u2019.[CITATION-62] Diaries preserved on the BBC \u2018People\u2019s War\u2019 website have minimal explicit references to, or even a general sense of, being alone.[CITATION-63] Whether the idea of a national \u2018alone\u2019 is to be found in other private sources from the war will require further research. If such evidence is found then this will be interesting, but it will not alter significantly the main contention of this article: that the national alone was not dominant, or even very visible at all, in the British public sphere during wartime. This is a conclusion which differs very substantially from the consensus of existing historiography.As is the case with \u2018alone\u2019, many historians have also stated that \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was a common wartime usage. Angus Calder claimed that from 1940 \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was a \u2018phrase which stuck\u2019; \u2018it became a clich\u00e9\u2019.[CITATION-64] For Paul Addison \u2018it was a new phrase on the lips of speakers\u2019 which encapsulated the leftward shift of 1940.[CITATION-65] Malcolm Smith gave it a Marxist origin, probably in the Spanish civil war, and suggested it was widely used by the end of 1940.[CITATION-66] However, looking at wartime sources suggests a different picture.and theeach used the term only about forty times in the entire war. By contrast \u2018total war\u2019 was used 536 times in. Google\u2019s Ngram shows a similar ratio: \u2018total war\u2019 is here ten times more prevalent than \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019.[CITATION-67] Furthermore it was not used in places where the argument about its prevalence and meaning in 1940 would suggest it should have been. It is not in, though \u2018total war\u2019 is.[CITATION-68] It is not in the Priestley, nor in his, though it would have been potentially useful for an argument about the importance of the idea of \u2018the people\u2019 as opposed to classes (divisive) or masses (a Nazi and Soviet concept) and for more democracy in Britain.[CITATION-69] It is not in Cassandra\u2019snor in Orwell\u2019sThe main usage of \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was as a synonym for \u2018total war\u2019, or mass war, which involved every part of the nation, echoing the early nineteenth-century German, theor national war. It was used in this sense during and about the First World War, and also of Franco\u2019s war in Spain, and by both the German and British propaganda ministers in the Second World War, Joseph Goebbels and Sir John Reith.[CITATION-70] Goebbels was quoted using the term by the.[CITATION-71] Churchill claimed in July 1940 that this was \u2018no war of chieftains or of princes, of dynasties or national ambition; it is a war of peoples and of causes\u2019.[CITATION-72] It was used in the sense of a nation in arms both in a government leaflet entitled \u2018People\u2019s War\u2019 calling for volunteers for the new Home Guard, and in a speech by the former Secretary of State for War, Leslie Hore-Belisha, in July 1940.[CITATION-73] It was often used in the sense that civilians were targets: indiscriminate bombing, noted, showed this was \u2018in the current phrase, a people\u2019s war\u2019.[CITATION-74] In April 1941 it was used in the sense that British people would fight on without leaders.[CITATION-75] Bevin used it in the sense of involving the people.[CITATION-76] In late 1941 it was used by both left and right to describe the special circumstances of the war raging in Russia.[CITATION-77] It was not primarily associated with the left.The left mainly used the term in an internationalist sense, to mean a war of the peoples of the world against fascism. Francis Williams\u2019sof 1940 noted that: \u2018This war must be a People\u2019s War and a People\u2019s War is only possible as an international war\u2019.[CITATION-78] Claiming this was not a generals\u2019 war, or a \u2018Public School war\u2019, he asserted that \u2018It is a People\u2019s War. It will be won when the People of Britain speak out to the People of Europe in their own voice and call them to a democratic revolution of the People against tyranny everywhere\u2019.[CITATION-79] Clement Attlee, reporting on an International Labour Organisation meeting in the USA in late 1941, noted \u2018this is a people\u2019s war \u2026 what is at stake is what kind of life shall be lived in future by the ordinary man and woman all over the world\u2019.[CITATION-80] Such internationalist usages were particularly evident in 1942. Lord Halifax, British ambassador to the USA, spoke in April 1942, in this sense, of a \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s victory\u2019.[CITATION-81] At a meeting of the International Labour Organisation in April 1942 to discuss post-war international reconstruction, Ernest Bevin declared, \u2018This is a people\u2019s, not a rich man\u2019s, war\u2019 and \u2018If this is a people\u2019s war there must be a people\u2019s peace\u2019.[CITATION-82] In 1944, British and Dominion Labour Parties issued a pamphlet concerned with international issues called.[CITATION-83] This usage makes perfect sense since internationalism, as is now being recognised, was a very important feature of wartime propaganda. From January 1942 there was much flying of the national flags of the \u2018United Nations\u2019, the signatories of the Atlantic Charter. There were ceremonies commemorating United Nations Day in 1942 and 1943 (which may well have overshadowed Empire Day). It was celebrated on the US Flag Day, 14 June.[CITATION-84] There was continued, perhaps increased, support for bodies such as Federal Union, an organisation which called for the union of European states, which included William Beveridge, a committed liberal internationalist.[CITATION-85] It is notable, but not usually noticed, that when broadcasting about his famous report at the end of 1942, he topped and tailed his talk by referring to the Atlantic Charter.[CITATION-86] Applied to the British case by the left, \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was a critical rather than a celebratory or descriptive concept. The general view of the left was that the United Kingdom, or the British Empire, wasactually fighting a \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019, butto be doing so. Tom Wintringham (who had fought in what he saw as a people\u2019s war in Spain) used the term in(1940), meaning a war waged by a \u2018people\u2019s army\u2019 rather than a totalitarian war.[CITATION-87] In his[], a Penguin Special published in 1942, he explicitly distinguished the (British) Imperial way of war from the Axis, or Blitzkrieg way, and also from what he called \u2018Peoples\u2019 War\u2019 [], which is what the Russians and the Chinese were engaged in. He proposed that Britain too should now fight such a war.[CITATION-88] A more general idea of \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 as something which ought to be pursued by the British was central to the programme of the Common Wealth Party of which Wintringham became a leading member. In its National Campaign in August 1942 it proclaimed: \u2018This War must be made a People\u2019s War\u2019.[CITATION-89] Flight Lieutenant Moeran, Common Wealth candidate at the Newark by-election in 1943, declared in his leaflet: \u2018A People\u2019s War: No more Darlans; closer co-operation with Russia; a total effort with ruthless cutting of hindrance by \u201cBig Business\u201d; immediate nationalisation of the mines \u2026\u2019 and a \u2018People\u2019s Peace: The Beveridge Report in full; Common Ownership of the great resources \u2026\u2019.[CITATION-90] Ritchie Calder used the term in a critical sense in 1941: he argued that frank discussion of the terrible failure to care for the victims of the Blitz was \u2018essential in a \u201cPeople\u2019s War\u201d \u2026 if we want a united nation, the Government must remove the suspicion \u2026 to many poor \u2026 a conviction, that the poor were being left to fend for themselves\u2019.[CITATION-91] The only wartime case I know of to use a positive application of the term to Britain was a 1945 election leaflet in which a communist candidate declared: \u2018It was a people\u2019s war. It has been a people\u2019s victory\u2019.[CITATION-92] Only later would it be generally rendered as a positive description of wartime Britain, especially and ironically in the hands of the historian of Common Wealth, and son of Ritchie, Angus Calder.[CITATION-93] The national \u2018alone\u2019, which barely existed as a concept or phrase in 1940, appeared in many guises from 1945 onwards. \u2018June 1940\u2014Britain stood alone\u2019 were the opening lines, with preceding images to match this national conception, of a post-V.E. Day film by Paul Rotha,. This illustrated the government publicationwhich, like the film, focused on the UK.[CITATION-94] George Orwell now claimed that in 1940 \u2018Britain was alone\u2019.[CITATION-95] Churchill, too, now espoused an explicit sense of a national \u2018alone\u2019. On V.E. Day, as well as giving the official account in which he spoke of how a united empire had fought on (as I noted above), he made a brief speech to the crowds in Whitehall, in which his invocation of \u2018alone\u2019 referred clearly to the \u2018British nation\u2019 and the \u2018ancient island\u2019, not the empire.[CITATION-96] This was also the story told in \u2018Mr Churchill\u2019s Declaration of Policy to the Electors\u2019, the 1945 Conservative Party election manifesto which, although much concerned with empire and imperial trade, used a national rather than an imperial \u2018we\u2019: \u2018During a whole year of this great war Britain bore the burden of the struggle alone\u2019, it noted, concluding that \u2018We shall never forget their love and steadfastness when we stood alone against the German Terror\u2019.[CITATION-97] Churchill\u2019s view was distinctive, for the imperial sense of \u2018alone\u2019 had certainly not disappeared, not least from the arguments of imperialists in 1945.[CITATION-98] In their manifesto, the Liberals celebrated the \u2018people of these Islands, the British Commonwealth and Empire\u2019 for collectively \u2018standing alone for a whole year against the insolent might of Germany and her allies\u2019.[CITATION-99] By contrast, the Labour manifesto, though full of references to \u2018the people\u2019 and \u2018the nation\u2019, had no \u2018alone\u2019 (only \u2018the spirit of Dunkirk and of the Blitz\u2019), no \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019, and no reference to \u2018empire\u2019 at all, and the barest mention of the Dominions, India and the \u2018Colonial Dependencies\u2019.[CITATION-100] Early histories of the war were divided on the matter of \u2018alone\u2019. The national \u2018alone\u2019 did appear in Churchill\u2019s semi-official history, which was published in six volumes between 1948 and 1953. The second volume,, had as the \u2018theme of the volume\u2019, inscribed at the front, \u2018How the British People held the fort ALONE TILL THOSE WHO HITHERTO HAD BEEN HALF BLIND WERE HALF READY\u2019, that is, without the United States. There is a certain ambiguity here about what was meant by \u2018the British People\u2019, but the second half of the volume (Book II) is entitled \u2018Alone\u2019, and in the opening sentences of a chapter called \u2018At Bay\u2019, Churchill says of 1940 that \u2018we were alone\u2019, adding that the empire was not in a position to help.[CITATION-101] A national \u2018alone\u2019 also figured in other books of the period. For example, the military historian Cyril Falls claimed that the United Kingdom had been alone, while Roy Harrod\u2019s biography of Maynard Keynes claimed it was Britain which stood alone.[CITATION-102] The fact that the first official civilian history, Keith Hancock and Margaret Gowing\u2019s, actively and comprehensively rejected any allegation that Britain fought \u2018alone\u2019 suggests that this idea was in play post-war:Even in the darkest months of 1940 and 1941, the United Kingdom did not fight alone. The resisting European Governments found sanctuary in Britain, small bands of fighting Frenchmen, Poles, Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians and Czechs took up battle stations with the British forces, while in their subdued homelands obstinate patriots tuned in to Big Ben and formed with each other those first conspiratorial groupings that grew later into the Resistance. Moreover, in the early winter of 1940, while Wavell\u2019s men were winning the first desert victories, the Greek state and people flung back Mussolini\u2019s attack. For the British people, these were great months\u2014fit climax to the Battle of Britain and fit reward for their civilian fortitude.[CITATION-103] The empire was not forgotten for, as they wrote, in \u2018this year of decision, Britain was not an isolated island, but the rallying-centre of Commonwealth and Empire. The reinforcement of her national power was both military and economic\u2019.[CITATION-104] Internationalism was central to their book, for they argued in effect that a Britain truly alone, one forced to become self-sufficient, would certainly \u2018neither have made effective war nor even maintained [its] civil population\u2019.[CITATION-105] Even in war Britain depended on an \u2018international economic order\u2019 in which it had a privileged place. Britain could import food rather than growing it, it could import oil rather than go to the costly trouble of making it from coal, and it could, if necessary, import manufactures, from tanks to tractors, on a vast scale.[CITATION-106] Historians writing over the following decade were closer in spirit to Hancock and Gowing than to Churchill. Deliciously, a 1950s edition of Henrietta Marshall\u2019s children\u2019s historyhas no reference to Britain being \u2018alone\u2019 in 1940, and said of 1939 that \u2018Britain was not alone; not only had Canada, New Zealand and the other British dominions declared war on Germany but so had Britain\u2019s old ally, France\u2019.[CITATION-107] Charles Mowat, although he used \u2018alone\u2019 as his final subheading in his history of Britain up to 1940, noted that \u2018there remained, alone, Britain and the Commonwealth, together with those patriots who had escaped\u2019 Nazi occupation. It was, however, a national moment, in which the British people \u2018found themselves again, after twenty years of indecision. They turned away from past regrets and faced the future unafraid\u2019.[CITATION-108] Note that \u2018again\u2019. Henry Pelling\u2019s(1960) had no \u2018alone\u2019 at all.[CITATION-109] How present any sense of a national \u2018alone\u2019 was in the popular culture of the immediate post-war period is a matter yet to be determined, but it is notable that the Battle of Britain film, the most popular movie of 1956, has Douglas Bader commanding a squadron composed largely of Canadians who are shown listening to part of Churchill\u2019s Finest Hour speech, including the reference to the \u2018British Empire and its Commonwealth\u2019. There is no \u2018alone\u2019 at all.[CITATION-110] From the late 1950s, the national \u2018alone\u2019 slowly became a commonplace. For example, John Wheeler-Bennett\u2019s 1958 biography of King George VI claimed something the late king-emperor could never have uttered in public: \u2018Britain now stood alone in the fight, stripped and girt for battle, and unimpeded by less determined friends\u2019.[CITATION-111] The 1958 filmin a voice-over near the end intoned: \u2018we were alone but undivided; no longer were there fighting men and civilians, there were only people; a nation had been made whole\u2019\u2014indeed the coming together of fighting men and civilians wastheme of the film (it was emphatically not about the coming together of classes).[CITATION-112] A.J.P. Taylor used \u2018alone\u2019 as a page heading in the chapter \u2018Finest Hour 1940\u20131941\u2019 of his(1965), yet noted that Britain gained many allies.[CITATION-113] Twice in the text he refers back to \u2018the period when Great Britain stood alone\u2019.[CITATION-114] Angus Calder, in his(1969), notes in inverted commas that Britain \u2018stood alone\u2019 and without commas that Britain fought alone.[CITATION-115] He criticised the notion of \u2018alone\u2019 for excluding millions of Asians, which was of course an important and correct point, but did not make it explicit that it excluded more than the Asian elements of empire.[CITATION-116] Paul Addison\u2019s(1975) has only a passing mention of the \u2018British left alone to await Hitler\u2019s onslaught\u2019.[CITATION-117] These instances occurred at a time when the use of the national \u2018alone\u2019 was proliferating.[CITATION-118] Thames Television\u2019s history of the Second World War,, entitled its fourth episode \u2018Alone\u2019, with a subtitle dating this from May 1940 to May 1941.[CITATION-119] In 1990, Kenneth Morgan was not unusual among professional historians in claiming of 1940 that \u2018Truly the nation was alone\u2019It was not lack of expertise in British history which led Simon Schama to tell the nation in 2009 that, in the year following 1940, \u2018The complete isolation of Britain, fighting on alone, which Hitler not unreasonably assumed would make it a soft target, had precisely the reverse effect. Churchill turned on the \u201cisland nation\u201d rhetoric and the British people across all classes, with very few exceptions, echoed him\u2019A minority of historians continued to see things differently. Some suggested that a national \u2018alone\u2019 was the product of wartime morale building.[CITATION-122] Others argued that Britain was not alone, noting the role of the Dominions and, more rarely, the governments in exile.[CITATION-123] Some noted that what was \u2018alone\u2019 was Britainthe Dominions, or the Commonwealth.[CITATION-124] A few noted that Britain was not alone as it was supported by the Dominionsthe United States.[CITATION-125] More unusual has been the argument that the whole empire, not just Britain and the Dominions, was alone.[CITATION-126] Avoiding the term and concept altogether became, and remains, very rare.[CITATION-127] Historians who noted that Britain not only had an empire (or was a central part of an empire), but also had allies, are rare exceptions.[CITATION-128] Why was it that an imperial and internationalist war was turned into a national one, with a focus on 1940? I suggest there was a general shift to a national conception of Britain after 1945, rather than after 1940.[CITATION-129] This was closely connected to changing economic relations with the USA, which in itself provided reasons for telling a story of a nation alone in 1940. In August 1945 the USA abruptly cut off that great symbol and agent of wartime internationalism, Lend-Lease, suddenly making the United Kingdom into an economy with a serious balance of payments problem. \u2018Alone\u2019 was a rebuke to, and a claim against, the USA. Central to the British argument was the idea that in 1940 and 1941 Britain fought thefight, without the United States (rather than, as in the usual framing, without France), whichin this view have been already engaged, not least financially, with the war effort.[CITATION-130] This \u2018alone\u2019 had to be national in conception both to elicit sympathy, to avoid reference to the empire (which was unpleasing to US opinion), and also, crucially, because the problem with external British finances was not the indebtedness of the empire as a whole, but rather British national indebtednessthe empire. In trade terms, too, it was the United Kingdom, not the empire, which was in significant deficit with the USA from 1945. The question of relations with the US also helps us understand why for some historians, in a similar manner to the suggestion made in Churchill\u2019s history, \u2018alone\u2019 meant \u2018without the USA\u2019. For Sidney Pollard \u2018Britain stood virtually alone\u2019 from the summer of 1940 to December 1941.[CITATION-131] A.J.P. Taylor also saw December 1941 ending the \u2018alone\u2019 period, on the basis that the Soviet War was a separate one.[CITATION-132] Arthur Bryant, who did not particularly emphasise \u2018alone\u2019, argued that \u2018the British people had to stand alone and fight their own battles\u2019 until \u2018the might of the United States came to be exerted in Europe\u2019\u2014meaning, one supposes, 1942, or perhaps later.[CITATION-133] Robert Holland makes what seems to me a key point about British self-representation: that \u2018what mattered almost as much as beating Hitler, was the company one kept in doing so\u2019.[CITATION-134] It is also notable that from 1944, and especially from 1945, and in contrast to 1918, the war was accounted for nationally. War statistics\u2014for example,(1944),(1945) and the(1951)\u2014were presented in national and not imperial terms, thus seriously misrepresenting not only the context but the very nature of British war production.[CITATION-135] Official civil and military histories of the war were written from the national point of view, and with a national focus, even though military operations and questions of supply had been both international and imperial.[CITATION-136] These official histories, it has been argued, profoundly shaped the works of historians of the 1960s and surely did so in this respect too.[CITATION-137] But there were many other reasons why a national focus became standard by the 1960s. After 1945, and increasingly so later, a British national identity became, in many different facets of life from the economy to the monarchy, much stronger, as an imperial identity receded.[CITATION-138] It is notable, for example, that the 1951 Festival of Britain was distinctly national in focus, in contrast to the great Empire exhibition of 1924 and the too often forgotten equivalent of 1938.[CITATION-139] By the 1960s, what was tellingly called \u2018immigration\u2019 from the empire and the Commonwealth, \u2018produced an Englishness that was increasingly defined in opposition to empire/Commonwealth\u2019.[CITATION-140] It was in this post-war national context that the idea of the nation \u2018alone\u2019 during war itself came to flourish. It was in the same context that \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 entered the historiography.The term \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was not used in histories before the 1960s, and it was very rarely taken up by historians before the early 1980s, only making a significant impact in the 1990s.[CITATION-141] For example, there is no \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 in Hancock and Gowing\u2019s, in Churchill\u2019s, Richard Titmuss\u2019sof 1950, or Pelling\u2019s[CITATION-142] The term was used, and defined by, three key histories of the war: A.J.P Taylor\u2019s, Angus Calder\u2019sand Paul Addison\u2019s. The first use, which set the new tone, seems to be in A.J.P. Taylor\u2019s, which ended with the resounding claim that in the war \u2018the British people came of age. This was a people\u2019s war \u2026 Imperial greatness was on the way out; the welfare state was on the way in\u2019.[CITATION-143] In Angus Calder\u2019sand Paul Addison\u2019sthe phrase was also used, though, as in Taylor, sparingly, but significantly. For Addison, 1940 was \u2018critical year\u2019 when \u2018all sections of the nation put aside their peacetime differences \u2026 the foundations of political power shifted decisively leftwards\u2019. The Labour Party went into government, the TUC became \u2018virtually a department of state\u2019, the official dissemination of \u2018social democratic ideas\u2019 began, and great importance was now attached to the morale and welfare of the workers\u2019\u2014all this was what was captured for Addison by the term \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019.[CITATION-144] All three works, and those that follow them, whether using the term \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 or not, are accounts of the war which focus on a progressive domestic Britain, and on the proto-welfare state.[CITATION-145] \u2018People\u2019s war\u2019 was in this account a progressive national war, driven by Labour and progressive ideas.[CITATION-146] \u2018People\u2019s war\u2019 was now used in different senses from wartime usages. It was a celebratory rather than a critical term, and was used descriptively of wartime Britain. Rather than being used in the wartime internationalist sense, it was now a national and nationalist notion. The unit of analysis was \u2018Britain\u2019 or something like it. The term implied a nation coming together, gaining strength by turning inward, mobilising national resources to transform the national economy. It played down not only empire but also the allies, the United Nations and the dependence of the wartime UK on a global order. Also in contrast to wartime usage, the military was sidelined, in what were essentially studies of civilians at war.[CITATION-147] These national histories were also histories from the centre-left, which told a story of a nation that began to transform itself through welfare and through the advance of the left, rather than the more politically neutral wartime sense of a \u2018people\u2019s\u2019 war as total war.These works, and of course others, enshrine 1940 as a key political moment, preparing for, and indeed overshadowing, the Labour landslide of 1945. This focus on 1940 as the key moment of political change has been and remains very potent. For example, Ross McKibbin\u2019s recent political history of the period identifies two key dates: 1931, which saw the establishment of Conservative hegemony, and 1940, its loss; 1945 merely confirms the new dispensation of 1940.[CITATION-148] The astonishing degree to which the war is still seen as the key radical moment can be seen on the website for Ken Loach\u2019s 2013 documentary,, which begins: \u2018The Second World War was a struggle, perhaps the most considerable collective struggle this country has ever experienced\u2019.[CITATION-149] Indeed, Calder\u2019s \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 carried within it a rebuke to what happened after 1945.[CITATION-150] Wrongly seen as a criticism of \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 accounts, it lamented the subversion of the great progressive project of wartime Britain by dark forces which took control and power over the Atlantic.[CITATION-151] Later, he would claim that the transfer, under the cover of myth, took place in 1940.[CITATION-152] Since the late 1980s, and especially from the 1990s, the term \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 in this new sense has spread far and wide. It was used as the title for the Channel Four TV seriesof 1985.[CITATION-153] The term was also used for a vast collection of Second World War memories collected by the BBC between 2003 and 2006.[CITATION-154] It began to be used in titles of books and papers, its meaning taken to be familiar.[CITATION-155] The term began to pepper histories of the war. For example, it is used repeatedly, with no explanation, in Weight\u2019s.[CITATION-156] Geoffrey Field\u2019s 2011 book on the British working class in the Second World War repeatedly invokes \u2018\u201cPeople\u2019s War\u201d\u2019, capitalised and in quotation marks, as a central wartime concept requiring no explanation.[CITATION-157] Many cultural histories of the Second World War, have taken the notion of \u2018the people\u2019s war\u2019 to describe a wartime ideology, often assuming it to be a wartime coining, closely associated with both the left and the nation.Before the 1980s, only a few scholars of the New Left wrote explicitly and with broad approval of the Second World War as a national and nationalist moment.[CITATION-158] But later some on the left sought to create a new usable nationalism by examining that of the war, and assuming that this was a nationalism which needed remaking.[CITATION-159] Some suggested that Labour won in 1945 because of its embrace of nationalism.[CITATION-160] More broadly, the idea of a new wartime nationalism which ought not to be emulated became a common assumption in the literature which emerged from the late 1980s about \u2018national identity\u2019.[CITATION-161] A key figure here was Raphael Samuel. An extreme example of his thinking comes in a passage from in a draft paper written in 1995, which was subsequently published posthumously:\u2026 the patriotic hour of May\u2013June 1940, possibly on the account of the splendid isolation in which, by force of necessity, this country found itself, possibly because of the ethnocentric panic which swept the country in the wake of Dunkirk (in the face of the imminent threat of invasion, aliens of all kinds, even Jews, were interned), \u2018English\u2019 was the favoured idiom in which the idea of nation was couched \u2026 It was in the name of England that, in May 1940, enraged conservative backbenchers brought the Chamberlain government to its knees; the \u2018island race\u2019 of Churchill\u2019s apostrophes was English rather than British; and when he turned to international outreach, it was in the first place to those he termed the \u2018English-speaking peoples of the world\u2019.[CITATION-162] This is an astonishingly misguided view. The period May\u2013June 1940 was not one of isolation\u2014the fall of France did not come until the end of June; the idea of an ethnocentric panic in the wake of Dunkirk ignores (among many other things) the warm reception given to evacuated French troops; only-alien(whether Jews or not) were interned; it was not in the name of England that Chamberlain was brought down by the Tories: \u2018In the name of God, go\u2019 was the famous line from Leo Amery. Churchill did not, in 1940, speak for England but for the British Empire, and he reached out to France and many other non-English speaking peoples, not least those subjugated by Hitler.While views such as Samuel\u2019s were commonplace in some quarters, the more usual argument developed in the 1980s and \u201990s was rather different. According to this view, it was the British people who felt they were a nation alone in the 1940s. The new ideology of this nation was a national \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019. There was a new \u2018social patriotism\u2019 exemplified particularly by the work of Orwell and Priestley, while the notion of a \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 expressed working-class radicalisation and \u2018patriotic mobilization\u2019.[CITATION-163] This interpretation held that \u2018the prevailing image of the war for Britain was national, indeed insular\u2019; there was a \u2018sense of inward retreat\u2019.[CITATION-164] Richard Weight wrote of the \u2018legend\u2019 of the Finest Hour, where \u2018the British\u2014standing alone and defiant on their island home\u2014saved the world from tyranny\u2019, but argued this belief was central to a new post-imperial identity constructed in 1940.[CITATION-165] Similarly, for Robert Colls \u2018the British stood alone\u2019 between June 1940 and June 1941, a period which he identified as \u2018a moment of high national identification\u2019; he invoked the \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 as well.[CITATION-166] R.M. Douglas argued that the Labour Party shifted decisively from internationalism to nationalism during the war.[CITATION-167] Andrew Marr saw the years 1939\u201342 as crucial years of defeat which transformed Britain, when the \u2018besieged\u2019 British \u2018found themselves knitted together in a new national comradeship \u2026 It was the real end of Britannia, the imperial, now befuddled conqueror island, and the real beginning of modern Britain\u2019.[CITATION-168] It was a \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019.[CITATION-169] That historians identified the \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 with the nation is clear in Krishan Kumar\u2019s.[CITATION-170] Wendy Webster took \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 to be a wartime phrase used to refer to the British people, and thus coined the term \u2018people\u2019s empire\u2019 to distinguish the imperial variant she found.[CITATION-171] Paul Ward, in his, connected \u2018Patriotism and politics in the people\u2019s war\u2019 and argued that the emergent wartime welfare state was national-patriotic and racially homogeneous, claiming it was only very much later that what stood alone was empire, a venture which involved non-whites too.[CITATION-172] A more recent example is to be found in Stuart Hall\u2019s memoir. In his view, while the war was really an imperial war, won in the end by the USA, the USSR and the British Empire, it was, at the time, presented as a national one, obscuring its imperial nature: \u2018up to a point, the heightened self-consciousness of national unity \u2026 ideologically cemented the British nation. This was the effect of confronting the spectacle of possible defeat \u2026 Churchill\u2019s political rhetoric \u2026 crystallized a national climacteric, responding to the historical realities of a nation a hair\u2019s breadth from destruction\u2019.[CITATION-173] The \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was both real and ideological: \u2018The war is still primarily remembered as the achievement of the common people all mucking in together, the people\u2019s war, the home front, the egalitarian experiences of the Blitz \u2026 the war remains the resonant dividing line, the hiatus, between then and now \u2026 rivetted in the historical memory\u2019. He went on: \u2018the national history may be untrue \u2026 [but] it does have the merit of articulating the shift in social power \u2026 The war was, after all, the principal factor in the social-democratic remaking of the nation\u2019.[CITATION-174] The belief that during the war people believed in \u2018alone\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was strengthened by other accounts which aimed at debunking wartime myths. In 1991 Angus Calder published, a pioneering cultural history of the war and the first sustained denunciation of the myths of 1940.[CITATION-175] It was notable for going back to wartime sources. Yet both \u2018alone\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 were still very present in his argument: \u2018Alone\u2019 is included in one chapter heading, even though he stressed that the empire was important, and that foreigners flew in the battle of Britain (a somewhat limited recognition of the importance of the outside world). He included as an index entry \u2018People\u2019s war, myth of\u2019, with eleven pages cited.[CITATION-176] Neither term (excepting one lone reference to \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019) derived from his extensive quotations from primary sources.[CITATION-177] Calder did not acknowledge his own pivotal role in creating an understanding of the war which now he criticised.By the late 1990s, the concept of \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was being projected back on to the 1940s as a central wartime ideology. James Chapman in his study of wartime film, claimed that the \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 was both part of the myth and the reality of the war; that it was the most important element in film propaganda, that it focused on ordinary men and women, national unity and social cohesion, where class difference was replaced by a democratic sense of community and comradeship.[CITATION-178] His is one of many studies which have taken wartime film as central examples of what they see as new national \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 ideology of cross-class unity. Yet Ross McKibbin, in my view correctly, has seen little ideological change in film from the 1930s to the late 1940s and notes of the relevant films that they generally do not espouse a left patriotism.[CITATION-179] , Noel Coward\u2019s 1942 hagiography of Lord Mountbatten, is one apposite example. One can go further: some films that have been claimed as \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 films have distinctively right-wing themes:(1942) and(1942) both whitewash pre-war pro-fascists.[CITATION-180] (1943) is interesting for its overt portrayal of class tension rather than cohesion, its airing of a left critique of Britain and for the emphasis it places on bridging the gap between the factory and the forces (a wartime \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 theme).[CITATION-181] (1946) is notable not for it its national \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 focus, but because it is pro-American and internationalist.[CITATION-182] The idea of \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 as central to wartime ideology became pivotal to many histories critical of wartime society. Thus Lucy Noakes took it as a powerful necessary wartime ideology, which has persisted as a powerful image of the war.[CITATION-183] Similarly\u2014although she has brought rich new wartime evidence to light in\u2014Sonya Rose has ended up strengthening the view that the war was believed to be a \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019. She has also challenged what she has taken to be perceptions of the \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019, but continued to put the concept at the centre of wartime ideas, taking it for granted that the war was and is usually so labelled.[CITATION-184] She asserts that \u2018It was in the immediate post-Dunkirk period and the beginnings of the Blitz that the depiction of the war as a \u2018People\u2019s War\u2019 took hold in the public imagination\u2019; \u2018The People\u2019s War\u2019 was \u2018a construction promulgated by the press, radio, and film, one that profoundly shaped and was elaborated in both official and unofficial wartime propaganda\u2019.[CITATION-185] For Rose, this was a left view, focused on the rebuilding of a new Britain: \u2018there was a left-leaning, populist, progressive shift in the dominant political culture that inundated the United Kingdom \u2026 The idea that a new Britain would rise like a phoenix from the ashes of war was a powerful one that dominated the hopes and fears articulated in popular discourse\u2019.[CITATION-186] The difficulty is that this was not a \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 idea from wartime itself, but rather, as in the other cases above, the imposition onto the war of a 1960s and 1970s national, welfarist and left conception of the war as \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019. Over a number of decades a particular Taylor-Calder-Addison thesis has been turned into a wartime historical reality, which is itself open to criticism, rather than being understood as a later thesis about the war.The problem of failing to see past the concepts of the 1960s and 1970s is very evident in the argument that the new left nationalism of 1940 was expressed through the contemporary writings of J.B. Priestley and George Orwell.[CITATION-187] The work of Priestley and Orwell is taken for celebratory left nationalism, rather than being representative of a celebratory liberal imperialism on the one hand, and a critical call for a true national anti-imperialist people\u2019s war on the other. These readings are often the only evidence for 1940 left nationalism, apart from invocations of \u2018alone\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019.[CITATION-188] Although historians now doubt Priestley\u2019s left credentials, they note only his supposed nationalism, ignoring the very evident imperialism.[CITATION-189] Orwell\u2019s positions are also routinely misrepresented. Orwell, who was clearly an anti-imperialist, did not, as is claimed or implied, suggest a new popular association between patriotism and socialism in 1940. In, written in 1944, Orwell argued that \u2018During the bad period of 1940 it became clear that in Britain national solidarity is stronger than class antagonism \u2026 It was exactly then that class feeling slipped into the background, only reappearing when the immediate danger had passed\u2019.[CITATION-190] Indeed Orwell\u2019s works of 1940/41 had made this very point.argues for theof British patriotism among the left (his well-known charge), but, crucially, that after Dunkirktypes of patriotism were very obvious, and were not a new kind.[CITATION-191] For Orwell, 1940 brought out the \u2018integrity of British national feeling\u2019, \u2018the revelation of working-class patriotism\u2019 as expressed in mobilisation into the Home Guard, but not apatriotism.[CITATION-192] Orwell\u2019s point was that the leftto take advantage; the potential revolutionary patriotic feeling of 1940and \u2018in general we are still commanded by people\u2019, he later complained, who lived through the 1930s \u2018without ever discovering that Hitler was dangerous\u2019.[CITATION-193] Orwell himself developed what he saw as a missing left-nationalist critique, not celebration, of wartime Britain, including criticism of the Labour Party.attacked English capitalism, imperialism and the war effort from that perspective.[CITATION-194] He was not alone in this sort of critique: Cassandra\u2019slambasted the officer class of the army as old, class-prejudiced amateurs, and complained that everything continued to be run in the same way as before the war, but with higher profits and dividends.[CITATION-195] This critical nationalist position was also central to the Communist Party position from 1941: it saw British weakness as the result of the economic internationalism of the British ruling class.[CITATION-196] Why has this more recent account of the national \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 come to be seen as a wartime creation? Why is it been taken as so self-evidently correct that it has strongly affected the reading of primary sources, including the work of Priestley and Orwell? More specifically, why was it that cultural histories from the 1990s identified that ideological work being done in the Second World War itself, rather than in the key histories whose theses they echoed? The most important reason is a failure to detect a nationalism of the left in the work of key post-war historians\u2014indeed, a failure to see left British nationalism as anything other than a temporary wartime phenomenon. For the post-war years, only Irish, Welsh and Scottish nationalism are evident to many historians. Scottish nationalism can be accepted in the context of new nationalisms across the former British world, and be of the left, whereas British nationalism cannot.[CITATION-197] While it is possible to find left-Australian histories of the 1970s producing national-creation stories around ANZAC and the fall of Singapore, thereby projecting the nation back into an imperial era, British historians doing much the same thing have not been discerned so easily. British nationalism, to the extent it exists at all, is seen as an ideology of the right, and closely allied to imperialism, making a British anti-imperialist nationalism of the left doubly implausible.[CITATION-198] Indeed, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s nationalism/imperialism and its electoral success were a vital spur to the study of \u2018national identity\u2019.[CITATION-199] This was the context for many studies in which \u2018national identity\u2019 became the topic, the title or the sub-title of many books, not least on the Second World War. This literature did not, with few exceptions, identify any form of imperial identity, only a national one which might express itself in imperialist terms.[CITATION-200] In fact, a left nationalism, anti-imperialism and hostility to cosmopolitan capitalism (often itself conflated with imperialism) was common on the intellectual left. Recognition of the existence of this left nationalism has, however, been very fragmentary. Tom Nairn has pointed to the nationalism of Labour, showing how it celebrated national not class victories.[CITATION-201] It is telling that E.P. Thompson is sometimes thought to be a uniquely nationalist left intellectual.[CITATION-202] This is taken to be so unusual as to require explanation. Priya Satia has suggested it came from his exposure to Indian nationalism.[CITATION-203] There is, however, a much more straightforward explanation. The Communist Party, during the war, adopted a strongly nationalist critique of British imperialism and liberalism, and that nationalist critique intensified after the war, as can be seen in the party programme of 1951, the.[CITATION-204] Eric Hobsbawm\u2019sprovides a clear example of such a critique, one which celebrates the national moment of the Second World War as industrially transformative, as the exception which proved the rule.[CITATION-205] It was also a pioneering declinist text, and indeed declinism, a central feature of intellectual discourse from the 1950s into the 1990s, mostly from the centre-left, was typically nationalist (and anti-imperialist) also.[CITATION-206] This intellectual left nationalism was important for the writing of the social and political histories of the Second World War, many of which might be characterised as national popular front histories.[CITATION-207] It should not surprise us that historians of the left and centre-left in the 1960s and 1970s should have radically played down the imperialism or the internationalism of the British at war, nor that they should have overstressed the role of the left and the rise of welfare. But they did more than that. The pioneering social histories of war saw modern war as a civilian war, in which women and children played new roles. In these histories, the military were written out, and so were conservative forces, except as residua. These histories, based on particular assumptions about the nature of modernity and its progressive forces, had trouble grasping the specificity and significance of the military, even in war.[CITATION-208] The importance of centre and left national historical accounts of the British Second World War is made clearer if we note the surprising lack of national histories of the war from the right. Churchill\u2019s multi-volume semi-official history was of the war as a whole, with a notable emphasis on the USA, rather than the story of the British national or imperial war. In this he was followed by many historians of the right.[CITATION-209] Indeed, the historiographical right has had a complex relationship with national wartime history. An imperialist critique of the war as unnecessary has been presented in rather oblique terms and not cast as a general history of Britain at war, or indeed of the empire at war.[CITATION-210] A significant and revealing exception is the work of the nationalist and anti-imperialist Correlli Barnett, for whom the empire was alone but also weak. Barnett argued that wartime Britain did not mobilise nationally but became dependent on the USA; its internationalism and imperialism (as well as welfare) undermined the possibility of national reconstruction in war as in peace.[CITATION-211] This was an inversion of the left-national story, not an alternative to it, and has usually been seen only as a critique of the welfare state. But we need to know very much more about how Conservatives understood the war, both during it and afterwards.[CITATION-212] There was more variety, not least in private understandings, than the focus here on history books reveals.It is a tribute to the power of the historians who created the new post-war national histories, especially of the war, that their work should be so easily conflated with what happened, such that their assumptions dominate textbooks and curricula to this day. They were crucial in creating the national identity which historians writing at a later date would find ever deeper in the past. A less positive way of making the point is that there has been a notable reluctance to note the existence of different substantive traditions of interpretation in the writing of twentieth-century British history. They are rarely if ever discussed in surveys of the field.[CITATION-213] Indeed, recent reflections specifically lament the lack of synthetic interpretative works, and it has been implied that the only syntheses available, at least until recently, have been bad popular histories.[CITATION-214] One consequence of the failure to engage with historiography is that some cultural history of twentieth-century Britain has, far from challenging these assumptions, reinforced their significance by continuing to write within the same framework, even when claiming to do otherwise. To put it another way\u2014there is very much more to be challenged in the older histories than is currently commonly understood.However, change is afoot. British political history before 1939 has partially shaken off the influence of Churchill\u2019s account and the various ways it was adopted and adapted by Labour.[CITATION-215] The British Second World War is now seen as imperial and international.[CITATION-216] 1940/1941 has been understood not as a moment of weakness, but rather as the last moment when, relatively speaking, the British Empire was indeed a Great Power; the great defeats came in 1941/1942.[CITATION-217] The domestic political, economic and social history of the war has now moved on from the assumptions of the old national histories. New studies explore the significance of conservatism, the military and the warfare state, and the critics of the war.[CITATION-218] Much remains to be researched about elite and popular ideology, including how 1940 was understood (and I would still argue that it was an important moment).[CITATION-219] And there is much more to learn about how the war (and not just 1940) has been remembered. In broader British histories, too, there is a distinct sense that the broad arguments and assumptions which frame the historiography of twentieth-century Britain need dismantling. It is a task which is now underway on many fronts, including enquiry into historiographical keywords. It is not only \u2018alone\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 which should be used with caution and with an appreciation of their own historical trajectories and usage, but other such staples as \u2018affluence\u2019, \u2018social democracy\u2019, \u2018welfare state\u2019, \u2018consensus\u2019, \u2018neo-liberalism\u2019, \u2018post-war settlement\u2019 and more.[CITATION-220] Refreshing the historiography of twentieth-century Britain requires, more than we realise, an understanding of the usually hidden theoretical armature which structures it.",

Indeed, it is important to recognise, though much more research in needed on this, the extent to which 1940 resulted in celebration of the empire and nation and its achievements rather than criticism. There was celebration not simply of British tradition, but of pre-war developments in welfare, for example in pensions, unemployment benefit, health insurance, the abolition of poverty, legal aid, and noting indeed that \u2018We have not been too busy even to give our Empire away \u2026 for we have surrendered all rights in our vast Dominions\u2019: Mee, Nineteen-Forty, pp. 176\u20139.",

        "200": "For example, Linda Colley does not really address the issue of empire in her original text of Britons: Forging the Nation, 1707\u20131837 (1992; rev. edn, London, 2014) but did so in the preface to the new edition. Here she insists on the British Empire being seen as a British rather than an English enterprise (p. xxiv). Imperialism and Britishness were connected such that Britishness lost its strength as imperialism retreated, allowing a re-emergence of English, Scottish and Welsh identities which Britishness had downgraded. See also her Acts of Union and Disunion (London, 2014). D. McCrone, \u2018Unmasking Britannia: The Rise and Fall of British National Identity\u2019, Nations and Nationalism, iii (1997), pp. 579\u201396, following Colley, sees British identity as supra-national and existing above English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish national identities. Again, empire intrudes only slightly into this story, and does not really affect it. The focus on \u2018national identity\u2019 in many literatures is all the more surprising given the importance of the claim that the British people were very conscious of empire, though this claim has been disputed, notably by B. Porter, The Absent-Minded Imperialists: Empire, Society, and Culture in Britain (Oxford, 2004). Where imperialism is recognised as very important, it is seen as a key element of British national identity and indeed nationalism. For a different view, see Williamson, Stanley Baldwin; Webster, Englishness and Empire; ead., \u2018\u201cEurope against the Germans\u201d\u2019; and ead., Mixing It; and, especially, Edgerton, Rise and Fall of the British Nation, which argues for a strong British national identity as a post-imperial phenomenon. See also G. Evans, \u2018Irish Officers in the British and Indian Armies and Imperial Identity, c.1900\u20131945\u2019 (King\u2019s College London Ph.D. thesis, forthcoming 2021).

The tensions between nationalism and imperialism and their historiographical import is clear in J. Bjork, \u2018Flexible Fatherlands: \u201cPatriotism\u201d among Polish-speaking German Citizens during World War I\u2019, Central European History, liii (2020), pp. 71\u201393.",
        "201": "Nairn, Left against Europe?, is a remarkable critique of Labour which noted how both the Labour left and right put nation before class. Nairn sees the war as a triumph of working-class (but not Labour) mobilisation, and also a conservative one; Labour reaped what it had not sowed. In 1945 it enacted a liberal welfare state much as the Liberals would have done. This ignores other possible readings of the war and also that after 1945 there was a distinctly national political economy in play, which was not the case before 1914.",
