    "article": "This article focuses on the social and intellectual world of Francis Foster Barham (1808\u20131871) from the late 1830s to the mid-1850s. Barham was a prolific polymathic writer and lecturer whose oeuvre ranged from the classics to theology to esotericism, contemporary drama and literature. Based on wide reading and his interactions with fellow transcendentalists and idealists, he elaborated his own philosophy, \u2018syncretism\u2019, a universalising system of thought with applications to political, religious and social reform. This article uses the example of Barham, his philosophical speculations, and the small groups with which he was affiliated in London and the West Country, to illuminate the trajectory of a humanistic discourse\u2014in this case speculative metaphysical philosophy\u2014in the life of relatively obscure people who, outside of academic and scholarly circles, interpreted \u2018high\u2019 ideas in their own way. The article suggests that there is much more to be done to understand fully the cultural and intellectual history of the humanities in modern Britain, especially in the thought and experience of lesser-known people and associations. Recovering the history of ideas through such figures, their networks, and their own terminologies can point the way to fresh understandings of the history, nature and processes of intellectual development, including its \u2018freaks\u2019 and dead-ends, as well as its manifestation in and as culture.At the start of his essay, E.P. Thompson pronounced that \u2018To any rational mind, the greater part of the history of ideas is a history of freaks\u2019.[CITATION-1] Thompson meant this contemptuously, as a barb aimed at the object of his immediate derision, the \u2018freak\u2019 of Louis Althusser\u2019s aberrant Marxism. Thompson was suggesting that historians and other scholars tread a fine line in allowing fancies and caprices into their midst; these, if tolerated, can metastasise and threaten reason itself\u2014as he claimed Althusser\u2019s Marxism did. But what is less clear is whether Thompson was suggesting that historians do or ought to take such freaks seriously as objects of historical study. After all, one could be forgiven for thinking that the history of ideas, if we use the phrase interchangeably with intellectual history, is anything but the history of freaks: that it is not overly concerned with avenues glimpsed by a few but left untravelled, or with the misunderstandings of \u2018high\u2019 ideas by \u2018irrational\u2019 minds. In short, intellectual historians do not deal with what the biographer of the famed anthropologist J.G. Frazer memorably called \u2018the epistemology of misconception\u2019.[CITATION-2] What follows will focus on the life of one such \u2018freak\u2019, the polymathic writer and scholar Francis Foster Barham (1807\u201371), and the small circle of associates he interacted with from about 1838 to the mid-1850s. Barham sought to elucidate various forms of idealism and transcendentalism\u2014ideas discussed in greater detail below\u2014and to put his philosophical views into practice through his participation in small groups and networks. In other words, he sought to give essentially non-materialist metaphysical philosophies a practical application in the realm of experience, most notably through his political idea of \u2018syncretism\u2019 and its theological analogue, \u2018Alism\u2019.This article examines the ways Barham interpreted, synthesised and made use of speculative philosophy for his own purposes. This will be, unavoidably, a history of a freak with no natural offspring in the formal disciplines of philosophy, literature or any other science, broadly understood. Nevertheless, I want to suggest that Barham\u2019s case can demonstrate three closely entwined points. The first of these points is that the history of ideas and culture can be enriched if we are attentive to speculative discourses on the margins of the accepted, and, throughout the nineteenth century, increasingly specialised philosophical, cultural or historical thinking being done in more authoritative or canonical circles. This means that, outwith the trajectories of nineteenth-century disciplines, there were parallel discourses that drew on much of the same raw material, but with different outcomes.[CITATION-3] These, although they did not persist in academic disciplines or university departments, should nevertheless be a part of intellectual histories, very broadly understood.[CITATION-4] The second point is that \u2018high\u2019 ideas discussed in the learned environments that would become part of authoritative disciplines and higher education institutions had a rich and varied role in public discourse far beyond those settings.[CITATION-5] Francis Barham\u2019s understanding of speculative metaphysical philosophy was largely gleaned through his own reading and conversation; the same was true of most of his immediate associates, many of whom were instrumental in translating \u2018high\u2019 philosophy for a wider public audience.[CITATION-6] Speculative metaphysics of the kind embraced by Barham struggled to survive the transition in the later nineteenth and twentieth centuries to disciplinary philosophy in university departments, much\u2014though not all\u2014of which was realist in nature.[CITATION-7] But, as rationalism, and to an extent materialism, becamefor disciplinary legitimacy in philosophy, speculative discourses could (and did, and do) persist in less formal ways.My third point, then, is about culture: what the idea meant in Barham\u2019s circle, and how we might use Barham and his relationships as a starting point for a fresh examination of culture as a social phenomenon. Francis Barham was a post-romantic idealist heavily influenced by the works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, by the French eclectics, Reformation-era theologians, and by his immediate circle of idealist and transcendentalist friends and associates. In small archival traces, they left behind\u2014figurative speaking\u2014snippets of conversation about the significance of speculative philosophy, particularly idealist metaphysics, in contemporary discourses of social and cultural reform, long before the activities of T.H. Green and the later liberal reformers. Barham\u2019s theories about cultural improvement, and his attempts to achieve it in practice, are revealing of his and others\u2019 definition of culture as metaphysical in nature. As we will see, for Barham, literature was a\u2014perhaps\u2014fundamental constituent of culture as a transcendental category, and thus the creation and discussion of literature was a form of practical metaphysics.Overly deterministic disciplinary terminology can be problematic, especially in a case such as Barham\u2019s: metaphysical philosophy is, by its nature, about everything.[CITATION-8] But however else one might categorise him, Barham was most definitely a humanistic, cultural thinker, someone who pondered questions of human nature and relations, of philosophy, literature and life\u2019s purpose. Thus, his example sheds light on the story of cultural development beyond, but not wholly separate from, the evolution of humanities disciplines, eventually consolidated in the institutional contexts of universities and, at the start of the twentieth century, in the British Academy.[CITATION-9] Of course, this kind of in-depth study of an individual\u2019s thought is nothing new. But in synthesising Barham\u2019s story with aspects of older and newer historiographies (particularly insights from the history of science and twentieth-century philosophy of culture) I hope to suggest that the history of culture can be closely associated to the history of nineteenth-century humanities discourse.[CITATION-10] As Suzanne Marchand has persuasively argued, historians of the humanistic disciplines in the nineteenth century have been hampered by the Foucauldian power-knowledge paradigm, which ties up much of the Victorian organisation of knowledge with imperialist discourses.[CITATION-11] Examining the public, cultural or informal ways in which the ideas and practices of the humanities and social sciences were tested and performed outside of institutional settings presents one way of understanding how discourses of knowledge and ideas, such as speculative philosophy, can be understood beyond structuralist or Foucauldian paradigms.The approach outlined here also runs counter to some more recent fashionable trends in the history of ideas, knowledge and culture: namely, the turn to digital approaches that foreground large-scale quantitative analyses of digital corpora. Of course, most historians today understand and accept the need for combining digital methods with conventional ones; it is particularly important that historians of ideas and culture keep this balance in mind. As things stand, the impress of the digital turn is felt most strongly in literary criticism, cultural studies and political history, all of which have long emphasised the importance of language.[CITATION-12] But this also means that the turn to data mining and corpus analyses has the potential to transform the history of ideas and concepts in such a way as to place an ever wider gap between words and the individual people who wrote, heard, and read them.[CITATION-13] Perhaps the most striking example of the transformative potential of these digital methods is Franco Moretti\u2019s work, at the interface of literary criticism and history. Moretti\u2019s concept of \u2018distant reading\u2019 applies computational methods to digital corpora of vast numbers of novels\u2014the \u2018great unread\u2019\u2014without actually having to read them.[CITATION-14] Meanwhile, one of the pioneers of the digital history of political ideas in Britain, Peter de Bolla, has suggested that the digital turn puts scholars in a position to understand \u2018culture\u2019s thinking\u2019 by \u2018recreat[ing] the cultural terrain that provided historical actors with a conceptual lexicon for playing out their roles, making sense of their worlds and to each other\u2019.[CITATION-15] This digitally enabled recovery of concepts will entail an inevitable \u2018slackening of attention directed at human agents in the past\u2019.[CITATION-16] The digital turn marks a new chapter in the linguistic turn, but, like its twentieth-century predecessor, it could usefully be put into conversation with earlier, but still potentially transformative, understandings of culture, such as that put forward in the work of Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945). Cassirer described culture as a \u2018common world in which each individual consciousness participates and which it has to reconstruct in its own way and by its own efforts\u2019.[CITATION-17] As Cassirer saw it, culture is a shared creation\u2014something common, some might even call it totalising, but never monolithic, precisely because each and every mind is a part of it, while being simultaneously whole in itself.[CITATION-18] The complexity of culture is mirrored by the complexity of human minds and experiences, and it is by understanding the latter that we can begin to understand the former. Cassirer defined humans, not as, but asbeings defined not by their reason, but by their ability to represent the world of the subjective mind in communicable, symbolic forms.[CITATION-19] Cassirer\u2019s philosophy of culture has, perhaps, not been given the attention it deserves\u2014certainly not by historians. The dominance of post-structuralist approaches to cultural analysis has left little space for alternatives.[CITATION-20] However, although one can only conjecture at this stage, it should be possible to treat culture as a series of multi-vocal conversations, debates, consensuses, continuities and shifts; as the activities and experiences of individuals who have left behind communicable material evidence, which can be recovered through historical methods. To paraphrase George Eliot, there remain vast fields of \u2018unvisited tombs\u2019, whose occupants were once a part of culture\u2019s thinking, in small or large ways.[CITATION-21] This article attempts, on a small scale, to reconstruct one man\u2019s intellectual experiences, and to suggest that if we are to understand fully the history of ideas and culture in modern Britain, particularly its humanities, we must think with real human agents: the individuals and small groups that make \u2018big data\u2019 speak, to adapt a well-worn phrase from archaeology.[CITATION-22] The article proceeds first with an examination of Francis Barham\u2019s early life and education, along with his family background, including its religious and social concerns. Section II provides an in-depth consideration of the intellectual currents that circulated in the 1830s, when Barham became active in literary pursuits, particularly of the relations between idealism and its more \u2018popular\u2019 iteration, transcendentalism. This section will also introduce Barham\u2019s close associate and early mentor, James Pierrepont Greaves, and examine Barham\u2019s experience in Greaves\u2019s Aesthetic Institute. Drawing an analogy with the history of science, and thinking with the epistemology of romantic aesthetics, I will make the case, somewhat speculatively, that the Aesthetic Institute was a site for the conscious \u2018practice\u2019 of culture. The following section will provide detailed discussion of Barham\u2019s own philosophy, which he called \u2018syncretism\u2019, and its theological equivalent, \u2018Alism\u2019. During his syncretic phase, Barham was a founding member of his own group, the Syncretic Society, whose activities in organisation, publishing, and advocacy will also be considered. Section IV will describe Barham\u2019s later life in Bristol and Bath, and examine how he used his ideas to re-establish a humanistic circle within the Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution. The concluding section provides reflection on the points raised throughout the article, as well as speculation on the potential for a future history of the humanities as the history of ideasandculture.To say that Francis Barham was a prolific writer would be an understatement: when he died, he left behind manuscript materials weighing 116 pounds.[CITATION-23] While the majority of this has been lost, Barham published quite a lot in his lifetime, and his executor, the printer, publisher and linguistic progressive Isaac Pitman, whom Barham had met during his later years in Bath, edited and published a selection\u2014amounting to a mere seven pounds in weight\u2014of the remaining material in a posthumous collection.[CITATION-24] This extant work makes piecing together the chronology of Barham\u2019s life fairly straightforward, though it is sometimes difficult to tease out reality from fantasy. And Barham was, in part, a fantasist: some of his posthumous writings, though presented as wholly autobiographical, are essentially mythologised versions of his early life. His accounts are hard to verify because much of what he left behind has gone. There are no personal letters and vanishingly little correspondence; only a curious array of scholarly outputs, metaphysical and theological reflection, and flights of fancy\u2014sometimes all in the same document.Barham was born in west Cornwall, not far from the port town of Penzance, where his parents had moved due to the fragile health of his father, the composer and musician Thomas Foster Barham (1766\u20131844).[CITATION-25] If Francis\u2019s later writing is to be believed, his formative years were spent gazing out on stormy seas, trekking the cliffs of Penwith, and tramping around the scrublands of the somewhat more distant Lizard Peninsula. After being educated at home by his deeply religious, if rather unconventional, mother, Mary Ann, herself the daughter of a clergyman, Francis was sent to school in Essex. There he was taught by one of his older brothers\u2014Francis was the youngest of five sons\u2014before eventually taking to law as his profession. He never attended university. On the face of it, this appears strange: the Barham family was well educated in the conventional sense and possibly well monied, too. Francis\u2019s father, Thomas Sr, was a younger son, but the older brother Joseph Barham, Francis\u2019s uncle, owned sugar plantations in Jamaica and was very well off.[CITATION-26] Thomas Sr had been to Cambridge, as had all of Francis\u2019s brothers.[CITATION-27] Charles Barham, four years older than Francis, went on to become a highly successful doctor in Truro, Cornwall, and an active member of Truro\u2019s Royal Cornwall Institute. Thomas Jr, who was Francis\u2019s elder by fourteen years, was also a physician before he retired early and threw himself into classical scholarship, along with questions of social reform; he flirted with aspects of Fourierism.[CITATION-28] That Francis did not follow his brothers to Cambridge is probably explained by the fact that, according to his own account, he suffered from periods of ill health throughout his youth and early adulthood. This was the likely reason he was kept first under the watchful eye of his brother, and then brought back to the West Country, where he was apprenticed to a solicitor in Devonport, near Plymouth. This would have kept him between Cornwall, where his parents lived, and Exeter, Devon, where his eldest brother Thomas eventually settled.Barham managed to qualify for legal practice in 1831 and moved to London. But his cast of mind was decidedly unsuited to his chosen profession, and bouts of \u2018brain fever\u2019 presented him with an opportunity to escape a career that was unlikely to bring him any real pleasure or fulfilment. During the long periods when he was unable to undertake formal work or study, he immersed himself in the collections at the British Museum.[CITATION-29] By the middle of the 1830s, he was well and truly free of the demands of a conventional career and was busily cultivating himself as a member of the London literati.[CITATION-30] He claimed later that it was around this time that he undertook numerous trips across the north of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, where he was struck by the similarities between Indian languages and those \u2018gypsy\u2019 tongues of the British Isles.[CITATION-31] This was the beginning of a long and fruitful interest in philology, but more especially in the search for connections, foreshadowings and influences across time, space and spheres of knowledge. As a result of these geographical and intellectual sojourns, Barham\u2019s interests eventually ranged across classics, theology, religious history and ancient and modern literature.So far, aside from his fragile constitution, Barham seems fairly typical of a learned and leisured gentleman of the early Victorian era\u2014and, at least as far as learning and leisure went, he remained rather ordinary. What marks him out as unusual is the sheer volume of his written work and his energetic devotion, in theory and practice, to the cultivation of the personal philosophy he called \u2018syncretism\u2019.[CITATION-32] Syncretism, or Alism in its more theological form, amounted to the universalising principle that social improvement must be predicated on the reconciliation of what had, at least in Barham\u2019s view, become artificially separated forms of mental activity: history, religion, philosophy and political thought. This kind of reconciliation, if pursued by an individual, led to the full realisation of what Barham called, rather vaguely, \u2018divinity\u2019 within that person\u2019s life. But, if pursued by a group or groups devoted to the same principles, this form of self-improvement could \u2018extend and multiply happiness\u2019 and \u2018alleviate or extinguish the misery of the people\u2019 on the scale of society itself.[CITATION-33] Thus, mental and social activities were inextricably linked and the health and wholeness of one led to the health and wholeness of the other.There are some echoes here of the Unitarian beliefs which were a strong presence in Francis Barham\u2019s immediate family. His father, Thomas Sr, had actually written against the doctrine in 1811.[CITATION-34] But Francis\u2019s oldest brother, Thomas Jr, was, at least for a time, an enthusiastic defender of Unitarianism, though he ended by disavowing all forms of sectarian dogma\u2014a theological struggle that almost certainly influenced Francis.[CITATION-35] But for all the likely influence of his family, Francis was different. While his brothers and wider family preferred relative rusticity in Cornwall and Devon, Francis preferred life in town. He immersed himself in the cultural atmosphere of London and then Bristol and Bath, and he constantly sought the company of like-minded people.Most striking is that he crafted and adapted his own unique vocabulary\u2014syncretism and Alism, but also obscure Coleridgean terminology\u2014to express his position. He also had a keen sense of the importance of the written or otherwise communicated word. Religion and politics were incidental to all his activities, but his central focus remained philosophy and \u2018the spirit of literature\u2019, or the potential for poetry, drama and history to improve the lot of men. To the young Francis, to be the author of works that people read and were influenced by was the greatest success a man could attain. By the time he arrived in London, he seemed to see himself as very much a man of letters, immersed in obscure but fundamental doctrines, and eager to reach a wider public: \u2018an adept among adepts, and popular with the people\u2019.[CITATION-36] Aside from this immediate family context, Francis Barham\u2019s ideas were also congruent with the later flourishes of romantic thought which, in reference to literature, Michael Bradshaw has called the \u2018third generation\u2019 of romanticism in the 1820s and 1830s.[CITATION-37] This was a generation whose qualities were neither typically \u2018romantic\u2019, nor wholly distinct from the earlier movement. Of course, the notion of anything like a monolithic \u2018romantic thought\u2019 is misleading: it was never a singular or unified \u2018movement\u2019, even as many of those influenced by it might have shared a range of reactionary, anti-materialist, or anti-utilitarian views.[CITATION-38] And any notion of a specifically romantic form of social thought is necessarily a reification of characteristics that have only become clear in hindsight.[CITATION-39] In Barham\u2019s own estimation, he was a \u2018syncretic\u2019, but this corresponded closely with some contemporary discourses, specifically of transcendentalism and philosophical idealism.While transcendentalism is more often thought of as an American movement, self-professed transcendentalism was an important aspect of the social groups to which Barham belonged in the late 1830s and early 1840s. And while it would be easy to dismiss both American and British transcendentalism, in contradistinction to post-Enlightenment rationalism, as irrational mysticism\u2014an episode in the history of freaks\u2014contemporary opinions were rather different.[CITATION-40] There was acknowledgement from within the philosophical community that \u2018irrational\u2019 beliefs such as those of the transcendentalists\u2014or, more precisely, ideas that did not rest solely on the reasoning faculties\u2014were by no means a barrier to thoughtful action, formal organisation or even education, and could be quite the opposite. The respected contemporary philosophical critic J.D. Morell was careful in his analysis of \u2018modern mysticism\u2019 to give sufficient credence to its less extreme varieties, which he termed philosophical mysticism. This acknowledged human beings\u2019 emotional or spiritual sensibility as a distinct but vital part of the mind, and a legitimate source of intuitive guidance that led people to higher truths. Crucially though, the emotive faculties must proceed from, rather than precede, intellectual conceptions. Extreme mysticism, Morell argued, reversed the order, making emotion and intuition anterior to reason and understanding.[CITATION-41] Moreover, despite its mystic qualities, the transcendentalism of Francis Barham and his associates had the same deep roots as the philosophical idealism associated most notably with Immanuel Kant. Indeed, Morell himself maintained that mysticism and idealism sprang from the same current, making it difficult for the historian of philosophy to trace the precise point of divergence.[CITATION-42] However, for our purposes, the most important characteristics of idealism were its conception of the world of knowledge as having an essential, underlying unity (\u2018the connected vision of the totality of things\u2019, as the Oxford philosopher Bernard Bosanquet later put it), and the centrality of a \u2018metaphysics of human nature, in which individuality was something born out of membership of a wider social whole\u2019.[CITATION-43] Even these two versions of idealism bear distinct echoes of Barham\u2019s syncretism, which emphasised the relationship between the individual and the whole, and the means of improvement being founded on the reconciliation of distinct modes of thought and action. Given this intellectual synergy, it is not surprising that much of what Barham did in this early part of his intellectual life revolved around a social set of transcendentalist thinkers, all of whom had some relationship with broader trends we could call \u2018idealist\u2019, and the historical antecedents of that philosophy.These antecedents are complex and, at least in part, cosmopolitan. David Craig has rightly noted that evidence for intense intellectual exchange between German and English philosophers is limited.[CITATION-44] But the evidence for influence is emerging, not least from the growing digital archive of small-scale periodicals and unknown authors including Barham and his friends. For Barham, German literature was \u2018the ebullient fountain of all transcendant [] science\u2019, though it was from Coleridge and others that he imbibed it.[CITATION-45] Meanwhile, the American transcendentalists openly embraced an intellectual heritage starting with Immanuel Kant, to whom they were indebted for the \u2018transcendental\u2019 of their name.[CITATION-46] For Ralph Waldo Emerson, transcendentalism was self-consciously modern, yet deeply rooted in the past: \u2018idealism as it appears in 1842\u2019, as he defined it in that year.[CITATION-47] And while Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas Carlyle are the oft-credited translators\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014of German thought for an English reading audience, there were other, less well known people who figured in this \u2018popularisation\u2019 of idealism. In particular, James Pierrepont Greaves and John Abraham Heraud had influential roles in disseminating the interconnected ideas that characterised romantic thought in the period. We can see this in their relationship with Barham: or at least, in the way he saw those relationships, and reflected on their influence on him. Greaves especially instilled in Barham the idea that unmediated, intuitive discussion was the truest form of intellectual intercourse\u2014one way, and in Greaves\u2019s mind the best way, so to speak, of \u2018practicing\u2019 culture.Greaves was a mentor to transcendentalists and educationists long before Francis Barham met him in the late 1830s. He was an inspiration to the best-known of all transcendentalists, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and his unique spirituality was admired by Harriet Martineau. Greaves was a co-operativist and mystic, sometimes referred to as the \u2018Sacred Socialist\u2019, who lived only a few doors away from Robert Owen.[CITATION-48] By the time Barham met him in 1838, Greaves was living in relative quiet at 49 Burton St., Bloomsbury, and was busying himself organising what became known as the Aesthetic Institute, a small group of people (men certainly, but possibly women also) who met to exchange views in a manner unique to the philosophy of their host.[CITATION-49] Barham was a member of the Aesthetic Institute and his various allusions to it, some of them published posthumously, are among the only surviving records of the Institute to have been produced from within its circle. Barham wrote an admiring memoir of his friend Greaves which included some account of his activities and thought and was published in 1842.[CITATION-50] The Aesthetic Institute epitomises cultural practices amongst the men and women of Barham\u2019s wider circle. It was not a formal \u2018institute\u2019 in that it had no dedicated premises\u2014the members met at Greaves\u2019s home. But Greaves had a clear agenda in mind when he formed the group, consciously opposing it to the more established and formal Literary and Scientific Institutions. Among the papers Pitman collected after Barham\u2019s death was the original \u2018Prospectus\u2019 for the Aesthetic Institute presumably publicised by Greaves at some stage. The prospectus laid out in stark language the lacuna that the Aesthetic Institute intended to fill:Notwithstanding the number of Literary and Scientific Institutions already existing, one is yet wanting. Those now established are not only exclusive in their constitution and conduct, but also sectarian in principle and character; they seem to have been erected rather for the amusement than the instruction of their members: their only means for either consists in delivering Lectures on physical and empirical subjects \u2026 The fact is, that Experimental Science had maintained so long undisputed dominion, as to lead its professors to believe that they had prescriptive right to the supremacy which it has exercised over the minds of men \u2026 but no where is there observable an Institution which has for its object the cultivation of the moral being and personal progression in self-consciousness \u2026 So great has been the cultivation and harvest of the intellectual powers, and so high their elevation in popular estimate, that many thinkers not only doubt the possibility of the tastes, sentiments, and feelings being properly the subject of education, but they doubt the very existence of any such realities as are equal or superior to the understanding.[CITATION-51] As Greaves conceived it, the Aesthetic Institute was to be the phenomenological manifestation of a corresponding aspect of the human mind\u2014a part which no amount of purely intellectual work could satisfy. This meant overcoming the pre-eminence of natural science in the prevailing educational programme, both formal and informal. Although the natural and physical sciences promised infinite improvement in material terms, they did nothing to improve people\u2019s capacity to feel, or to know why they felt; things were in such a poor state that people did not even realise their \u2018aesthetic\u2019 faculties could be improved, if they were aware of them at all. This led to confusion and decay in the individual and in culture; an over-exercised \u2018understanding\u2019 stunted the morals, taste and sentiments. The Aesthetic Institute\u2019s role was to exercise a faculty that no existing educational body had even acknowledged.Greaves\u2019s Aesthetic Institute was thus a sort of resistance movement against the supremacy of materialism. The evidence for what this resistance might look like in practice comes from Barham\u2019s recollections of the Institute\u2019s meetings. Members of the Institute were expected to engage in unmediated, intuitive discussion unobstructed by the intervention of their \u2018rational\u2019 minds or even critical analysis from their interlocutors. Barham recalled that Greaves \u2018abominated premeditation and references to learned authorities\u2019, allowing for unfettered discussion, leading to utterances of the most brilliant and astonishing kind.[CITATION-52] Their free-flowing discourse was in stark opposition to the practicality and utilitarianism of the formalised Mechanics\u2019 Institutes.[CITATION-53] They also claimed it was far more serious-minded than the (supposedly) frivolous Literary and Scientific Institutes.[CITATION-54] Thus, the implication was that the aims of the Aesthetic Institute were as high-minded as these other organisations were worldly: the Institute cultivated the sentimental faculties and \u2018moral consciousness\u2019 through the purposive practice of unmediated social intercourse.With its philosophy of artlessness, instinct and emotion, Greaves\u2019s Aesthetic Institute had a distinctly \u2018Kantian flavour\u2019.[CITATION-55] However, its unusual epistemology was even more indebted to another romantic figure, Friedrich Schiller. Schiller\u2019s aesthetic philosophy was itself directly in debt to the German educational philosopher A.G. Baumgarten, who published a multi-volume explanation of his science of \u2018aesthetica\u2019 in 1750\u201358. This has been translated as the \u2018science of sensitive knowing\u2019.[CITATION-56] This \u2018science of sensitive knowing\u2019 gestures at one of the key differences between romantic and modern aesthetics; namely, that aesthetics in its modern conception is not understood as an aspect of epistemology. That is, discourses of aesthetics are not a means by whichis acquired or conveyed. By contrast, romantic philosophy allowed for a conception of aesthetics that was at bottom epistemological. Its epistemological value lay in the capacity for sensitive perception to develop through educational processes that were analogous to those employed for intellectual and cognitive education. Thus, there was no binary division between \u2018reason\u2019 and \u2018feeling\u2019 (which roughly align with \u2018science\u2019 and \u2018art\u2019 respectively) in this particular conception of knowledge. And although Baumgarten distinguished between a \u2018higher\u2019 cognition, which was rationality, and a lower one, that of the senses, he nevertheless saw them as working in hand-in-hand. As the historian F.C. Beiser has explained, we know best what we can most clearly perceive, and thus the purpose of an \u2018aesthetic education\u2019 was to heighten the perceptive faculties and thereby expand the field of what is knowable. The development of heightened senses, especially as they helped to foster the capacity of imagination\u2014the making of an image\u2014was particularly important for artists, but also for poets and poetry. Schiller understood this, as did Samuel Taylor Coleridge and his intellectual inheritors.As Schiller put it, aesthetic education was necessary \u2018not merely because [it] can be a means of making better insights effective for living, but precisely because [it] provides the impulse for bettering our insights\u2019.[CITATION-57] The Aesthetic Institute prospectus and the conduct of the meetings echoed and amplified these sentiments. Yet by emphasising the cultivation of \u2018non-rational\u2019 faculties, in the eyes of contemporaries the Aesthetic Institute flirted with the extreme form of mysticism described by J.D. Morell, which accepted that knowledge could precede rationalism; that is, it could be revealed through something like a supernatural channel. This was a step beyond even the aesthetic rationalism of Schiller. Even so, while the views of Greaves and his followers were on the extreme margin, they nevertheless merited inclusion in Morell\u2019s up-to-date history of modern philosophy, which cast idealism and mysticism as inhabiting the same epistemological spectrum.[CITATION-58] Barham\u2019s time with the Aesthetic Institute is important because of what it reveals about his specific cultural context and, more significantly, about what the concept of \u2018culture\u2019 meant in that context. The existence of the Aesthetic Institute tells us that on a barely perceptible social level, detected from the recollections of Barham and a few allusions in the contemporary press, there was a serious discussion going on about the nature and aim of social intercourse. The Institute might be seen as a testing ground for the aesthetic principles on which social and cultural renewal should be achieved. This suggests a possible analogy between the history of science and the history of culture that has yet to be acknowledged. Historians of science have sought to understand their subject through spaces of scientific practice, such as laboratories, operating theatres and learned societies, but also less formalised environments, including pubs and clubs.[CITATION-59] They have also argued that scientific practice and practitioners were mutually constitutive; that is, \u2018science\u2019 was defined by its practitioners, and practitioners were defined by their \u2018sciencing\u2019.[CITATION-60] One could view Greaves\u2019s Aesthetic Institute as something like an analogous laboratory for culture: a space where participants experimented simultaneously with modes of thinking and modes of being and doing.[CITATION-61] We might see members of the Aesthetic Institute as \u2018practicing\u2019 culture by collectively \u2018cultivating the moral being\u2019 and consciously seeking \u2018personal progression\u2019 through a specific kind of social experience. To meet together was to experience ideal social reality in microcosm, if only for an evening. This is all merely suggestive, but this small group provides potential insights into how a particular strand of European romantic philosophy manifested itself in Britain. It is also an example of associational culture in nineteenth-century Britain contributing to the diffusion of philosophical ideas beyond disciplines, civil or formal institutions, or even conventional epistemologies.Francis Barham\u2019s friendship with Greaves and his experiences at the Aesthetic Institute impressed him deeply. His conversations with Greaves left him with the lifelong conviction\u2014one Greaves and Barham both shared with their hero, Coleridge\u2014that all human beings had some aspect of divinity within them. Meanwhile, Barham\u2019s time with the Aesthetic Institute gave him reason to believe that the means of \u2018cultivating\u2019 that divinity was the exercise of \u2018the spiritual faculty of presentiment\u2019, something beyond the rational mind that could only be achieved through a social form of being and doing.[CITATION-62] Barham put these lessons into practice almost immediately by founding his own society in 1839, which he and his co-founders dubbed the Syncretic Association.[CITATION-63] As its members were often called upon to explain, the name \u2018Syncretic\u2019 derived from the Greek \u2018to mix\u2019, and pointed to \u2018the union of distinct interests\u2019\u2014a key principle of idealist metaphysics.[CITATION-64] Thus, the principle behind the name spoke to Barham\u2019s deeply held conviction that all systems of belief, whether philosophical, religious or political, had elements of truth which could collectively be combined and reconciled once these had been sifted from error.Barham\u2019s co-founders were the young poet, John Westland Marston (1819\u201390), who was himself a reluctant lawyer, and John Abraham Heraud (1799\u20131887).[CITATION-65] By far the more involved of the two was Heraud, a poet, journalist and vocal advocate of vegetarianism. At the time of the Association\u2019s founding, he was already well known in London literary society as a high-minded interpreter of philosophical ideas for a popular audience. In the early 1830s, while Marston and Barham had been fending off the demands of office work, Heraud published reviews and digests of Continental and English philosophy, including numerous pieces on the thought of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, allowingto claim, in 1835, to have been the first periodical to offer to the reading public a \u2018correct analysis\u2019 of Coleridge\u2019s philosophy.[CITATION-66] Heraud\u2019s stock was boosted by the fact that he been acquainted with Coleridge in the latter\u2019s declining years and, when the great man finally died, Heraud was the first of his \u2018students\u2019 to give a public oration reflecting on Coleridge\u2019s life and philosophy.[CITATION-67] Even if the truths contained within the whole required painstaking elucidation, the syncretic vision was ultimately a transcendental one, like that of the Aesthetic Institute of which all three founders were members. But, unlike the Aesthetics, the Syncretics had an immediate political aim, namely the reform of stage drama.[CITATION-68] The members of the Syncretic Association all shared the view that dramatic performance was an ancient, universal art form, evident in all times and places, and it was the role of the Syncretic Association \u2018to uphold the dignity, not of the National, but of the Universal Stage\u2019.[CITATION-69] The Syncretics pursued this goal in two ways. The first was by its members encouraging each other in the production of new dramas, especially the venerable verse tragedy. Members\u2019 works were then read by the group, who were expected, regardless of the merits of the piece, to applaud its author.[CITATION-70] This indiscriminate cultivation of the \u2018dramatic element\u2019 (the similarity to the activities of the Aesthetics is clear) in its membership led to a proliferation of scripts for which there was little opportunity (or, in all likelihood, appetite) for performance. Thus, the second way the Syncretics sought to have an influence on the workings of the culture of the time was by petitioning against the Licensing Act of 1737, the antiquated piece of legislation which limited dramatic performance to the patent theatres and granted the Lord Chamberlain sweeping powers of censorship. Under increased pressure from the Syncretics, the Theatre Act was passed in May 1843 and the monopoly was broken. This marked the high point of the Syncretics\u2019 success.[CITATION-71] Although the cultural impact of the Syncretics\u2019 activities was felt well beyond the confines of its membership, syncretism itself had moved somewhat beyond the horizon of Barham\u2019s philosophic vision. As early as 1840, there were two kinds of Syncretic\u2014the dramatic reformer and the speculative philosopher\u2014but Barham was probably the only representative of the latter school. As the primary theorist of the movement, Barham almost certainly became alienated by the all-too-practical reality of the Association\u2019s advocacy work during the period 1838\u201343. The uncomfortable marriage of Barham\u2019s esoteric doctrine with Heraud\u2019s parliamentary petitioning was apparent early on, when one of the main problems faced by the Syncretics was the general bafflement caused by their alien-sounding name. According to one facetious later account, even members of the Association had to look up \u2018syncretic\u2019 in the dictionary, only to forget the definition when called upon to explain it. It was just as well then that \u2018the worthy gentleman who invented the name has never been discovered\u2019.[CITATION-72] That \u2018worthy gentleman\u2019 was, of course, Francis Barham, whose contribution to the campaign against the Licencing Act took the form of a single unperformed drama,, and a great many lectures, not about drama, but about the doctrines of syncretism.[CITATION-73] Even in the midst of advocating for dramatic reform, Barham maintained loftier ambitions for the Syncretic Association and its potential role in what he hoped would be the nation\u2019s imminent cultural reformation. As he explained in a lecture at the Suffolk Street Gallery, the Association\u2019s task was really to cultivate the theory and practice of community, or what he called the \u2018principle of association\u2019. The Syncretic Association should be above all other associations; indeed, the Syncretic Association should be composed of every other association then extant. These associations would become committees absorbed into the \u2018prior unity\u2019 of the Syncretic Association. For Barham, the Syncretic Association was to be the origin and end ofassociations.[CITATION-74] This was not quite the aim that John Heraud had in mind. Barham and the more polished and practical Heraud worked out some of their differences in the pages of the Syncretics\u2019 journal, the, of which Heraud had become the primary editor in late 1838. Barham, as part financial backer, took the role of co-editor, though he was largely silent in that office. Most of his work with the magazine was as a contributor. Of course, there was a neat concordance in the Syncretics\u2019 proprietorship of the, the same magazine that had published the poetry of Coleridge and the romantic writers of the previous generation.[CITATION-75] Heraud and Barham were conscious of their part in the romantic succession and felt a responsibility to uphold the idealism of Coleridge, its patron saint, and to assert the importance of sentimental and non-sectarian spiritual concerns in the face of rampant materialism. From their first number, published in January 1839, Barham and Heraud were in agreement on the need to depart as far as possible from the factional and consequently ephemeral quality of most contemporary periodical literature (the universality of syncretism being temporal as well as spiritual). Thus, their magazine would contain \u2018censes of the literature of the time, whether foreign or domestic; retrospective reviews and antiquarian repertories; biographical essays; discussions on all subjects interesting the church and state, or concerning the progress of science and society, philosophy and mind, in every age and country under heaven\u2019.[CITATION-76] It was to exhibit broad-mindedness and intellectual liberality as \u2018the literary representative of prothetic unity, whether in religion or in politics\u2019.[CITATION-77] Barham\u2019s more theoretical brand of syncretism found its way into the pages of the magazine and within months, thewas being acknowledged as \u2018the declared organ of syncretism\u2019.[CITATION-78] Barham expounded a specifically political version of Syncretism inspired by the polymathic French politician and serial minister of state Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Guillaume Guizot, whose 1838 essay, \u2018Catholicism, Protestantism, and Philosophy\u2019, originally published in the, Barham translated in 1839. Barham had probably sensed an opportunity to connect his own views to those of the famous statesman, and in 1840 he took it upon himself to write a series of three letters which praised the merits of Guizot\u2019s \u2018coalitionary\u2019 policies. In doing so, Barham possibly inflated and even distorted Guizot\u2019s political manoeuvring. That said, Guizot and the doctrinaires were among the most articulate advocates of political moderation in European politics.[CITATION-79] Yet even as Guizot was associated with early moderate liberalism, it was, and is, a very small step from moderation to conservatism. But Barham\u2019s professed admiration for Guizot\u2019s plastic politics meant he was in a position to suggest that syncretism was similarly non-partisan in political matters, and non-sectarian in religion. Barham went on to praise Sir Robert Peel, who, like Guizot, demonstrated malleability and moderation in the face of changing circumstance.[CITATION-80] Barham believed that it was only through self-contradiction and public criticism that a mere politician could enter the transcendental realm and become a true \u2018syncretic\u2019 statesman.Yet, as Peel\u2019s example was intended to show, the conservatism of syncretism was just a step on a journey towards holistic unity. An article in theof March 1840 compared the syncreticwith the Schlegels\u2019in Germany, and theof the French doctrinaires. These groups and their works \u2018endeavoured to unite all parties for the common good by showing that truth universal was shared among them, and that each one had specific merits as well as specific defects\u2019.[CITATION-81] Such views demonstrated an \u2018ascendance\u2019 from Toryism to a higher sphere of \u2018Catholic unity\u2019. The article went on: \u2018Many of our chief writers have made this metaphysical ascent from party to party till they have, at length, caught sight of the divine principle of a union which transcends and harmonises all\u2019.[CITATION-82] This union of opposites was a mainstay of idealism that manifested across the political spectrum, most especially in the thought of \u2018tory radicals\u2019 such as Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin and their various followers.[CITATION-83] Indeed, Barham described syncretism as \u2018true conservatism\u2019.[CITATION-84] At the same time as he was trying to establish syncretism as a political position in Britain, Barham turned his mind to a version of his \u2018system\u2019 that could be elaborated in the realm of religion. He gave this theological form of syncretism the name \u2018Alism\u2019, from the letter \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018Aleph\u2019: the beginning of everything. Barham defined Alism as the doctrine that \u2018one and the same divine truth underlies and reconciles the statements of Jews and Christians, Theists, Deists, Pantheists and Polytheists, Unitarians and Trinitarians, Catholics and Protestants\u2014One God filleth and worketh all in all\u2014one Saviour is diversely apprehended according to the peculiar idiosyncrasies of various minds\u2019.[CITATION-85] This too made its way into the pages of the, though only sporadically; most of Barham\u2019s Alistic writings were published as separate essays.Barham\u2019s increasingly unusual views must have put a strain on his relationship with John Heraud and the mainstream of the Syncretics. As one historian has put it, this was a time when to practise anything resembling eclecticism exposed one to accusations of \u2018superficial knowledge, false religious feeling, philosophical confusion, rampant literary borrowing, and intellectual laziness\u2019.[CITATION-86] The fact that Barham seemed positively to revel in his self-made doctrinal muddle understandably led to some difficulties with John Heraud.[CITATION-87] Heraud had his misgivings about Barham\u2019s vision of syncretism, but he was in open revolt when it came to any hint of eclecticism or latitudinarianism, \u2018aberrations of logic\u2019 that allowed truth and error to coexist indiscriminately.[CITATION-88] Given that he was in the midst of a campaign for changes to the law, accusations of eclecticism or \u2018indifferentism\u2019 held real danger for Heraud, so, although the two remained friendly within the same transcendentalist circles, Barham stepped down from his position at thesometime in 1840.From about 1841 until 1846, Barham busied himself with solitary literary projects. His new edition of Jeremy Collier\u2019sappeared in 1841, and a life of the German Reformation-era scholar Johann Reuchlin came out in 1843. He published his Alistic and miscellaneous writings in collections of 1844 and 1845.[CITATION-89] However, just as no politician had taken up the technicolour mantle of syncretism, Barham\u2019s Alistic doctrines garnered little reaction. He made one last attempt to found an \u2018Alistic Association for the Advancement of Divinity\u2019 (complete with prospectus, regulations and membership fees), but by 1845 he had given up professing political or philosophical syncretism or trying to gain converts to his new theology. For all intents and purposes, Barham\u2019s metaphysical system, at least under the names he assigned to it, was a cultural and intellectual dead end\u2014a freak.But that is not to say that he gave up on his principles, nor did he stop practising what he had for so long preached. After a few more years of literary work and bachelorhood, Barham left London a married man in 1847 and moved to his new wife Gertrude\u2019s home city of Bristol.[CITATION-90] There, he pursued his reforming goals in a far more pragmatic way than he had managed to do in London. One of his first engagements upon arriving in town was to give a lecture at the Bristol Institution on the subject of \u2018The advancement of literature, science, and the fine arts\u2019.[CITATION-91] The lecture was an homage to the general cultivation of \u2018useful and entertaining knowledge\u2019 by the country\u2019s many literary and scientific institutions, those \u2018excellent contrivances\u2019 by which \u2018a great variety of valuable lectures, periodicals, and books, have been given to the world, which otherwise could hardly have made their appearance\u2019.[CITATION-92] This was a far cry from the derogatory remarks about such associations made in the prospectus of the Aesthetic Institute of which Barham had been such an enthusiastic participant: a case of being unable to beat them and so reduced to joining them. But Barham was probably expressing genuine feeling when he credited the institutes with the production of cultural abundance, given the lectures, discussions, excursions and demonstrations that took place as a result of their meetings.[CITATION-93] Nevertheless, Barham went on to berate his new neighbours for allowing their intellectual culture to stagnate in more recent years. He contrasted the low attendance at lectures in Bristol with the vibrancy of the cultures of London, Liverpool and Manchester, where the local sophisticates laughed at the supine Bristolian intellect. Barham suggested a not-unexpected solution to the problem: what was needed was some unifying body, an organisation that would bring together the country\u2019s autonomous literary and scientific institutes into a universal union.[CITATION-94] Of course, he did not mention his defunct Syncretic Association, but it must surely have been in his mind.Beyond the logistical benefits such a union of institutes would bring, a transcendent authority would facilitate something which was far more important to the project of local and national cultural renewal: the cultivation of literature. By literature, Barham did not simply mean drama, poetry or the periodical press. He meant nothing less than \u2018[t]he whole mass of thought and information which has been written or may be written \u2026 the science of letters universal\u2019 comprising \u2018all thought that may be written or uttered\u2019.[CITATION-95] Here, then, was the Francis Barham of 1840, still ploughing the same metaphysical furrow. The vocabulary he used to describe his thought had shifted towards something more disciplined, but just as all-encompassing\u2014transcendental, or universalist, or idealist or syncretic. Barham\u2019s view was that \u2018literature\u2019 was a discipline, but not merely the study of texts. It was a form of metaphysics in practice: the scholar of literature \u2018in the mental experience of his single self\u2019 must \u2018live through the experience of all other men in all ages and nations\u2019. He must \u2018consider the birth, rise, progress, and decline of ideas, doctrines, and sciences\u2019.[CITATION-96] This metamorphosis, from speculative idealism to transcendentalism and syncretism, and onward to the practice of \u2018literature\u2019 as a metaphysical discipline, was not so much an evolution of Barham\u2019s thought as it was a reworking of the linguistic conventions through which he expressed his views. His practice never altered, at least in the need he felt to be socially engaged with intellectual bodies such as the Bristol Institution, and in his belief that the literatures, ideas and institutions of all times and places had some bearing on his own present circumstances: the connected vision of the totality of things.It is worth pausing to consider Barham\u2019s participation in the Institutes at Bristol, then at Bath. There were a great many similar institutes throughout the United Kingdom, many with membership in the hundreds, yet most studies of learned societies and scholarly networks, even when attentive to popular knowledge culture, continue to be constrained by a minute focus on natural science and medicine, and delimited, rationalistic categories of \u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018scholarship\u2019, or focus on an elite, usually metropolitan, group.[CITATION-97] The practices of lecturing, listening and discussion, while not as easily accessible as published works, nevertheless suggest an under-researched body of material for historians of ideas, particularly humanistic ideas.[CITATION-98] Cosmopolitan and metropolitan learned societies have a distinct and significant story to tell about the development of disciplinary and, to an extent, local identities. But less visible, sometimes ephemeral, local societies show how the practice of knowledge-making could exist on a much smaller scale and, perhaps, with different, more sociable aims. These associations and their memberships can tell us much more about the history of culture than has yet been acknowledged.[CITATION-99] Although he had not been successful in past efforts to found new associations, Barham had greater success with reviving an old one. On moving to Bath in the early 1850s, he became a member of the Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution (BRLSI). Having been founded later than the flourishing \u2018Lit and Phils\u2019 (Literary and Philosophical Societies) in Newcastle and Manchester, the BRLSI was one of the oldest of such institutions in the south-west. Many Lit and Phils did not survive more than a few years, so the continued existence of the BRLSI, though often in precarious financial circumstances, make it a success story in the movement.It was also home to a rolling cast of smaller societies, as Francis Barham discovered. When he learned of one such defunct society, the Bath Literary and Philosophical Association, which had not met since 1836, he and a like-minded set of gentlemen set about reviving the Association and scheduling a new series of meetings to commence in the winter of 1856 at the BRLSI buildings.[CITATION-100] The renewed Association was to be more than just a series of talks by bought-in touring lecturers, however. Instead, members drew up a rota and each was expected to offer a paper for the group to discuss. The aim was \u2018mutual communication\u2019 and the encouragement and cultivation of discussion about topics on which members could speak knowledgably. Both men and women would be allowed to attend, and all members, whether male or female, were eligible to submit titles for papers.[CITATION-101] Even people who were not members of the parent Institution, the BRLSI, were welcome, and the price of admission to meetings of the Philosophical Association was a very reasonable 5per year.[CITATION-102] Francis Barham was given the honour of delivering the first lecture at the revived Association, in late November 1856. His subject was \u2018the spirit of philosophy\u2019. Philosophy he defined for his audience as simply the love of wisdom. But wisdom, he went on to explain, was not identical to scientific knowledge\u2014the natural or experimental philosophy of the more scientifically minded members of the BRLSI. Barham went on to explain that philosophy harmonised nature, humanity and divinity, the last standing for the qualities of \u2018presentiment\u2019 in the human mind. This meant that the rational learning of scientific philosophy, as Barham saw it, was coextensive with non-rationalist, mystic \u2018divinity\u2019. That, Barham explained, meant that philosophy observes, but it also feels. It was this combination of observation and feeling that meant it could \u2018harmonise all objects in the universe\u2019. As the all-embracing, inclusive and eclectic discipline, philosophy \u2018makes true men and attracts them together wherever it finds them. It does not concern itself with the barriers of sects and parties \u2026 it mitigates the prejudices and partialities which spring up like poisonous weeds\u2019.[CITATION-103] Barham never wavered from his committed belief that \u2018the metaphysician \u2026 who would succeed in the nineteenth century, must not be a theoretic, but a practical man\u2019, and through actions and experiences, ideas could be defined and redefined.[CITATION-104] While Greaves\u2019s Aesthetic Institute had opposed the aesthetic faculty to the rational and cognitive, Barham\u2019s brief to the Philosophical Association seemed to bind them firmly together. In practice, this is evident in the variety of \u2018scientific\u2019 and \u2018humanistic\u2019 topics under discussion in the first months of their meeting.[CITATION-105] In 1858, the Philosophical Association hosted lectures on topics as diverse as \u2018The Skin and Food of the Ichthyosauri and Teleosauri\u2019 and \u2018Poetry as an Ordinary Human Faculty\u2019. Barham himself ended the first year\u2019s series with a lecture on\u2014what else?\u2014\u2018The Life and Writings of Coleridge\u2019.[CITATION-106] While he may not always have lived up to the billing of \u2018a practical man\u2019, Barham\u2019s success in Bath was due to his marrying his recherch\u00e9 beliefs with existing institutional norms. His ambitions for cultural reform may have lessened over time, but the Bath Literary and Philosophical Association seemed to fulfil his need for intellectual sociability and for a sympathetic audience. The pages of the minute book give a glimpse into Barham\u2019s copious interests over time, as well as his slowly failing health. One of the last times his name appears in the book is a record of his being unable to deliver a promised lecture on Persian and Arabic poetry (\u2018with specimens\u2019) due to ill health.[CITATION-107] He died in Bath in February 1871.Barham\u2019s experience offers a highly distilled vision of a diverse and idiosyncratic set of ideas\u2014idealism, transcendentalism, aesthetics, syncretism, Alism, literature, philosophy, metaphysics, wisdom\u2014and their variable use and interpretation in his thought and practice. In examining Barham\u2019s activities, I have tried to illuminate three points. First, that his ideas are part of a genealogy of metaphysical idealism, even if they have no homonym in twenty-first-century academic discourse. Secondly, that his example shows the way in which relatively ordinary middle-class people engaged with \u2018high\u2019 philosophy, as individuals, but also as part of non-academic organisations, like the Aesthetic Institute or the Bath Literary and Philosophical Association. And thirdly, that there are sources, for example in the institutes described here, that would allow historians, using a combination of conventional methods and digital augmentation, to collect and collate the intellectual experiences of a wide range of individuals and small groups and, perhaps, to build up a picture of culture as a vast, layered field of lived experience and communicable forms.In terms of the first point, Barham\u2019s syncretism and his Alism left little trace in the contemporary lexicon, and made little impact on the mainstream of contemporary political or social thought. Nevertheless, I have shown here that his ideas have an epistemology, and even to an extent a pedigree in the history of philosophical idealism. As Colin Kidd has so brilliantly shown in the case of mythography, the scholarly practice of cataloguing myths and understanding their origins has often been dismissed as little more than quixotic grasping in the primordial dark. And yet its practitioners, although some were highly irrational by modern standards, were nevertheless methodical, rigorous and erudite. Moreover, mythographic work fed the growth of linguistics, philology, comparative religion, archaeology and anthropology.[CITATION-108] However, as important as it is for intellectual historians to restore past practices to their rightful place in the history of disciplines, one could approach the entire field differently. I have proposed here that in-depth studies of the history of culture, pursued through literary and philosophical associations and the discussions had within them, could help to bridge the gap between intellectual histories of humanistic disciplines and the history of culture in practice. The outcome could be a more textured portrayal of the significance of humane ideas in past culture, long before the organisation of knowledge in formal institutions or universities.However, as Kidd\u2019s work attests, any approach to the history of past thought that is open-mindedly non-disciplinary inevitably reveals the misconceptions, freaks and irrationalisms that prevail in all times and places in some form or another. Historians might be tempted, as even E.P. Thompson occasionally was, to give in to the allure of condescension and regard someone like Barham as worthy only of being consigned, along with the irrational, mystic or otherwise suspect, to the dustbin marked \u2018freaks\u2019. After all, Thompson warned that \u2018We must not confuse pure \u201cfreaks\u201d and fanatical aberrations with the imagery \u2026 in which minority groups have articulated their experience and projected their aspirations for hundreds of years\u2019.[CITATION-109] But parsing out who is a member of a minority group and who is a pure \u2018freak\u2019 is by no means straightforward, and I cannot help but think of Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s aphorism that history is a record of the power of minorities\u2014and of minorities of one.[CITATION-110] Moreover, individual people can hold irrational and rational thoughts in their minds at the same time, and on the same subject.So, while this article has not set out to argue for Francis Barham\u2019s unappreciated significance in intellectual history, either for a specific discipline or in a more general sense, I do argue for his significance as an example of a single mind. This brings me to a final point, which is that the amalgamation of single minds could lead to fresh understandings of and approaches to the history of culture. Barham\u2019s story is part of larger, more amorphous, and less clearly mapped-out territory than the label \u2018intellectual history\u2019 can really grasp; we could call it the history of ideas, or the history of culture, or something as yet unnamed. Although Barham is only one example, there were hundreds, indeed thousands, of Francis Foster Barhams in the past: that is, thinking people whose thought and expression, however unusual, has communicated traces to the present for the historian to discover and understand. And while their words and thoughts are becoming more accessible to us through the digitisation of publications such as Heraud\u2019s, I have also tried to suggest what possibilities local Literary and Philosophical Association archives might hold for historians of humanistic ideas and knowledge.Historians with one foot in the digital future might also look to recover territory ceded during the linguistic turn: the philosophy of culture. As Ernst Cassirer and others\u2014notably the metaphysician and archaeologist R.G. Collingwood\u2014suggested in the first half of the twentieth century, stories of single minds amount to much more than the sum of their parts. To recover them is to begin, in Collingwood\u2019s words, to \u2018know the mind of another\u2019.[CITATION-111] Cassirer and Collingwood could not have anticipated the possibilities presented by new technology for collecting, collating and analysing the experiences of individuals at scale.Without doubt, the innovative interpretation of digital corpora will reveal more and more of past culture. But words, lexicons and discourses do not a reality make; historicalcannot be recovered by simply charting the words, without the minds and the lives. As Barham\u2019s example shows us, individuals, associations, institutes and informal networks help us to understand the history of cultural exchange and development through words, minds and actions. Barham saw himself as theorising and enacting the changes that would improve the social and moral condition of his era. This required the physical meeting of individuals for open discussion in conditions as unfettered by dogma, faction or self-interest as it was possible to make them. Greaves had taken that to an extreme with his aesthetic form of educative discourse, and even the dramatic wing of the Syncretic Association had cultivated its members\u2019 uncritical creative faculties above their critical analytical ones. But by the 1850s, Barham saw that it was possible to blend the cognitive with the metaphysical, and he remained committed to overcoming disagreement about political party or religious denomination\u2014these were merely material.In short, all of Barham\u2019s groups\u2014and the multitude of cognates likely to have been extant in the period\u2014demonstrate to the historian that there were a great many people who felt that specific kinds of sociability, inspired and regulated by philosophical principles, were central to the cultivation of diverse faculties and capacities of the mind, and thus to the preservation and improvement of culture. This suggests that the archives\u2014digital and conventional\u2014of these groups could reveal culture \u2018in practice\u2019 through the experience of members and their activities, discussions and reflections. In so far as these were recorded, they would make cultural processes analysable as forms of experience. To paraphrase Barham himself, these groups might make it possible for historians, within our own mental experience, to live through the experiences of others.",

This turns \u2018the humanities\u2019 into an a priori category. Still, Bod does pay more careful attention to obscure or forgotten scholars.
