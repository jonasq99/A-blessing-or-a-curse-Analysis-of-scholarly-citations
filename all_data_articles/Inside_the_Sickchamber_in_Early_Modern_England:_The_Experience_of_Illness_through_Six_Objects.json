Focusing on England.1600\u20131720, it reconstructs the patient\u2019s sensory and emotional experiences of this environment. To do so, a material culture approach is adopted, which involves the analysis of six objects from the sickroom: a physic vessel, bedcurtains, clock, mattress, sheets, and blankets. The central argument is that sickness radically altered the way people related to the things around them. When seriously unwell, the sights, sounds, tastes, smells, and tactile sensations of the items which, during health, gave rise to feelings of comfort, became sources of distress. Through this research, the article showcases the mutual benefits that an object-driven approach can bring to the twin fields of medical and material history. For the former, it sheds fresh light on the very meaning of disease in this period, showing that it was conceived as a form of dis-possession. A focus on objects also reveals a number of hitherto overlooked forms of suffering, such as \u2018swallowing a lothsome potion\u2019, tinnitus, and sleeplessness. For material studies, the article demonstrates the vital role of the senses in the \u2018emotive agency\u2019 of objects, as well as offering an opportunity to tackle the notorious challenge of the silence of many historical records on \u2018everyday objects\u2019. Confined to the sickchamber for a stretch of time, the attention of the sick rested on the things around them, eliciting comments which would have rarely been voiced in health.A painting by Jacobus Vrel (.1630\u201380), one of the lesser-known Dutch genre artists, inspired the subject of this article (). It depicts a young nurse seated on a low wicker chair, in a bright, sparsely furnished interior; her head rests in her hand after a long night of \u2018watching\u2019.[CITATION-1] Our eyes are drawn to the contrasting background space, a dark alcove bedchamber, within which lies the shadowy figure of a sick man in bed. The image made me wonder what sickrooms were like in England, a place that lacks a \u2018genre tradition\u2019.[CITATION-2] Where were these chambers located in English homes, and how did they look, sound, and smell? What sorts of objects might one expect to find in such a room, and how did these material things affect the patient\u2019s experience of illness? Focusing on seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England, this study transports us imaginatively into the sickchamber, a space which has attracted little historiographical attention, and attempts to reconstruct some of the patient\u2019s sensory and emotional perceptions of this environment.[CITATION-3] To do so, a material culture approach is deployed, which involves the analysis of six key objects from the sickroom: a physic vessel, bedcurtains, clock, mattress, sheets, and blankets.\u2018The Little Nurse\u2019 (1655), by Jacobus Vrel (.1630\u201380). \u00a9 Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford; accession no. WA1972.287.The central argument is that the material environment of the sickchamber substantially shaped the patient\u2019s sensations of sickness, and in turn illness radically altered the way that the sick related to the objects and things around them. When a person was seriously unwell, the sights, sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations of the items or spaces which during health usually gave rise to feelings of pleasure and comfort, became sources of emotional and bodily distress. This was because disease was found to \u2018assault\u2019 the patient\u2019s sensory powers, the channels through which objects were perceived in early modern thinking. Through investigating these hitherto unexplored effects of illness, the article advances our understanding of the very meaning of disease in early modern England: it shows that illness was conceived as a form of dispossession, the taking away of one\u2019s capacity to appreciate one\u2019s possessions.[CITATION-4] A focus on objects also highlights a number of common but rarely examined features of the experience of illness, each of which came to be associated with particular material possessions. These included swallowing a \u2018loathsome potion\u2019 (connected to physic vessels), \u2018sleep labour\u2019d and disturb\u2019d\u2019 (associated with clocks and mattresses), and \u2018sail[ing] thorow all those overflowing sweats\u2019 of fevers (linked to bedclothes).[CITATION-5] Ultimately, the article demonstrates that a material approach to medical history enables us to recover aspects of somatic existence which cannot be deciphered from textual sources alone. Such an approach is also particularly suitable for a study of early modern illness, since people at this time believed that bodies and matter were deeply entwined.[CITATION-6] As Steven Shapin has observed, everything on earth, from birds to bedsheets, was thought to be composed of the same four elements.[CITATION-7] Contemporary epistemological frameworks, in other words, taught that embodiment, and concepts of matter, were inherently environmental. This idea is enjoying a resurgence in \u2018new materialist\u2019 studies, with scholars such as Timothy LeCain and Ian Hodder asserting that bodies and minds are \u2018inseparable from the material world around us\u2019.[CITATION-8] The ensuing discussions lend further support to this view.At the heart of material culture studies is the idea that objects exert \u2018agency\u2019, the capacity to influence human behaviour and elicit emotion. Focusing on the latter power, Sasha Handley and Sherry Turkle refer to possessions as \u2018emotional\u2019 or \u2018evocative objects\u2019, which play a \u2018powerful role \u2026 in eliciting, and making visible, a range of entangled affective states across temporal boundaries\u2019.[CITATION-9] The present article builds on this work by exploring how such agency operated in practice: it suggests that it was chiefly the sensory qualities of things\u2014or the sensory perceptions to which they gave rise\u2014that evoked an emotional response. The darkness created by drawn bedcurtains, for instance, could elicit feelings of alarm in patients. By placing the senses at the centre of object studies, and drawing explicit connections between emotional and sensory experiences, this study offers a fuller representation of how people from the past actually felt about their material possessions. A discussion of sickness also helps tackle an entrenched challenge in the field of material culture studies: the silence of many historical records on \u2018everyday objects\u2019.[CITATION-10] Confined to the sickchamber for a stretch of time, the attention of the sick tended to rest on the things around them, and elicited comments in their personal documents which in health would rarely have been voiced. An analysis of these written sources, together with surviving artefacts, is the most fruitful way to discover how the objects were perceived at the time. This combined approach is necessary because, as Pamela Smith has acknowledged, \u2018It is really hard to investigate material objects just from the objects themselves\u2019.[CITATION-11] Since Roy Porter\u2019s call for a \u2018medical history from below\u2019 in 1985, a torrent of scholarship has been produced on the early modern patient.[CITATION-12] The first surge of research focused on people\u2019s practical responses to sickness, such as their choices of therapies and practitioners, and the quality of lay medical knowledge.[CITATION-13] In the 1990s, historians became increasingly interested in patients\u2019 bodily sensations, as exemplified by Barbara Duden\u2019s seminal text,.[CITATION-14] The burgeoning of the histories of pain and the emotions in the 2000s has significantly enriched this research, with scholars considering the emotional, spiritual and social dimensions of suffering and death.[CITATION-15] Finally, in the last two decades, the rise of material, sensory and spatial studies has inspired scholars such as Sandra Cavallo and Tessa Storey to analyse the roles of household objects and lifestyle choices in the preservation of health.[CITATION-16] Drawing these various \u2018turns\u2019 together, this article zooms in on a chapter of the patient\u2019s story which has rarely been subjected to direct historical analysis: what it was like to be inside the sickchamber.[CITATION-17] By combining insights from the interrelated histories of medicine, material culture, emotions, the senses, and spirituality, this study seeks to achieve a more holistic picture of the lived experience of sickness than has previously been possible. The research also adds to recent studies of \u2018sensescapes\u2019, the term coined by sensory historians to denote the multisensory and material qualities of particular environments, which so far includes villages, cities, markets, theatres and churches.[CITATION-18] The following types of material and textual sources form the basis of this research: a selection of extant objects; diaries, autobiographies and extemporal meditations; personal correspondence; sermons and conduct books; and medical texts, doctors\u2019 casebooks and recipe collections. Surviving artefacts are essential for providing insights into the material and sensory qualities of the sickroom, information which was often \u2018blind in plain sight\u2019 in many written sources.[CITATION-19] Medical texts and casebooks explain how disease affected the senses, and occasionally describe patients\u2019 reactions to health-related objects.[CITATION-20] Other sources of particular value are \u2018extemporal meditations\u2019, texts in which ministers and laypeople used everyday sights, sounds and activities to trigger spiritual reflections.[CITATION-21] One typical scenario was being ill in bed, which was supposed to give rise to thoughts of Christ\u2019s healing miracles and resurrection. To inspire heartfelt spiritual reflections, these passages are often highly evocative, conjuring up the feelings of the sick as they lay in bed, and frequently referring to the things in the room. Indeed, domestic objects themselves were designed with this in mind: Tara Hamling has demonstrated, for instance, that structures such as fireplaces were supposed to encourage spiritual meditation, as well as to provide physical comfort.[CITATION-22] While the above sources may seem diverse in their purposes and characteristics, they exhibit certain commonalities which make their juxtaposition in this study appropriate. Namely, most of the authors or owners embraced the same \u2018humoral\u2019 model of the human body, and came from similar socio-economic backgrounds\u2014the middling and upper echelons.[CITATION-23] In the case of clergymen diarists and physician authors, there was a degree of occupational sympathy: the care of the body and soul were connected, and ministers were often well versed in medical theory.[CITATION-24] Most religious historians now agree that the outlook of puritan clergymen differed from those of other individuals in \u2018temperature\u2019 rather than substance; therefore to use spiritual and medical sources in conjunction is reasonable.[CITATION-25] It should be noted that while the majority of the objects and texts are English, some of the published medical treatises have European origins. This choice is allowable because the basic therapeutic practices discussed in this article, and their related objects, were shared across Europe, despite some differences between countries regarding other specific aspects of health preservation.[CITATION-26] Of course, the above sources are not without their limitations: the main one in this study is the over-representation of the socio-economic elites. Obviously, to read or write required literacy and leisure time, and some of the possessions featured in this study were affordable only to wealthier individuals.[CITATION-27] Even the more basic items\u2014such as mattresses\u2014would have varied in quality between different social groups, and it is doubtful whether the poorest in society, who were living in multi-occupied dwellings of few rooms, would have been allocated a separate sickchamber.[CITATION-28] The focus of this article therefore necessarily rests on those of middling status and above. The other methodological issue to highlight is the question of whether it is ever possible to access the feelings of people from the past. It is a truism that words do not adequately capture sensory or emotional experience.[CITATION-29] Barbara Rosenwein, for example, believes that while we can \u2018understand how people articulated \u2026 how they felt\u2019, we cannot know how \u2018a certain individual [actually] feels in a certain situation\u2019.[CITATION-30] Mark Smith has made a similar point in relation to sensory experience, remarking that even if we could recreate (\u2018produce\u2019) exactly the sounds and other sensations of the past\u2014a task fraught with difficulties\u2014we can never hope to \u2018consume\u2019 them in the same way as our ancestors, due to cultural changes.[CITATION-31] Nevertheless, I am inclined to take a more optimistic stance, agreeing with Monique Scheer that the divide between the outward expression, and inner experience, of an emotion or sensation has been overstated. She believes that manifestations of feelings\u2014through words or gestures\u2014are inseparable from the emotions themselves.[CITATION-32] The same could be said about Smith\u2019s distinction between the \u2018production\u2019 and \u2018consumption\u2019 of a sensory perception, since what one hears (or sees, smells, and so forth) must influence how one perceives it.[CITATION-33] From this position, itpossible to gain insights into past feelings: the chosen method is to analyse how contemporaries defined, described and depicted their sensations and emotions, uncovering the historically specific meanings behind particular aspects of illness and their associated objects.This article focuses on serious physical illnesses that were treated at home. Further, comparative studies will be necessary to establish in what ways the sensescapes of other healing spaces diverged from the domestic sickchamber, such as the hospital, birthing chamber, and apothecary\u2019s shop.[CITATION-34] By \u2018serious\u2019, I mean diseases which caused considerable bodily suffering, loss of function, or posed a threat to life. This category may seem somewhat amorphous, but in early modern England the common features of illnesses were emphasised much more than they are today. This was partly due to the way disease was defined in Galenic medicine: it denoted impairment in the performance of faculties, caused by the \u2018distemperature\u2019 or corruption of the body\u2019s \u2018humours\u2019 (constituent fluids), a theory that was applicable to all ailments.[CITATION-35] The Church reinforced this unifying approach to illness: conduct books usually deal with sickness in a single chapter, teaching that all illnesses are the fruit of sin, and have in common such things as being \u2018confin\u2019d to thy Bed\u2019 and \u2018wholly entertain\u2019d with the Extremity of thy pains\u2019.[CITATION-36] The timeframe of this study\u2014.1600\u20131720\u2014witnessed significant developments in the production and distribution of material goods.[CITATION-37] With the notable exception of clocks, the items analysed in this study were available throughout the period to those who could afford them, but it is undeniable that the numbers of possessions present in sickchambers must have risen over time.[CITATION-38] Even among the poor, Craig Muldrew has shown a significant increase in ownership of household goods during the period, including some of the items examined in this article.[CITATION-39] In view of these trends, it can be conjectured that the impact of material culture on the experience of illness must have grown during the period for almost everyone. In the medical sphere, the volume and variety of available drugs expanded over the early modern era, but the basic principles that underpinned treatment\u2014the Hippocratic-Galenic theory of the humours\u2014dominated well into the eighteenth century, despite the rise of competing theories.[CITATION-40] With respect to medical treatment, therefore, the picture is one of continuity.Since the emotions and senses are integral to this study, it may be helpful to explain the meaning of these concepts, and how they were thought to be connected. In Aristotelian thinking, the dominant philosophical tradition in early modern England, the emotions were known as the \u2018passions\u2019 of the soul or mind; they were defined as \u2018motions\u2019 (physical movements) of the middle part of the triangular soul, the \u2018animal\u2019 or \u2018sensitive soul\u2019, which were instigated for the preservation of the human.[CITATION-41] Like the passions, the \u2018external senses\u2019 were functions of the sensitive soul, and were regarded as essential for survival\u2014they enabled living creatures to distinguish between beneficial and pernicious environments.[CITATION-42] Influenced by both Aristotle and Galen, most vernacular medical writers accepted that there were five senses\u2014sight, sound, smell, taste and touch\u2014each of which required \u2018three thinges\u2019 to work: \u2018an Object\u2019 (\u2018Colours, Sounds, Odors, Sapors and Tactile qualities\u2019), \u2018a\u2019 (such as light, air or spittle), and \u2018an Instrument or Organ\u2019 (the eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin).[CITATION-43] Although the precise workings of individual senses differed, the basic process can be summarised as follows: the object emitted its essential quality to the medium, which was then imbibed by special receptacles in the sensory organ (such as \u2018teats of the tongue\u2019, tastebuds).[CITATION-44] Next, the data entered the nerves at the back of the sensory organ, from where it was carried by special vapours called \u2018animal spirits\u2019 to the brain, and collected together in the \u2018common sense\u2019, the faculty responsible for processing all sensory information.[CITATION-45] At last, this information was passed to the \u2018imagination\u2019, which created an overall mental image of the external world, or in our case, the sickchamber; it was this mental picture\u2014\u2018the mind\u2019s eye\u2019\u2014to which the soul responded with its passions.[CITATION-46] Owing to the perceived \u2018love that is betwixt the body and soul\u2019, the soul usually reacted with joy and delight to sensations which the imagination judged to be sweet or pleasant, while anything bitter or painful to the senses provoked distressing passions, such as grief or disgust.[CITATION-47] It is crucial to note, however, that these processes were affected by a person\u2019s state of health: as this article shows, when serious illness struck, the senses became temporarily \u2018misaffected\u2019.[CITATION-48] Typically, each of the sensory powers was either dulled, heightened or distorted by disease, so that, for instance, soft noises seemed loud, or sweet flavours, bitter, perceptions which in turn brought emotional distress to the soul.[CITATION-49] It was these \u2018depraved\u2019 sensations that explained why illness altered the way people felt about their material possessions.After a brief discussion of the location of the sickchamber, the article is structured around the various objects to be examined. The choice of objects is determined by two criteria: the first is the regularity with which the item appears in accounts of sickness. At the height of serious illness, most patients were in bed, which is why the bedstead and its furnishings feature heavily. This would come as no surprise to Angela McShane and Joanne Begiato, who have shown that the bed was \u2018literally, economically, spiritually, and \u2026 emotionally at the centre of the domestic sphere for much of the early modern period\u2019.[CITATION-50] Secondly, the selection of objects is based on their potential to yield a multisensory analysis, which illuminates visual, aural, olfactory, gustatory and tactile aspects. Such an approach responds to recent pleas in sensory studies to investigate several senses together, on the grounds that in practice they do not work in isolation.[CITATION-51] It might seem strange to think that an object could be tasted, but in line with current historiographical trends, this article embraces a broad understanding of material culture, which includes liquid consumables such as medicinal potions as well as durable, solid objects, including pewter cups and wooden clocks.[CITATION-52] Indeed, the term \u2018material object\u2019 is defined here as \u2018a thing made or consisting of matter\u2019, a meaning which obviously includes liquids.[CITATION-53] Over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, room use was becoming increasingly specialised in England, with beds gradually migrating from multipurpose ground-floor \u2018halls\u2019 to upstairs chambers, a change facilitated by the emergence of the hearth and improvements in staircase architecture.[CITATION-54] Although this development was slow and uneven across society as a whole, the economically privileged families featured in the present study usually did have upstairs bedrooms.[CITATION-55] It was within one of these chambers that the sickbed was located. This is evident from the tendency of patients to mention the first time they were able to goafter an illness: such a movement was a milestone during recovery, a symbol of returning health.[CITATION-56] The rationale behind confining the patient to a bedchamber was to reduce the risk of infection to the rest of the household, while shielding the sick person from the hustle and bustle of the living quarters and street. As the Suffolk medical writer Phillip Barrough (d. 1600) advised in a bestselling medical text, \u2018long quiet and rest to the patient\u2019 should be granted, so that \u2018Nature\u2019, the body\u2019s internal healing agent, could devote all its energies to the \u2018office & work\u2019 of overcoming disease.[CITATION-57] The sickchamber was either the patient\u2019s accustomed bedchamber, which in health was likely to have been shared with other relatives or servants, or an unoccupied guest room.[CITATION-58] Whether or not patients moved out of their normal chamber would have depended on their status, age, and position within the family. During the dangerous illness of baby Nally Thornton from Yorkshire in 1654, her mother Alice also fell very sick; initially the two lay in adjacent chambers, but the \u2018great shriks\u2019 of the \u2018poore childe \u2026 frighted me [so] extreamely\u2019, wrote Alice, that little Nally was \u2018remov[ed] into the Blew Parlor, a great way off [from] me\u2019.[CITATION-59] In 1663, Samuel Pepys (1633\u20131703) recorded that his \u2018disorder [of] the blood\u2019 forced him to \u2018keep my bed\u2019, where \u2018I \u2026 slept \u2026 alone (my wife lying in the red chamber above)\u2019.[CITATION-60] Thus, it was more likely to be those higher up the household hierarchy\u2014parents or husbands\u2014who remained in their own bedchambers during sickness. Lower down the social scale, where space was more restricted, instead of installing the patient in a separate chamber, the communal areas of the household may have been rearranged, with a degree of separation achieved through partitioning off part of the room with a panel, or by \u2018framing the bed itself\u2019 as the sickchamber.[CITATION-61] Even within homes that were large enough to accommodate a separate sickchamber, there must have been considerable variation in the size and sumptuousness of the room.Having introduced the sources and the sickchamber, the first of the six objects shall be examined: the vessel of physic. In Hippocratic-Galenic medical theory, most remedies were thought to work by assisting the body\u2019s internal healing agent, Nature, in the expulsion of noxious or surplus humours from the body, the perceived cause of disease.[CITATION-62] Numerous types of evacuative treatments were offered, from bloodletting to blisters, but here the focus is on purging potions (laxatives), one of the most common forms of medicine. The key ingredients were herbs of varying degrees of bitterness, from the extremely pungent plants wormwood and aloes to the comparatively mild rhubarb, which were taken infused in liquids like beer or wine.[CITATION-63] It was the bitterness of these substances that made them effective: this quality was thought to help evacuate the bad humour by reason of its \u2018natural familiarity\u2019 (similarity) to the said humour. Quoting Hippocrates, the Dutch physician Levinus Lemnius (1505\u201368) explained that \u2018Physick[,] when it come[s] into the body, it first \u2026 draws unto itself, that which is most \u2026 like unto it, then it moves the \u2026 humours \u2026 and forceth them out\u2019.[CITATION-64] This idea, known to laypeople as well as doctors, explains the belief that \u2018the medicine must be as bitter as the disease\u2019 for it to work.[CITATION-65] It is not easy to establish with certainty what types of vessels were used for the storage and serving of purging medicines.[CITATION-66] Only rarely did patients and their families provide this information in their personal documents, perhaps because it was assumed to be too obvious to need stating. One exceptional account can be found in the diary of Elizabeth Walker (1623\u201392), a puritan minister\u2019s wife: in 1671 she gave her 13-year-old daughter \u2018five or six spoonfuls\u2019 of purging potion \u2018in a silver cup\u2019, which \u2018she received of me without \u2026 the least reluctancy\u2019.[CITATION-67] Elizabeth offered this unusual detail because she was so amazed at her daughter\u2019s willingness to take the medicine: \u2018her stomach did so nauseate\u2019 everything, that she had feared the girl would refuse the purge.[CITATION-68] For pious women like Elizabeth, the material composition of the cup may have held spiritual significance: silver was the traditional substance from which the communion chalice was composed.[CITATION-69] As such, the sight of this cup\u2014and its feel in the hands and on the lips\u2014may have given rise to meditations on the blood of Christ, and His willingness to heal the sick. A silver cup dating from around the same time is held at the Victoria and Albert Museum (). The curators have inferred its medicinal function from its characteristic shape and design: the double handles could easily be gripped by the weak patient, and its sturdy, \u2018baluster\u2019 structure meant it would not easily topple over. One side of the cup is embossed with an image of a lion, an animal which Nicole Mennell believes symbolised divine majesty as well as human strength and fierceness.[CITATION-70] These associations may have been intended to inspire courage in the face of illness, while reminding the sick to seek God\u2019s blessing before taking a sip. The other side is decorated with an image of a unicorn, a creature often believed to be real in this period, and one which was known for its speed, strength and purity, and for the medicinal potency of its horn.[CITATION-71] Such ideas may have helped raise patients\u2019 confidence in the efficacy of the medicine, making them think it would work quickly and powerfully. Decorative silver vessels, however, were hardly likely to have been within the budget of the majority of households, and even among middling groups it is probable that pewter and earthenware were far more common materials. Pewter manufacture flourished across Europe in the seventeenth century, only declining slightly in the early 1700s when crockery began to take over; Craig Muldrew has shown that already by the late 1500s three-quarters of labourers in his inventory sample owned pewter goods.[CITATION-72] Less liable to break than earthenware, pewter may have been deemed suitable for the shaky hands of a weak patient. Clues about physic vessels are also provided in manuscript recipe books, wherein writers instruct on medicine dosage and administration.[CITATION-73] A remedy containing the laxative senna, for instance, was to be \u2018put \u2026 into Glass Bottles\u2019 stopped with corks, and taken \u20182 or 3 spoonfulls\u2019 at a time.[CITATION-74] Other recipes recommend mixing the potion (or powder) into the patient\u2019s normal drink\u2014usually beer\u2014which suggests that it would have been drunk from an ordinary drinking vessel, such as a tankard.[CITATION-75] Medicines might also be given in posset, a milky strengthening drink, and served in a \u2018posset cup\u2019 such as that shown in, discussed below.[CITATION-76] Caudle cup (.1670), unknown maker. \u00a9 Victoria and Albert Museum, London; museum no. CIRC.980\u20131925.What role did the vessel play in the experience of illness? The visual qualities of these items evoked strong emotional reactions in patients, a finding which demonstrates the agency of objects. William Bullein (.1515\u201376), a physician and minister from Durham, commented that many patients have such \u2018fearful eies\u2019 that \u2018it no lesse greveth the[m] to behold or see the vessel, in which the pocion is kept \u2026 than to drinke the same \u2026 bitter medecine\u2019.[CITATION-77] The material composition of the vessel was key\u2014Bullein implied that transparent containers, made of glass, were especially likely to elicit distress in patients, because they could spy the \u2018blacknes\u2019 of the liquid.[CITATION-78] Other authors suggested that for some patients, the sight of the vessel did not just induce an emotional reaction: it also brought about a physical one, in the form of purging. The expert on melancholy Robert Burton (1577\u20131640) mentioned a patient cited in the works of Cornelius Agrippa, who, after a \u2018memorable and distasteful purge\u2019, was \u2018so much moved,of the cruze [i.e. container], though he never so much as smelled\u2019 the medicine, \u2018would give him a purge; nay, the very remembrance of it would effect it\u2019.[CITATION-79] Medical authors attributed this purging power to the affective capacity of body parts, and the sympathy between organs, the imagination, and memory: the sensory organs, stomach and bowels were endowed with an exquisite tenderness or sensitivity, which made them sympathise with, and react to, one another\u2019s sufferings.[CITATION-80] As Burton implied, the memory of taking a medicine could be so unpleasant that it permanently altered the patient\u2019s feelings about the vessel. Indeed, this idea was so widespread that it appears in religious writings as a metaphor for expressing spiritual truths. In a discussion of false and true friends, for instance, the London clergyman Thomas Adams (1583\u20131652) remarked that after taking a \u2018lothsome potion\u2019 the patient will \u2018ever after hate the very cruze it was brought him in\u2019.[CITATION-81] Having considered patients\u2019 reactions to the sight of physic vessels, we can turn to their responses to the bitter taste and smell of the medicine itself. The word \u2018bitter\u2019 was defined by medical writers as \u2018An unpleasant and ungrateful savor \u2026 from things taken in \u2026 [which] causeth molestation\u2019.[CITATION-82] \u2018Savor\u2019 (or \u2018sapour\u2019) referred both to odour and flavour: smell and taste were thought to work by \u2018mutuall consent\u2019\u2014the tongue and nose were located close together, and the sensory data took a similar route to the brain.[CITATION-83] The etymology of the word bitter provides clues to the somatic experience of this quality: it comes from the Old English, which means \u2018biting, cutting, sharp\u2019, adjectives associated with acts of violent penetration.[CITATION-84] This made sense from a physiological perspective: smells and tastes were often envisaged as material things, which literally passed into the sensory organs. Tastes were \u2018watery juices\u2019, which the \u2018spongy flesh\u2019 of the tongue was able to absorb, while a scent was a \u2018fume, or vapor\u2019, which penetrated the \u2018sivelike Bone\u2019 at the back of the nose.[CITATION-85] An evocative insight into the imagined reaction of a patient to the gustatory qualities of these drugs is provided in a translation of Boccaccio\u2019s, published in English in 1620: \u2018[as] soone as\u2019 the man\u2019s \u2018tongue tasted the bitter Aloes, he began to cough and spet extreamly, as being utterly unable to endure the bitternesse\u2019.[CITATION-86] Adriaen Brouwer\u2019s painting \u2018The Bitter Potion\u2019 () vividly illustrates the patient\u2019s gestural reaction: the man\u2019s face is contorted in an expression of utter disgust\u2014his mouth gapes open, his brows are deeply furrowed, and his eyes are tightly screwed up.[CITATION-87] Although this painting is Flemish, English patients responded to bitter medicines in a similar manner. Joseph Hall, for instance, described how he would \u2018turne away my head, and make faces, and shut mine eyes; and stop my nostrils, and nauseate, and abhorre to take this \u2026 potion\u2019.[CITATION-88] Contemporaries explained these gestures by referring to the movement of the \u2018vital spirits\u2019, the highly purified vapours which were responsible for carrying out the vital functions of the body and soul: sensations of bitterness made these spirits flee in opposing directions from eyes, nose, mouth and other \u2018outward parts\u2019, so that the patient\u2019s whole face appeared distorted.[CITATION-89] It was not just the body that reacted to these bitter sapours: owing to the perceived affection between the body and soul, unpleasant tastes and smells also evoked emotional suffering, a tendency evident from the use of the word \u2018bitter\u2019 to denote any form of mental distress, especially grief and spiritual guilt.[CITATION-90] Indeed, the association between mental suffering and the bitter herbs aloes and wormwood was so well known that these ingredients were deployed as metaphors for all sorts of emotional anguish.[CITATION-91] \u2018The Bitter Potion\u2019 (.1636\u20138), by Adriaen Brouwer (1605/6\u201338). St\u00e4del Museum, Frankfurt am Main; CC BY-SA 4.0.So far, this discussion has focused on the sensory experience of physic. The materiality of the vessel itself could influence how a medicine smelled and tasted, as scientists have shown.[CITATION-92] For instance, corked bottles and lidded cups would not have emitted much smell until the moment the stopper or cover was removed, in contrast to wide-brimmed, open vessels, from which the scent may have been evident across the room.[CITATION-93] Cups with spouts, a design intended to prevent spillage when a medicine was taken in bed, would have limited the volume of liquid entering the mouth, while exposing a smaller proportion of the tongue to the medicine and distancing the drinker\u2019s nose from this substance.[CITATION-94] Such properties may have had paradoxical effects, reducing the immediate impact of the unpleasant flavours, while prolonging the time it would have taken to drink the purge., held at Manchester Art Gallery, is an apt example: dating from.1670\u201390, this globular tin-glazed cup has a long spout that runs from the neck to the base. Although intended primarily for posset, a strengthening drink made from hot milk curdled with ale or wine and flavoured with sugar and spices, it is likely that it was also used for medicines.[CITATION-95] We know that flavour is influenced by the shape of the vessel and its connotations\u2014the more rounded the receptacle, the sweeter it seems to taste.[CITATION-96] The curved shape of this vessel, together with its association with sweet posset, might have made bitterness less perceptible. Finally, the taste of medicine may have been affected by the vessel\u2019s material composition. Marta Ajmar believes that people in this period were \u2018responsive to the smell and the taste of earth\u2019, and certain pieces of pottery were \u2018celebrated for the taste that they brought to the food that was cooked in them\u2019.[CITATION-97] The same could be said of medical vessels. Pewter cups, for instance, may have given off a sharp taste, owing to the tendency of acidic substances to interact with the lead contained within this material.[CITATION-98] Posset cup (1670\u201390). Manchester City Galleries accession no. 1923.327, bequeathed by T.T. Greg. Photograph kindly supplied by Sasha Handley.It should be noted at this point that bitterness was not always the defining quality of purging potions. Doctors were aware that if the medicine was too disgusting, the patient would be likely to refuse it, or to spit or vomit it up before it had had its desired laxative effect.[CITATION-99] To prevent this from happening, it was suggested that the \u2018cunning Physician ... tempereth his bitter medicines with sweet and pleasant\u2019 ingredients.[CITATION-100] By adding sugar or some other sweetener, the drug would remain in the stomach long enough for the medicinal effects to take place. Such an intervention, carried out by lay practitioners as well as physicians, was particularly important when it came to treating children, whose intolerance of bitter tastes was notorious.[CITATION-101] However, these adaptations were not always effective: a common complaint from patients of all ages was that the potions continued to taste bitter. Recalling a recent illness, the natural philosopher Robert Boyle (1627\u201391) observed that some of his remedies had been \u2018sweetened with as much Sugar, as if they came not from an Apothecaries Shop, but a Confectioners. But my Mouth is too much out of Taste to rellish anything\u2019.[CITATION-102] The Galenic explanation for these altered perceptions was that during acute sickness the tongue is \u2018filled with some strange fluid\u2019, which mixes with the gustatory juice of the medicine, so that \u2018all things would seem salty to taste, or all bitter\u2019.[CITATION-103] So familiar was the experience of altered taste that religious writers found it a useful metaphor to invoke when describing the more abstract idea that sinners fail to relish wholesome counsel. The Yorkshire minister Thomas Watson (d. 1686) wrote in his treatise on repentance, \u2018Tis with a sinner, as it is with a sick Patient[:] his pallat is distempered; the sweetest things taste bitter to him: So the word of God which is sweeter than honey-comb, tastes bitter to a sinner\u2019.[CITATION-104] In short, the vessel of physic\u2014a ubiquitous object in the sickroom\u2014generated unpleasant multisensory reactions in patients, despite the fact that most individuals recognised that bitterness was the essential quality of an efficacious medicine.[CITATION-105] The next object for analysis is the bedcurtain, the \u2018visually defining element\u2019 of the early modern bed, and a furnishing which proliferated in English homes during the seventeenth century, even for the very poor.[CITATION-106] As far as the sick were concerned, the main function of bedcurtains was to protect the body from the dangerous effects of cold draughts.[CITATION-107] Recovery from illness involved the outward movement of bad humours from the interior, \u2018noble\u2019 organs to the exterior, less vital parts; warm air helped promote this centrifugal motion by encouraging perspiration from the skin, whereas cold air reversed this process.[CITATION-108] The curtains also shielded patients from bright light, something which those in severe pain could not usually \u2018abyde\u2019.[CITATION-109] David M. Mitchell has shown that, while there was considerable variation in the material composition of bedcurtains between households and across time, when it came to decoration there was a common theme: imagery of the outdoors.[CITATION-110] Two rather superior examples can be seen at Manchester Art Gallery: the first () is a pretty crewel-work drape, dating from 1680\u20131730, and brightly coloured with exotic pink tulips and leaves, a design known as the \u2018tree of life\u2019. The other example (), from 1660\u201380, is a white twill-linen hanging, embroidered with blue-green wool to look like the curling feathers of birds. It is possible that such designs were created partly in the interest of health: garden scenes provided patients with an imaginative escape to the outdoors, which in turn was thought to exert a healing effect on the body. Carole Rawcliffe has shown that the \u2018delectable sightes and fragrant smelles\u2019 of the outdoors were regarded as therapeutic in premodern England: these sensory delights could help invigorate the spirits, the instruments through which the body\u2019s healer, Nature, operated.[CITATION-111] The colour green, so prominent in garden imagery, was deemed especially beneficial.[CITATION-112] Owing to the perceived power of the \u2018phantasy\u2019 over the body, it was thought to be possible for patients to reap these health benefits simply by imagining the associated sensations. In the case ofand[CITATION-6] these would have included the sweet scent of tulips, and the melodic singing and soft feathers of birds.[CITATION-113] While we might think that embroidered imagery would have been the preserve of the wealthy, Sasha Handley has shown that in fact it was possible to \u2018personalise\u2019 one\u2019s curtains without great expense.[CITATION-114] Bed curtain (1680\u20131730).

Photograph kindly supplied by Sasha Handley.What was it like lying behind the curtains? The impression conveyed in the personal documents is that it could be a dreary experience, giving rise to feelings of boredom, or, to use the contemporary term, \u2018tedium\u2019.[CITATION-115] In 1711, the North Yorkshire coal trader Henry Liddell (.1673\u20131717) complained to a friend, \u2018Methinks the time of my confinem[ent] very tedious ... which is now near 5 weeks and may be as much longer\u2019.[CITATION-116] It was partly the lack of ocular stimulation that made bed so dull\u2014encircled by curtains, there was little to see beyond the surrounding drapes. It might seem strange that patients complained of visual blandness\u2014as was highlighted above, bedcurtains could be highly decorative. However, when the curtains were closed, the bedstead was probably quite dark, even in the daytime, so it is unlikely that the sick would have been able to see the decoration very clearly.[CITATION-117] The disease itself could accentuate this lack of visual acuity. The Swiss physician Felix Platter (1536\u20131614) reported that patients suffering from smallpox and other acute diseases often complained of \u2018suffusions\u2019\u2014the appearance of \u2018Flies, Smoak, Cobwebs, Filaments, and such like, before [their] Eyes\u2019. He also noted that those afflicted with diseases caused by hot or dry humours, such as convulsions or \u2018burning Feavers\u2019, might experience temporary blindness, due to the desiccation of the optic nerve.[CITATION-118] Even if the eyesight was not affected in these ways, it was only a matter of time before the sight of the curtains became monotonous. In the words of Charles Cotton (1630\u201387), \u2018Around the place they cast their mournful eyes \u2026 And spy no Scenes, but those of yesterday. The same \u2026 objects still salute their eye\u2019.[CITATION-119] In any case, the suffering of sickness tended to obliterate the sensory pleasure that might otherwise have been felt when looking at beautiful curtains. This is neatly encapsulated in one of Henry Peacham\u2019s (b. 1578) epigrams: he lamented that the presence of worldly comforts to a \u2018Soule-sick\u2019 mind will \u2018Confere\u2019 the soul \u2018no more unto it\u2019s ease \u2026 Then do rich curtaines and a Canopie With pearle and gold embroyder\u2019d all about\u2019 to a man \u2018who lies [sick] upon the gout\u2019.[CITATION-120] Further insights into the experiences of life inside the curtained bedstead are provided in spiritual handbooks and extemporal meditations. The Anglican bishop Jeremy Taylor (1613\u201367), described the scene as \u2018dressed with darknesse and sorrow\u2019, the patient\u2019s eyes \u2018dim as a sullied mirror\u2019 for want of light.[CITATION-121] Although darkness may have been easier on patients\u2019 eyes than light, the former carried a burden of its own. Erin Sullivan has shown in her study of sadness that this emotion was closely associated with the humour melancholy, a jet black substance.[CITATION-122] Such a link was reinforced by Christian teachings, which invariably associated dark spaces with the frightening concepts of death, hell and sin.[CITATION-123] Hell was envisaged as a place of \u2018\u2019, into which the reprobate were cast: it was this pitch blackness, wrote the Presbyterian Christopher Love (1618\u201351), which is most \u2018apt ... to make the hearts of men to tremble\u2019.[CITATION-124] No doubt the darkness of the curtained bed actively fostered fears of hell in patients, since the contemplation of damnation was a key duty during illness, part of the religious preparation for death.[CITATION-125] This was the case for the parliamentarian army officer William Waller (.1598\u20131668): when he awoke \u2018in a dark Night\u2019, he recalled, \u2018all things about me \u2026 [were] swadled up in bands of thick darkness\u2019, and he mused that it is not surprising \u2018that the most horrid things that we can imagine (it self) are represented by this\u2019.[CITATION-126] Waller uses a material metaphor to describe his experience\u2014he feels \u2018swaddled\u2019 up, a reference to the practice of tightly wrapping infants in cloth; the darkness is so impenetrable that he imagines the curtains to be enveloping his whole body and face.[CITATION-127] An even more common metaphor invoked in this context referred to prison, a place obviously associated with physical constraint as well as darkness: the bedstead was the cell, and the curtains, the walls.[CITATION-128] The high churchman John Kettlewell (1653\u201395) went as far as to declare that confinement to the sickbed was a \u2018more irksome and afflictive\u2019 experience than prison, since \u2018your \u2026 Bed \u2026 is a narrower Compass than a Prison is\u2019.[CITATION-129] The prison metaphor was probably chosen for its religious associations: the Bible makes over one hundred references to imprisonment, some of which conjure up the sense of confinement and gloom felt by the sick: Psalm 107, for instance, describes the prisoner as sitting \u2018in utter darkness \u2026 suffering in iron chains\u2019.[CITATION-130] The environment of the curtained bedstead not only gave rise to religious reflections. It could also spur alarm about more worldly things. Robert Boyle described how, during his violent fever, there was a small gap in his bedcurtains, through which he had been able to discern the \u2018Dim light of the Candle\u2019. Suddenly, this light \u2018considerably increas\u2019d\u2019, which made him suspect that \u2019twas \u2026 a Thief\u2019 in the room. He put his \u2018Head out of the Bed to see whence \u2026 [this] unexpected \u2026 light proceeded\u2019, and found, to his relief, that it emanated instead from a fault in the tallow candle, which had caused it to blaze in an \u2018irregular way\u2019.[CITATION-131] The curtains had acted as a visual obstacle, making Boyle feel vulnerable and defenceless; perhaps the fever was partly responsible for his delusion, with the heat affecting his imagination.[CITATION-132] In short, life behind the bedcurtains, however ornate, commonly evoked feelings of tedium, and spiritual and temporal unease.The next pair of objects for analysis are clocks and mattresses, items which crop up most regularly in accounts of sleeplessness, one of \u2018the uneasiest accidents that attend[s] \u2026 sickness\u2019.[CITATION-133] Doctors attributed insomnia to the corruption or evaporation of a special sleep-inducing vapour in the brain, which in health brought sleep by blocking the nerves.[CITATION-134] Patients were more inclined to blame pain.[CITATION-135] Among the middling and elite in society, sleeplessness was measured chiefly by the hourly chiming of the clock, a consumer good which proliferated rapidly in the second half of the seventeenth century.[CITATION-136] The aforementioned Robert Boyle recalled that during his illness in the 1660s, \u2018I \u2026 observ\u2019d how long time seem\u2019d to intervene betwixt \u2026 the striking of the Clock\u2019, and exclaimed, \u2018I think I miss\u2019d not hearing one stroke of the Clock all the Night long\u2019.[CITATION-137] This strange impression of time, which David Woods describes as \u2018the languorous way in which time itself can seem to unfold\u2019, was commonly observed during periods of physical or mental anguish, cropping up in poetry, plays and prose.[CITATION-138] For Boyle, so \u2018extraordinar[il]y long\u2019 did the time seem between the chimes that he began to suspect that the instrument, like its owner, must be \u2018ill-going\u2019. He \u2018call\u2019d out\u2019 to his nurse to fetch him \u2018the Watch I use to measure the time\u2019 in his scientific experiments, and found his clock to be an hour slow.[CITATION-139] This is an apt example of the reciprocal relationship between illness and objects: sickness undermined this man\u2019s trust in his clock, and the object itself seemed to embody the patient\u2019s sickness. The accuracy of timekeeping had improved by the mid-seventeenth century, thanks to the introduction of the pendulum, which replaced the old balance wheel escapement, a mechanism that had only allowed quarter-hour accuracy; the slowness of Boyle\u2019s clock must therefore have been all the more notable to its owner.[CITATION-140] As well as altering patients\u2019 attitudes to their clocks, illness seemed to affect their aural and emotional experience of these instruments. In times of health, the sounds emitted by clocks were usually described favourably. John Smith (. 1673\u201380) noted in his handbook onthat when the \u2018hammer strike[s] \u2026 the Bell \u2026 its sound is clear and ful[,] without intermixture of harshness and Jurgelling\u2019.[CITATION-141] As signifiers of wealth and status, these \u2018emotional objects\u2019\u2014like other luxury goods\u2014commonly evoked feelings of satisfaction and pride.[CITATION-142] During sickness, however, the association between clocks and sleeplessness, together with the physical effects of acute illness on the sense of hearing, may have rendered these sounds unpleasant\u2014the chimes seeming muffled rather than clear, harsh rather than mellow. During fever, for instance, it was common for patients to suffer from what Platter called \u2018internal sound preternaturally raised in the ears\u2019 (tinnitus), which \u2018mixes itself\u2019 with external sounds. Tinnitus was often said to sound like the \u2018shrill\u2019 noise which is heard when a \u2018little Bell\u2019 is struck; the resulting cacophony of internal and external chimes must have been \u2018no smal trouble to a man\u2019.[CITATION-143] Such experiences were no doubt exacerbated by the more general tendency of acute illnesses\u2014and especially those accompanied by headaches\u2014to render the patient intolerant of noise of any kind. The Genevan physician Th\u00e9ophile Bonet (1620\u201389) noted in his casebook that one of his patients was unable to \u2018endure the least noise\u2019: the slightest sound made him think \u2018a Knife was run into his Brain\u2019.[CITATION-144] This metaphor is indistinguishable from the types invoked in descriptions of physical pain, a finding which sheds fresh light on the relationship between pain and the senses in early modern perceptions.[CITATION-145] Whereas in modern western medicine pain is regarded as a sense in its own right\u2014\u2018nociception\u2019\u2014Galenic doctors saw it as \u2018inherent to all the [five] senses\u2019, and judged any type of sensory discomfort as falling into this category, including irritating sounds like chiming clocks.[CITATION-146] Unlike the previous objects examined in this study, it is probable that the clocks that produced the sounds described above were not located in the sickchamber itself, but in other rooms: they were unlikely to have been kept in bedchambers, because they would have awoken the sleeper. This inference is supported by studies of inventories, which show that throughout the early modern period these items tended to be listed in descriptions of halls and parlours rather than in upstairs chambers.[CITATION-147] In the 1680s, a new type of clock was developed, the \u2018Night Clock\u2019, which was much more suitable for the bedchamber: it contained a lamp, and so enabled the sleeper to tell the time without a candle or chime. An example can be seen in the collections of the British Museum; the numerals are cut out of brass, which allows light from an oil lamp or candle to shine through.[CITATION-148] These items were rare, however, perhaps because they were a fire risk. A far more common type of clock in English homes was the \u2018lantern clock\u2019, a timepiece invented around the beginning of the seventeenth century, and widely available from the mid-1600s.is a typical example: made in London in 1650\u201360, this timepiece is made of brass, and is designed to be hung on the wall, or to stand on a bracket. The large bell would have been audible throughout the house, so that even if the clock was not in the sickchamber, the wakeful patient would have been able to hear the chimes, along with the winding sound of the ringing mechanism.[CITATION-149] Insights into how these clocks may have sounded are provided in the BBC\u2019s Sound Effects database, though we must remember we lack the \u2018period ear\u2019\u2014as well as the state of sickness\u2014to hear the chimes as early modern patients would have done.[CITATION-150] Lorna Weatherall has commented that while clocks were present in homes of varying degrees of wealth, people from the lowest socio-economic groups would not have been able to afford these items.[CITATION-151] For poor patients, the passing time was probably measured by changing light patterns, together with outside sounds, such as roosters crowing, cows mooing and church bells ringing.[CITATION-152] Lantern clock (1650\u201360), by Richard Ames in London. \u00a9 Victoria and Albert Museum, London; museum no. M.49\u20131995, bequeathed by E. Canziani.The other object which recurs in descriptions of sleeplessness is the mattress, known in the early modern period as the \u2018bed\u2019. Sasha Handley has shown that in this period it was fairly common in wealthy households to stack up to three mattresses on one bedstead: the bottom mattress was usually made of hard-wearing material like straw, to give the sleeper a firm base; the middle mattress would then be composed of wool or horsehair, substances known for their warmth; and the top mattress was stuffed with a softer, cooler, and more expensive material, such as linen, cotton ticking, or feathers.[CITATION-153] Although designed for comfort, mattresses were usually found to be uncomfortable during serious illness, especially when the patient was unable to sleep. A physician from Kent, Everard Maynwaringe (b. 1627/28), observed:iswhich makes yourand yourTheofmakes \u2026 sleep that was [once] stretch[ed] out, fromto the fairbroken into pieces, andthethat before seemedis now too; and the downy bed presseth hard against the bones.[CITATION-154] As with clocks, the patient\u2019s prolonged contact with the mattress during the wakeful hours of the night seemed to make time move more slowly, an impression which Maynwaringe linked to the effects of sickness on the sense of touch. Many acute illnesses left the skin highly sensitive, a state today known as allodynia; this was what made the soft mattress seem hard. In the case of chronic disease, patients often became emaciated, and it is likely that some may have developed pressure ulcers; the resulting protuberance of the bones greatly contributed to the apparent hardness of the bed.[CITATION-155] This was the case for 12-year-old Caleb Vernon, sick of a long consumptive disease in 1665: when his father asked him \u2018how he did\u2019, he replied that his \u2018\u2019; his thigh measured \u2018not full four inches about\u2019, and his bones were \u2018so sharp as if they would pierce his skin\u2019.[CITATION-156] These sharp sensations may also have been the result of a change of mattress: when patients were vomiting, sweating and undergoing other evacuative symptoms or medical treatments, it is likely that the top feather bed was temporarily removed, and replaced with one stuffed with more absorbent, coarser materials, such as seaweed, sedge, or chaff, which could withstand the emission of bodily fluids.[CITATION-157] A contemporary proverb states that \u2018A downe bed is soft to lye on, but yet it soakes the bodie\u2019.[CITATION-158] shows one such replacement mattress, which has fortuitously survived to the present\u2014it was found boarded up in a loft in a house in Titchfield, Hampshire.[CITATION-159] The top layer of sedge is twisted into large plaits, so as to help maintain the bed\u2019s structure when wet; this distinctive form must have felt lumpy and hard to lie on. In the case of infectious diseases, these mattresses were supposed to be destroyed after use, since they were deemed to be a source of infection\u2014saturated with the putrid humours that had caused the disease, they were perceived as sick, rather like Boyle\u2019s \u2018ill-going\u2019 clock.[CITATION-160] Clearly, this mattress was never used during illness, which is why it has survived; it instead functioned as loft insulation.[CITATION-161] Of course, lower down the social hierarchy, beds may always have been uncomfortable: rather than sleeping on feather mattresses, servants and labourers were more likely to have rested on beds made from compacted straw, at least at the beginning of our period.[CITATION-162] Carex mattress from Titchfield, Hampshire (1600s). Museum of English Rural Life (MERL), University of Reading, object no. 61/242.The final objects for analysis are bedsheets and blankets, items which can be referred to collectively as the bedclothes. The quality and composition of bedsheets varied greatly between households\u2014and even between bedchambers\u2014but the favoured material was linen, a textile made from woven flax.[CITATION-163] Blankets were usually composed of wool, and placed on top of the sheets; in one inventory sample, the mean number of blankets per bedstead was 1.8, but this figure is likely to have changed with the season.[CITATION-164] shows a high-quality linen sheet from.1600\u201332, with the letters \u2018E.B\u2019 and \u2018B.H\u2019 embroidered in blue cross-stitch, initials of the owners, perhaps a husband and wife. Sasha Handley has suggested that, as \u2018cherished personal objects\u2019, sheets and blankets \u2018formed a tactile bridge between the waking and sleeping worlds \u2026 eas[ing] people\u2019s journeys into restful slumber\u2019 by evoking pleasant sensations. Linen sheets, for example, were known for their smoothness and connotations of purity, while blankets forged feelings of warmth and security.[CITATION-165] As revealed below, serious illness usually obliterated these positive experiences to the extent that the objects themselves could be classed as unwell.Sheet (1600\u20131632). \u00a9 Victoria and Albert Museum, London, museum no. T.54\u20131958.In accounts of sickness, the bedclothes are mentioned most frequently in descriptions of sweating. As was stated earlier, recovery involved the evacuation of excess or malignant humours from the body: during fever, the body\u2019s healing agent, Nature, achieved this expulsion by making the patient perspire.[CITATION-166] The Dutch doctor Ysbrand van Diemerbroeck (.1609\u201374) explained that the physician\u2019s role was to assist Nature by ensuring that the patient was \u2018well cover\u2019d with Blankets and other Coverings, and so be provoked to Sweat\u2019.[CITATION-167] There was also a visual element to this process. James Primrose (1600\u20131659), a Paris-educated doctor, observed that when treating diseases characterised by pustules physicians often endeavoured to facilitate the evacuation of humours by covering the sick with \u2018red cloaths\u2019. It was thought that there was \u2018an affinitie\u2019 between this colour and the blood, and so by draping red blankets over the patient, the blood and other humours would \u2018spring \u2026 forth into [the surface of] the skin\u2019, where they could be safely expelled via the pustules.[CITATION-168] Despite understanding that sweating was the route to recovery, most patients found it an \u2018afflicting\u2019 or \u2018uneasy\u2019 experience.[CITATION-169] Typically, the skin felt clammy and wet against the sheets, qualities in this period classed under the sense of touch, and trickling sensations were perceived as the moisture flowed down the body.[CITATION-170] The quantity of evacuated matter could be startling. In 1658, Lady Ann Fanshawe\u2019s husband, Sir Richard, contracted a \u2018very ill kind of fever\u2019, which put him into \u2018perpetual sweats \u2026 so violent that it ran down day and night like water\u2019.[CITATION-171] The \u2018unmeasurable sweat\u2019 suffered by the Leeds antiquary Ralph Thoresby (1658\u20131725) was \u2018almost inconceivable \u2026 insomuch, as not only the sheets \u2026, but blankets and rug, were daily dried by the fire\u2019.[CITATION-172] Women patients were less inclined to mention sweating in their diaries than men\u2014it carried masculine connotations of violent exercise or sexual activity\u2014but occasionally their husbands describe it.[CITATION-173] The politician Simonds D\u2019Ewes (1602\u201350) told his mother that his wife, Anne, \u2018as she lay in bedd, \u2026 very ill\u2019 was in \u2018soe extreame a sweate as it turned all shee had on into a muck wett\u2019, a muddy puddle.[CITATION-174] Sweating under the bedclothes was a thermal experience, as well as a wet one. A universal complaint of feverish patients was the feeling of excessive heat or cold, qualities once again falling into the realm of touch in this period.[CITATION-175] Robert Boyle observed that if you were to enter his sickchamber during his fever, and see him \u2018not only cover\u2019d, but almost oppress\u2019d, with [bed]Cloaths, [you] would confidently conclude, that, whether or no I be distress\u2019d by the contrary Quality [i.e. heat] \u2026 I cannot at least be troubled with Cold\u2019. \u2018But alas!\u2019, he cried, \u2018in spight of all that lies upon me, an internal Frost has so diffus\u2019d itself through every Part, that my Teeth chatter, and my whole Body does shake strongly enough to make the Bed itself do so\u2019.[CITATION-176] This extract conveys the acoustic, as well as the tactile, experience of temperature, which must have been audible to others in the room.[CITATION-177] The cold sweat of fever was usually followed by an equally unbearably hot one. Boyle recalled that, as the heat took over, \u2018I threw off the Cloaths much faster than\u2019 they had been laid upon him in the former fit, and \u2018I, that could a little before scarce[ly] feel all that had been heap\u2019d on me, could not now support a single Sheet\u2019.[CITATION-178] As a wealthy gentleman, Boyle\u2019s bedsheet was probably a \u2018holland sheet\u2019 like, made from fine linen cloth that originated in the Low Countries, and a material prized for its coolness and lightness.[CITATION-179] Sickness reversed these thermal and tactile qualities, making the sheets seem hot and heavy. Clearly, Boyle had servants at his beck and call to fetch or relieve him of bedclothes, and no shortage of these items. Among the poor, where access to these material goods was more limited, the experience may have been rather different.Having discussed the tactile sensations associated with sweating under the bedclothes, we can turn to those of an olfactory nature. While I have no wish to resurrect the now largely rebuffed notion that premodern society was smelly, it is undeniable that many sickbeds were associated with unpleasant odours.[CITATION-180] The physician Hermann van der Heyden (1572\u20131650) sympathised with the patient who longed to be \u2018freed from the filthy Stench, wherein he lyes wrapped up\u2019.[CITATION-181] Sweating\u2014along with other bodily emissions\u2014was often described as \u2018noisome\u2019, the term used by contemporaries to denote anything unpleasant to the senses, especially smell. In the mid-1640s, John Evelyn (1620\u20131706) was \u2018infinitly afflicted with heat & noysomenesse\u2019 from being \u2018kept \u2026 warme in bed for 16 dayes\u2019.[CITATION-182] As Evelyn implies, the main reason for this great stench was a failure to \u2018shift\u2019 (change) the bed linen. It was not laziness or olfactory insensitivity that explained such a seemingly neglectful practice. After all, in normal circumstances bedsheets and nightclothes were heavily laundered, as Susan North has demonstrated.[CITATION-183] Rather, during acute sickness many people believed that it was actually \u2018extream Dangerous\u2019 to change the patient\u2019s bedclothes.[CITATION-184] The aforementioned physician Levinus Lemnius \u2018severely commanded\u2019 that the \u2018Shirts, Sheets, Coverings, Linnen ought [not] to be changed\u2019 until \u2018undoubted signes of health shew themselves\u2019, on the grounds that such shifting would \u2018presently indanger \u2026 their lives\u2019.[CITATION-185] Changing the linen usually involved taking the patient out of bed, an action which it was feared would cause the pores of the skin to close, thereby reversing the outward direction of the bad humours.[CITATION-186] In the case of contagious diseases such as plague, there was an additional deterrent: changing the linen might infect the person who undertook this chore, since it involved contact with sheets soaked with the cause of disease\u2014bad humours. Effectively, the sheets and blankets had become ill themselves, so sick in fact that they could not be \u2018cured\u2019 by laundering, but instead had to be destroyed.[CITATION-187] There was, however, disagreement between medical practitioners around this issue: some authorities claimed that a failure to shift the bedclothes could actually exacerbate the sickness. In her bestselling guide for housewives, Hannah Woolley (1622\u2013.1675) criticised the \u2018vulgar error of not suffering the diseased \u2026 person to change his linen often\u2019: not only would it \u2018offend the noses of Visitants\u2019, but it \u2018much discourageth and dejecteth the sick person\u2019.[CITATION-188] In turn, this emotional distress would \u2018sink\u2019 the patient\u2019s \u2018natural spirits\u2019, the vehicles through which the body\u2019s internal healer Nature worked, so that this agent lacked sufficient strength to expel the disease.[CITATION-189] A patient\u2019s joyful response to being put into clean bedclothes is described vividly by the French surgeon Ambroise Par\u00e9 (1510\u201390) in his printed clinical observations: one Lord Auret was afflicted with a \u2018great fever\u2019 following a gunshot wound; for two months he had lain in the same sheets. The \u2018putrid vapors\u2019 of his sweat, \u2018soaking in the sheets\u2019, brought \u2018disdain and loathing\u2019 to the patient, took away sleep and appetite, and \u2018cause[d] the spirits to \u2026 acquire an ill quality\u2019.[CITATION-190] At last, the surgeon ordered \u2018a bed to be made \u2026 where there were [laid] clean white sheets\u2019, into which the patient was lifted. Lord Auret \u2018rejoyced much\u2019 to be \u2018taken out of his foul stinking bed\u2019, immediately fell asleep, and began to get better.[CITATION-191] The state of the sheets was thus a matter of life and death, a perception which encapsulates the perceived potency of objects at this time.It should be mentioned that even when the bedclothes were not changed, strenuous efforts would have been made to mitigate the unpleasant odours of the sickroom. The London physician Stephen Bradwell commanded that during acute diseases \u2018all the houshold-stuffe\u2019 should be \u2018perfumed\u2019 to make the \u2018ayre \u2026 sweet\u2019.[CITATION-192] Holly Dugan and Evelyn Welch have shown that the use of fumigations and perfumes was a common measure during sickness.[CITATION-193] Unfortunately, however, the sick probably derived little olfactory relief from such interventions. Speaking of perfumed quilts, bedclothes and head coverings, Th\u00e9ophile Bonet warned that \u2018very strong scented things \u2026 cannot be endured\u2019 in some diseases: such smells \u2018make the Head to ake, and cause a turbulent motion in the Spirits\u2019.[CITATION-194] This experience was attributed, once again, to the pernicious effects of disease on the senses: the patient \u2018judgeth the Scents of things not such as indeed they are, but falsly \u2026 as when [one] thinks those [things] that smel wel, do stink\u2019.[CITATION-195] A description of the sickchamber by the Oxfordshire clergyman Robert Harris (.1581\u20131658) sums up this article\u2019s main argument. He mused that inside this space, you shall find \u2018solitarinesse, sadnesse, light shut out, misery shut in \u2026 children weeping, wife sighing; the husband groning\u2019. He continued, \u2018those senses & parts\u2019 which bring the healthy man comfort \u2018occasion the sick man trouble\u2019: \u2018the sight of his cupps, glasses [and] boxes makes him sicke, the smell of his meates[,] [makes him feel] sicke, the taste of his drinkes[,] sicke, the least noyse offends him \u2026 his bed tyres him, his chaire troubles him\u2019. Harris concluded, \u2018poore man, hee is not well, and therefore nothing is well about him; he is sicke, and so all the world is made of sicknesse to him\u2019.[CITATION-196] This vignette draws attention to a previously overlooked dimension of illness: the tendency for sickness to adversely affect a person\u2019s sensory powers, which in turn radically altered their perceptions of the things around them. Serious illness transformed what normally would have been objects of satisfaction\u2014shiny drinking vessels, soft mattresses, decorative curtains, resonant clocks and scented bedclothes\u2014into sources of sensory and emotional distress. Such an experience renders intelligible the proverbial sentiment of the time, \u2018He that enjoyes his wealth Must alwaies live in health\u2019.[CITATION-197] As well as affecting patients\u2019 sensory powers, sickness was thought to have the capacity to change the objects themselves, rendering them \u2018sick\u2019. Mattresses and sheets, for example, became so saturated with excreted body fluids, the perceived cause of illness, that they sometimes needed to be destroyed. Clocks were suspected of being \u2018ill-going\u2019, due to the elongated way in which time seemed to pass during illness.What are the implications of these arguments for the histories of medicine and objects? For the former field, the idea that sickness affected patients\u2019 attitudes to their possessions illuminates the bigger concept of disease in early modern England. It suggests that illness was defined as a dis-possession, since the sick felt they were no longer capable of appreciating their material goods. Such an observation is confirmed by the use of the verb \u2018recover\u2019 to denote the restoration of health: this word derives from the Anglo-Norman and Middle French, which means to repossess.[CITATION-198] Thus, when patients got better, they regained not just their physical faculties and ease, but also their enjoyment of their possessions. Recollecting his own recent illness, Harris mused, \u2018Sicknesse put me out of possession of all, but with health all is come back againe\u2019.[CITATION-199] For many patients, this experience must have been literal as well as metaphorical, since sickness could be an expensive episode, owing to the necessity of taking time off work, and paying physicians\u2019 and nurses\u2019 fees.[CITATION-200] A discussion of objects has also brought to light various forms of suffering which have tended to be missed in the historiography of illness experience, such as sleeplessness and fever. These symptoms may not be as dramatic as pain\u2014the topic whichattracted considerable attention in the literature\u2014but to people at the time they all contributed significantly to the feeling of illness.[CITATION-201] This article has necessarily focused on the socio-economic elites. Given that sickness was fundamentally conditioned by the number and types of objects owned, it is likely that poorer people\u2019s experiences of illness may have differed considerably. It is to be hoped that further research, using sources such as hospital records, might provide some insights into the material experiences of poorer patients.By demonstrating the reciprocal relationship between objects and illness, this article has a significant bearing on material culture studies. It showcases an essential principle in this field: the idea that things are \u2018not just passive social constructs but rather active and dynamic forces\u2019, which shape our emotional and bodily experiences of life.[CITATION-202] Objects interacted with, and sometimes accentuated, sensations of illness, such as the sharp taste of physic, \u2018noyse in the eares\u2019, and \u2018fiery sweats\u2019. In turn, the emotions evoked by these forms of sensory suffering were perceived to play a major role in the patient\u2019s illness, either aiding recovery, as in the case of green curtains and red blankets, or exacerbating disease, as we saw for those patients who became \u2018impatient of the Stinking smell\u2019 arising from the sheets.[CITATION-203] Essentially, it was the patient\u2019s senses that provided the link between objects and experiences, a point of connection which I hope may foment fruitful dialogue between the histories of material culture, bodies and medicine, and emotions.[CITATION-204] While this study has emphasised the distressing aspects of life inside the sickchamber, I wish to end by noting that there could be a spiritual silver lining to the material experience of illness, which serves as a useful reminder of the gulf that exists between early modern and modern ideas about the senses and objects in western culture.[CITATION-205] Throughout the period of this study, many people seem to have lived through two spheres\u2014the body and soul\u2014and each part was thought to be equipped with its own set of senses: the disturbance or deprivation of the body\u2019s senses during sickness could serve to enhance the acuity of the spiritual senses, with wonderful soteriological consequences.[CITATION-206] Robert Boyle remarked that the darkness of the curtained bedstead makes the patient begin to \u2018take some notice of his own [spiritual] Condition[,] and his Eyes, for want of outward Objects, are turn\u2019d inwards\u2019 to inspect the state of his soul; this heightened spiritual perception inspired repentance, and ultimately paved the way to paradise.[CITATION-207] ",
