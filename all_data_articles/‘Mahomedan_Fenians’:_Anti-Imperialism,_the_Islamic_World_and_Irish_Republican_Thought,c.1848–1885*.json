    "article": "If Irish republicanism (or Fenianism) after 1848 was sometimes articulated through the critique of British imperialism in Afro-Asia, by the 1870s the Fenian command and journalists writing for the Irish-American republican press were taking a marked interest in Muslim societies under British rule. This interest developed steadily from the Indian Rebellion of 1857\u20138 to the Great Eastern Crisis of 1875\u20138, analysis of the latter illuminating the additional potential possessed by those frontiers where imperial rivalries could be manipulated to exhaust and abrade British power and prestige. Afghanistan\u2014a buffer between British India and Russian Central Asia\u2014held great promise, and the eruption of the Anglo-Afghan War (1878\u201380) presented an opportunity for the Irish cause: support for Afghans might precipitate the disintegration of British coercive power, providing in turn the opportunity for Ireland\u2019s emancipation. Focusing on the writings of the Fenian command and reportage in the US-based, this article shows the attentiveness of Irish patriots to the spectral power of the world of Islam, which haunted the European powers, and their subversion of the Orientalist categories constructed to demonise Muslims, particularly those from the frontier most resistant to European imperialism. Fantastical and opportunistic, this short-lived burst of interest was the culmination of a longer-term process, one revealing the embeddedness of Fenianism within a world-historical moment marked by numerous imaginative projects constitutive of Islam as a world religion and a (latent) world power, and, thus, the imperial, trans-imperial and global geographies of Fenian thought.The historically unparalleled acceleration in the volume of traffic and velocity of circulation during the global age of steam and print precipitated a predicament of mobility for imperial governments.[CITATION-1] On the one hand, not only roads but also railway, steamship and telegraph lines extended the state\u2019s bureaucratic reach further and deeper into the lives of subjects, hastened the mobilisation and deployment of force in the face of disorder, and more effectively embedded official ideology and national or imperial propaganda.[CITATION-2] On the other hand, the unchecked movement of persons, cheap postage, and access to uncensored periodicals and printed books threatened to undermine state power, for such motilities permitted the spread of seditious ideas and subversive plots, not to mention critique of the precipice of class (and caste) privilege, ethnic or racial superiority and patriarchy upon which political authority rested.[CITATION-3] If such technologies of connection and control made empires more muscular and aggressive in the era of the New Imperialism, so too, therefore, did they nourish the vigorous critique of colonialism and the articulation of anti-imperialisms.By the end of the nineteenth century, Tim Harper observes, European imperialism had formed a Euro-Islamic condominium, since the European powers\u2019 indirect rule relied on Muslim elites and armies recruited heavily from Muslim communities.[CITATION-4] \u2018In the heyday of empire\u2019, David Motadel likewise notes, \u2018Britain, France, Russia, and the Netherlands each governed more Muslim subjects than any independent Muslim state\u2019. In turn, this closer proximity led to the construction both of an \u2018Islamic world\u2019 and of Islam as a \u2018world religion\u2019 by Orientalist scholars and their interlocutors\u2014the men on the spot\u2014even as Islam\u2019s variations and the peculiarities of its localised forms were brought to light by these conversations.[CITATION-5] At the same time, Western technologies connected even the more far-flung pockets of Muslim believers, whether through networks of print or the growth of the annual Hajj pilgrimage, for example.[CITATION-6] And, thus, nineteenth-century globalisation gave substance to what had hitherto only been a notional worldwide community of Muslims ().[CITATION-7] But this idea of imperialism as a \u2018Euro-Islamic condominium\u2019 can be interpreted in another way; at once a stylised fact characterising the nuts and bolts construction of European power and yet laying bare the weakness in the very foundations of empires. Were the Islamic crescent to rise up, the Christian powers might find it impossible to maintain their supremacy in Africa and Asia. Whether realistic or not, the possibility of a unitedbecame the bogeyman of European imperialism, particularly from the later nineteenth century. In part, this fear was stoked by the appearance of such figures as Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1839\u201397).[CITATION-8] Al-Afghani, whoseor epithet claimed Afghan nativity (despite his birth in western Iran), sojourned repeatedly in British India from his late teens\u2014where he was initially thought to be a Russian spy\u2014with numerous important periods in central Asia, Iran, Russia and the Ottoman domains. He witnessed the crisis of Islam in its confrontation with Western empires and modernity from multiple vantage points within the Muslim world, from European-ruled (formerly Muslim) states to European suzerainties (nominally ruled by Muslim dynasts), from cosmopolitan centres such as Bombay and Istanbul to the frontiers of nomadic society in Arabia and the central Eurasian steppe. He was a vociferous critic of British imperialism in the Muslim world, his thought intersecting with the ideology of what was termed \u2018pan-Islamism\u2019 by the late 1870s and 1880s. Broadly, this entailed the uniting of the \u2019as a political body; its aims encompassed fighting European imperial domination in the Islamic world.[CITATION-9] Much scholarly attention has focused on the British imperial state\u2019s anxiety about the supposed threat of Islam or on Muslim subjects\u2019 optimism about pan-Islamism.[CITATION-10] But what, this article asks, was the standpoint on Islam\u2019s potentiality taken by-Muslims as they formulated their own critiques of imperialism?The creation in 1876 of the title of(Emperor/Empress of India) allowed the London press to trumpet Britain\u2019s status as the world\u2019s greatest Muslim power by virtue of the vast number of Muslim subjects under British rule in India combined with those in its other colonies. The first Delhi Durbar was held on 1 January 1877. It marked the proclamation of Queen Victoria as Empress of India and was attended by the Viceroy of India, Lord Lytton (1831\u201391), the vassal rulers of the Indian princely states and other British Indian elites. It was a lavish event\u2014all pomp and vastly changed circumstance\u2014the rituals, symbols and spaces connected with Mughal authority \u2018desacralised\u2019 and repurposed in the legitimation of British power.[CITATION-11] Thousands of miles away from Delhi and London, the Irish-American weekly, the, published on its front page a cartoon entitled \u2018John Bull as a Mohammadan\u2019. It satirised the claim that Britain (John Bull) was a Muslim power in any respect, seeing it as \u2018misrepresent[ation]\u2019 manufactured by \u2018her venal press\u2019.[CITATION-12] Sharply critical of British imperialism and its handmaiden, the British media, the cartoon was typical of content appearing on the pages of that newspaper. The Ottoman Empire\u2014ruled by a Muslim dynasty\u2014was at the time in the midst of another war with Russia. Britain offered assistance to the \u2018Turk\u2019 only because it was in British interests to counterbalance Russian expansionism at the expense of the Ottomans in the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean, and only in so far as such support did not damage Britain\u2019s international standing or drain her resources.[CITATION-13] \u2019s reportage offers a window onto how non-Muslims conceived the potentiality of the Islamic world in the formation of their anti-imperialismwas a thoroughly transnational production with a trans-imperial or global purview, was central to the Fenian cause and closely connected to the Fenian command structure, and yet has scarcely been studied.This article is about the development of anti-imperialism within the Irish-American diaspora in a context in which news travelled rapidly from faraway places to engender a globally engaged mass media, in which the British Empire was understood by contemporaries as constituent of the worldwide Euro-Islamic condominium, and in which Irish patriots were articulating their own critique of the. As sites critical to the formation of various sections of popular opinion, if not necessarily quite reflecting the diversity of societal attitudes, Irish newspapers have yielded much material to scholars interested in the relationship of Ireland to the British Empire, especially, most recently, Jennifer Regan and Jill Bender (on India), Matthew Kelly, Michael de Nie and Paul Townend (on Africa and Asia more broadly).[CITATION-14] Although understandings of this relationship are necessarily embedded within this article, the larger ambition is neither to revisit the now-vexed issue of whether Ireland and her relations with England before 1922 can be characterised as colonial, nor to elaborate Irish contributions to the British Empire and press the point of Ireland\u2019s relevance to British imperial history.[CITATION-15] On the contrary, much as the diasporic actors who contributed tosought to unshackle themselves from the British yoke, so the aim here is to unshackle scholarly analysis from the Ireland/Britain/British Empire framework. Their anti-imperialism was formulated within a political universe that was larger than the confines of the British Empire and can thus more appropriately be situated within a-imperial or global framework.In the first place, the paper\u2019s contributors were situated outside the British Empire, and looked upon events from a North American vantage point for a North American (as well as Irish and Irish-British) audience. Secondly, they were acutely aware of Britain\u2019s rivalry with other European powers\u2014including Russia\u2014which they sought to exploit in the precipitation of some great convulsion at the global level that would provide the opportunity for Ireland\u2019s freedom. They were also witness to British expansion in the era of the New Imperialism, when British power pushed deeper into the continental interior of Asia and Africa, reaching its \u2018natural frontier\u2019 in thick jungles, uncharted deserts or rugged uplands, from where the Irish-Americans could hear the creaking noises of an over-extended British Empire.[CITATION-16] If historians have lately turned to frontiers and fringes to study those sites where (European) imperialisms were weakest or most contested, the fact was evidently palpable to contemporaries, upon whom the potential of such sites for the instigation of political revolution was not lost, as we will see.[CITATION-17] Finally, they recognised the (perceived) threat Islam posed to British rule, not least because the British\u2014and other European powers\u2014were facing some of their fiercest resistance from Muslim societies by the middle of the nineteenth century.[CITATION-18] In a fascinating and wide-ranging study, Niall Whelehan has highlighted the numerous ways in which the Fenian movement was transnational, whether in terms of the constitution of its membership, the engagement with scientific, philosophical and political ideas from outside the network, or the concern with events in faraway places.[CITATION-19] In this respect, Whelehan\u2019s insistence on theframe is curious, since Fenianism seems so very much a product of theage of steam and print described above. Fenianism\u2014in action\u2014was not only opportunistic, but also staged on a geography that was global in scope. In the late 1860s, the Fenians launched raids into Canada to force Britain to withdraw from Ireland, at the same time supporting exploits in Ireland, Britain, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand. From the late 1870s, they turned to other locales in the British Empire\u2014in Asia and Africa\u2014when these places became embroiled in conflicts that looked ready for prodding and agitating into a larger crisis of imperial governance. The significant challenges posed by the Zulus and the Boers in southern Africa, for example, received considerable coverage in the Irish press, as well as on the pages ofand in the Fenian leaders\u2019 private correspondence.Thus, as this article shows, Fenian anti-imperialism in the late 1870s is best studied within a trans-imperial or global framework. This approach more precisely illuminates the ways in which the Fenians understood the potentiality of imperial rivalry, of the fringe and frontier sites between empires, and of the peoples (particularly Muslims) who could not naturally be confined within the artificial borders of nations or empires. It was along India\u2019s frontier with Afghanistan that the Fenians perceived the coalescence of these potentialities for the emergence of an all-consuming imperial climacteric, making it an especially significant site for the hopes of the Irish republican cause. It is to understanding the development of this (albeit, short-lived) convergence\u2014the interest in \u2018Mahomedan Fenians\u2019\u2014that this article is devoted.The endeavour is necessarily in dialogue with Townend\u2019s examination of the Afghan War in the Irish press, but is distinct from that analysis in the following respects.[CITATION-20] It seeks to place Fenian interest in Afghanistan in a larger context, one that is attentive to contemporary discourses about Islam and the politics of the so-called Great Game between British India and Russia on the eve of the Afghan War (1878\u201380). To prise open such subjects, the point of departure in the second section is\u2019s reportage of the Great Eastern Crisis, specifically the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20138. Furthermore, the analysis centres on, delving deeply into its critique of empire, rather than taking stock of the tenor of the Irish press at large, as Townend and others have done. Instead, the Irish-American perspective helps \u2018decentre\u2019 the narrative outside the British Empire as part of the larger \u2018trans-imperialist\u2019 (if not globalist) project at hand. Such concerted focus on one periodical and set of voices also helps tease out the role of frontier sites and of Muslim societies in Fenian thinking (respectively examined in the third and fourth sections), whether in their wildest fantasies of an imperial crisis or in their use of similitude and comparison as a means of articulating anti-imperial thought. We begin, however, with a survey of the entanglement of Ireland and the Irish with India after 1848.That 1848 (or, rather, 1848\u201351) marked a watershed of sorts for much of Europe has been given greater credence by scholarly work undertaken since the sesquicentenary of the revolutions.[CITATION-21] Britain\u2019s political establishment saw out 1848 relatively unscathed, however; the Young Irelander Rebellion, which drew its passion from the horror of the unfolding Great Famine (1845\u20139) and its courage from events unfolding on the Continent, was what Se\u00e1n McConville characterises as \u2018the slightest kind of insurrection\u2019, and was small-scale and thus easily quashed.[CITATION-22] Yet, albeit in a roundabout way, working through increasingly global networks springing up in its wake, the flowering of Irish discontent in 1848 also had lasting repercussions for Britain and the British Empire.[CITATION-23] Some of the Irish rebels were rounded up and imprisoned; others escaped, most notably James Stephens (1825\u20131901) and John O\u2019Mahony (1815\u201377), who settled in France.[CITATION-24] O\u2019Mahony relocated to the United States in 1856, where, with Michael Doheny (1805\u201363), he established the Fenian Brotherhood in 1858. On instructions from O\u2019Mahony the same year, Stephens briefly travelled to Ireland to establish the new American organisation\u2019s counterpart (initially nameless, it became the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, and was later known as the Irish Republican Brotherhood [IRB]) before setting sail for New York.[CITATION-25] The failure of the Fenian uprising against British forces in Canada in 1866, and the division of the organisation between O\u2019Mahony\u2019s faction and those of his rivals, spurred the IRB to withdraw its support for the Fenian Brotherhood, which dissolved in 1880. Taking its place in America were two Fenian or Irish-American republican organisations, the Clan na Gael and Jeremiah O\u2019Donovan Rossa\u2019s (1831\u20131915) United Irishmen (otherwise known as the \u2018Skirmishers\u2019).[CITATION-26] Although national issues stood at the centre of the Fenian cause, the Fenians were working and thinking in a much larger geographic space than Ireland or the Irish-American Atlantic, or even the British Empire alone. Indeed, \u2018[d]espite the centrality of an Atlantic triangulation between Ireland, Britain and the USA, Fenianism nonetheless extended in other directions\u2019, its networks stretching to Central and South America, continental Europe, South Africa, and also to Australia, to which many Irish political prisoners were transported. The concerns of some members were sometimes global in scope, certainly extending to Britain\u2019s empire in the East.[CITATION-27] In Indian history, 1848 stands out as the year of the Siege of Multan, which terrorised the expatriate British population.[CITATION-28] However, its role in the development of the institutions and mentalit\u00e9s of the British Indian state was eclipsed by the much larger uprising that broke out barely a decade later: the Indian Rebellion of 1857\u20138. Though no longer seen as the watershed it once was, the Rebellion nonetheless stands as an event that hastened the racialising and gendering of imperial rule and hardened not only the boundary between coloniser and colonised, but also the former\u2019s exploitation of the fault lines between confessional groups to ossify communal divisions on the subcontinent (notably, between Hindus and Muslims).[CITATION-29] Jill Bender\u2019s compelling analysis makes clear that the rebellion represented more than a crisis of the existing British government of India, for it became an imperial crisis, a harbinger of uprisings elsewhere in the empire, if not the wellspring of hope and optimism spawning the revolt of other colonised people. Of immediate concern to contemporaries, therefore, was the reportage of Indian events by the press in the colonies, particularly Ireland.[CITATION-30] Irish opinion on empire, as represented in the Irish press, neither reflected universal sympathy for the plight of other colonised peoples nor saw much necessary commonality between Ireland and India. This is borne out by Jennifer Regan\u2019s analysis of the Dublin-basedand; respectively, a Protestant-owned daily with a middle-class readership sympathetic to the Catholic Church and the Home Rule movement, and a weekly with roots in the Young Ireland movement that continued to espouse a fervent nationalist position even as its ownership changed hands.[CITATION-31] Whereas thereported the events of the 1857 Rebellion as retributive, akin to a popular uprising of the oppressed against tyranny such as the French Revolution, and a welcome setback to the British imperial project,was more hostile towards the mutiny in the East India Company\u2019s army (the spark of the popular uprising), not least because its readership was tied to the British Empire through trade and military service.[CITATION-32] Yet, the reporting of Indian events in the more radical (if not yet \u2018nationalist\u2019) Irish press, such as the, was a way of vilifying the Protestant British state and, by extension, threatening the integrity of the British Empire. If such papers were effective in dissuading Irishmen from enlisting, or in their critique of British activity in India, then the empire might slowly begin to crumble. The process might accelerate if such assessments intersected with seditious interests or with support from Britain\u2019s rivals on the Continent (namely, France) to precipitate Irish insurrection.[CITATION-33] If concerns to this effect were mooted in some quarters, they were not taken especially seriously by the British authorities.[CITATION-34] More worrying was the prospect of rebellion spreading to British shores from other colonies, such fears highlighted by the rebellion in Jamaica in 1865. Meanwhile, Sir Hugh Rose, a hero of the British army during the Indian Rebellion, was appointed commander-in-chief of the forces in Ireland, a post he held from his appointment in 1865 until his retirement in 1870.[CITATION-35] The emergence of transnational Fenianism after 1848, and the appearance in the 1860s of Fenian \u2018outrages\u2019 in Ireland, Britain and the distant corners of the empire\u2014Canada, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand\u2014intensified not only fears of an Irish uprising, but of a series of worldwide insurrections with the potential to cause the implosion of British imperialism.[CITATION-36] Rose was certainly concerned about Fenianism, particularly in the army: his career in India had brought home to him the risks when \u2018natives\u2019 were responsible for maintaining law and order over their brethren. Rose thus drew on ideas developed during his time in India; notably, the need for a strong military command responsive to the threat of dissent, harsh punishment of Fenianism (as treason, where it occurred in the military), and the use of courts martial as means of stamping out the earliest signs of mutiny and Fenian insurrection.[CITATION-37] In numerous ways, therefore, the fate of Ireland and of India became ever more closely entwined from the mid-century, not least in the anti-imperial proclamations of Irish patriots, and in British officialdom\u2019s fear of such sentiments contributing to the fomenting of an anti-imperial revolution.[CITATION-38] Focusing on the Fenian press and the writings of the Fenian command, the following three sections of this article examine how Irish-Americans\u2014from their vantage point outside both Ireland and the British Empire\u2014understood this relationship and its possibilities for Ireland\u2019s future. Fundamental to this endeavour is the New York-based weekly, the, in print from 1870 and in 1878 renamed theto reflect its reportage of matters at \u2018Home\u2019 in Ireland and those of interest to its readership of Irish-American blue-collar labourers.[CITATION-39] Irish-American weeklies were the product of the uprising of 1848: in its failure, it had thrown literate and political men with journalistic experience into Irish-American society. Here they produced \u2018a new kind of newspaper\u2019, far less deferential to the Church and marked by a radical republicanism.[CITATION-40] \u2019s ambition was to provide an interpretative digest of news from Ireland (and from other parts of the world as they pertained to the Irish cause), while also keeping readers abreast of American developments, and it was thus suited to being published weekly rather than daily.[CITATION-41] It was typical of this first generation of Irish-American republican periodicals, which were joined in the latter part of the century by a fresh wave of Irish-American newspapers; typical was the(established in 1882 as), whose editorial outlook was anti-British and pro-American, anti-imperialist yet \u2018Europeanist\u2019 (in reflection of Chicago\u2019s diverse population).[CITATION-42] Ignored by historians of Ireland and Irish America,has recently been examined by two scholars. First, Whelehan\u2019s study reveals the variety of concerns that animated Fenianism as it evolved until, by the late 1870s, some Fenians had embraced and appropriated the new technology of dynamite to the furtherance of the revolutionary cause, culminating between 1881 and 1885 in bombings in prominent public places in Britain, a campaign known as the \u2018dynamite outrages\u2019.[CITATION-43] Secondly, \u00dana N\u00ed Bhroim\u00e9il, in a chapter on cartoons appearing inin the early twentieth century, has highlighted their content, large size and central placement (on the letterhead on the front page) as a means of \u2018condensing the central editorial opinion into a front-page graphic\u2019, which was the essence of the New Journalism style exemplified by this periodical.[CITATION-44] attained a wide circulation across North America, Ireland and even Great Britain, reaching 20,000 copies in Ireland alone by 1880.[CITATION-45] It endeavoured to reflect proletarian concerns, even though its readership was not exclusively proletarian. In its critique of capitalist \u2018fat cats\u2019, its contents\u2014including the prominent cartoons on its front pages\u2014were frequently and unashamedly antisemitic, whether by \u2018unmasking\u2019 the \u2018Shylock\u2019 manipulating the Democrat and Republican parties alike, by showing \u2018King Shylock\u2019 being paid tribute by American industry, or by representing the premiership of Benjamin Disraeli as \u2018Shylock in Office\u2019, to take but a few graphic examples.[CITATION-46] Given the British and French Rothschilds\u2019 prominence in the financing of the Ottoman debt, it is no surprise that\u2019s contributors portrayed the Eastern Crisis as a Jewish capitalist plot.[CITATION-47] Yet this eruption of conflict in the Ottoman world in 1875 was also an opportunity for Ireland, as we will see in the following section.Ireland, plundered and enchained by the Turk of Western Europe, hails their [the Ottomans\u2019] effort with joy. The powers which have allowed the Turk to encamp in Europe and behave as he has behaved, merit contempt and scorn. These same governments shall themselves be torn to pieces with \u2018teeth of iron\u2019 in the coming revolution that will punish all their crimes against Truth, Justice and Liberty.[CITATION-48] The growth and acceleration of circulation stimulated the rise of transnational Irish republican networks. It spread news about assaults on British rule around the globe that had the potential to dent imperial prestige. And it encouraged fears that malcontents would be emboldened to overthrow empire at home and abroad. In fact, Irish republicans were more ambitious still, aware of the spaces between empires where rivalries could be exploited to their advantage. If the possibility of French support once nourished Irish republicanism, attention from the middle of the century shifted in the direction of Russia, whose empire straddled British imperial interests in the Near East and Asia. The dust had barely settled on the new post-Rebellion government in British India, for example, when the Irish newspaperexpressed hope in 1859 for an Anglo-Russian war in Asia.[CITATION-49] Across the Atlantic, members of the Clan na Gael\u2014under the leadership of John Devoy (1842\u20131928), veteran of the 1867 Irish uprising\u2014watched carefully the intensification of Britain\u2019s rivalry with Russia. War in Crimea (1853\u20136) resulted in Russia\u2019s defeat by Britain, France and the Ottomans, but also in its \u2018swing to the east\u2019, for the frustration of the attempt at empire-building on Russia\u2019s European borders was soon followed by its rapid annexation of territory south of the Kazakh steppe in Central Asia between 1864 and 1868.[CITATION-50] Castigated on other pages ofin the later 1870s for its aggressions in the Balkans, the Ottoman Empire served as a mirror in which the Christian powers might see their own reflection, as the article excerpted from above shows. Just as the Ottomans had historically vanquished and subjugated the peoples of southern Europe, so, too\u2014as\u2019s contributors remarked here and elsewhere\u2014was England an imperial \u2018robber power\u2019.[CITATION-51] According to the Book of Daniel invoked in this passage, it was from the \u2018Great Sea\u2019 that four beasts would emerge. The fourth and most terrible of these, with its \u2018teeth of iron\u2019, would nonetheless be put to death, thus ending the empires of these king-beasts to usher in a new and more righteous age. In this apocalyptic Biblical allusion, the four beasts were the Great Powers self-interestedly vying for control of the Mediterranean (the Great Sea), of which the fourth and most awful was, of course, England. The uprisings in the Balkan principalities against Ottoman rule in 1875 had provided the pretext for Russia\u2019s intervention in southern Europe, as defender of the Orthodox Church. This, in turn, threatened Britain\u2019s empire in Asia; such possibilities underwrote Britain\u2019s strategic alliance with the Sublime Porte to counterbalance Tsarist expansionism in the eastern Mediterranean and around the Black Sea.[CITATION-52] Great Power rivalries and interests thus precipitated the Great Eastern Crisis of 1875\u20138, but also\u2014as this author forprophesised\u2014the roiling of European imperialism toward its self-destruction and the popular revolution that would finally bring emancipation to the masses.Russia\u2019s slow creep toward the frontiers of Britain\u2019s empire on the Indian subcontinent aroused fears of Romanov designs\u2014possibly in alliance with Afghanistan\u2014for the invasion of British India. Such nervousness remained largely latent through the second half of the nineteenth century but peaked whenever even the slightest of rumours gained purchase in official or wider expatriate circles, usually through frenzy whipped up by the press.[CITATION-53] Since\u2019s correspondents kept tabs on Fleet Street\u2019s sensationalist outpourings, British anxieties were transformed in its pages into opportunities for the Irish cause. The eruption of the Great Eastern Crisis brought the prospect of a multi-fronted assault on British imperialism, should Russia prove willing to press Britain in Asia. \u2018To India via Constantinople.\u2019[CITATION-54] This was the hope (or fantasy) expressed by: a Russian victory in Europe that would oust British imperialism from Asia, thus furthering plans to evict the English from Ireland.On the front page of the 28 October 1876 issue ofappeared a cartoon captioned \u2018\u201cThe Last Scene of All.\u201d A vision of John Bull\u2019s Departure from India to be Enacted in the Last Scene, in the Great Drama Entitled \u201cThe Irrepressible Conflict Between England and Russia\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-55] One way or another, most likely as a result of victory in the current war, the way would be paved for Russia\u2019s continued march eastward, Britain purportedly standing little chance of resisting the Russian conquest of India. Even if the other European powers were to assert the need for a \u2018balance of power\u2019, forcing Russia to return India to Britain, this would necessarily result in \u2018concessions\u2019 to the Tsar in Europe that would weaken British power in the West.[CITATION-56] The language of \u2018outrages\u2019\u2014by this time so commonly used to describe the criminality and barbarous actions of the rural Irish that it had become a synonym for the Irish problem\u2014was flipped in \u2018England\u2019s Difficulty\u2019, a piece appearing in the paper in 1876.[CITATION-57] Its author discussed \u2018British outrages\u2019 in Ireland before tackling \u2018Irish interests\u2019 to be had in consequence of Russia making territorial gains and weakening British hegemony in the global political system.[CITATION-58] For all the optimism about the chain of events Russian expansion might unleash, it should be noted that the Fenian press was neither blind to the stultifying effect upon ordinary Russians of Tsarist autocracy (and, thus, to the prospect of popular revolution), nor unmindful of the Romanov state as another callous imperial power that would not hesitate to \u2018wipe them [the Turks] out altogether\u2019 in pursuit of domination.[CITATION-59] \u2018The progress of the Eastern war is all that Irishmen could desire.\u2019[CITATION-60] Typical of sentiments expressed inuntil the end of war in 1878, such statements said little about the practical steps necessary to harness the opportunity for Ireland at hand.[CITATION-61] A degree of behind-the-scenes pragmatism was evident within the Fenian command, however. In a letter to John Devoy in February 1876, a Fenian revolutionary, Dr William Carroll, stated that it was the Clan na Gael\u2019s \u2018business to be ready\u2019 for such \u2018emergency\u2019.[CITATION-62] Indians possessed a lower standard of intelligence than the Irish, Carroll argued, and so would be even more helpless if Britain employed divide-and-rule tactics to disarm rebellion, for such strategy had long maintained English rule in Ireland. If Russia were to show her hand, the opportunities for successful insurrection in British India might be greater.[CITATION-63] Carroll wrote with greater optimism of the intensification of revolutionary feeling, and of the hope of driving England to war with Russia, for if Russia were to \u2018go to Hindostan [], it will soon be all over with the newly made \u201cEmpress\u201d of that unfortunate Empire\u2019.[CITATION-64] Thus was hatched a plan to meet with \u2018the Russian Ambassador at Washington, to whom we will present a well-digested Memorial on the discontent in Ireland, her capacity for war, her eagerness for it, etc\u2019.[CITATION-65] The Fenians were enmeshing the Irish cause with the contest in Asia played between Great Britain and Russia, the cold war of rumours and proxy conflicts that Rudyard Kipling termed the \u2018Great Game\u2019.With the end of the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, Fenian interest shifted from the implosive potential of rivalry among the imperial powers to the insurrectionary potential along the edges and in the \u2018buffer-zones\u2019 of the British Empire.[CITATION-66] \u2018England\u2019s extremity is Ireland\u2019s opportunity\u2019,proclaimed. \u2018Extremity\u2019 here referred to the British Empire both as a spatial entity and as an ongoing temporal process. \u2018Ireland\u2019s freedom may be achieved on fields far from her shores\u2019, for it was on the imperial fringe that an imperial crisis was most likely to foment\u2014\u2018Who knows but that the battle may be fought out in the East?\u2019 On the other hand, British expansion was self-propelling even as this served to undermine imperial integrity:England will find her Indian empire a mill stone hung to her neck. To retain what she holds she must continually try to clutch more territory. \u2026 All the world [will begin] to bristle with enemies of England, and English policy\u2014guided by a fatal necessity\u2014heaps up wrath against the day of reckoning.[CITATION-67] More broadly, by drawing the connection between British rule in Ireland and British atrocities and injustices elsewhere in the empire, correspondents forand other Irish newspapers forwarded the notion, Whelehan argues, of \u2018imperialism as an extension of landlordism, as the international expression of robber elites taking land from its rightful owners, the \u201ctoilers of the soil\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-68] In this way, Paul Townend shows, they were able to fashion an anti-imperialism that undergirded and gave popular appeal to the Land League and the Irish Parliamentary Party.[CITATION-69] India had been integral to the development of the Irish nationalist-republican critique of colonialism from the middle of the century. It was to India, particularly the volatile north-west frontier of the Indian Empire, that attention turned during the Great Eastern Crisis, and it was here\u2014albeit only for another two years\u2014that attention remained fixed as the Fenians eagerly awaited the beginnings of the climacteric enabling Ireland to cast off the English yoke. By reporting on the Indian famines of the 1870s,journalists condemned British policy to a sympathetic audience, since a large part of the paper\u2019s readership in America was drawn from those, or the progeny of those, who had left Ireland during the Great Famine of 1845\u20139.[CITATION-70] By 1878, Indian distress and disaffection with the colonial government\u2019s Malthusian response to food scarcity was presented as \u2018kindling\u2019 for some uprising of \u2018our two hundred and fifty millions of subjects\u2019, with a possible spark coming from the Amir of Afghanistan, Sher Ali (r. 1863\u201379), \u2018organising a large armyfrom our Viceroy in India\u2019.[CITATION-71] In September 1878, the Amir turned away an approaching British embassy, having earlier received a diplomatic mission sent by the Tsar. In November 1878, therefore, amid mounting tensions and uncertainty about the exact nature of the Afghan court\u2019s relations with Russia, Britain declared war on Afghanistan, a conflict which lasted until September 1880.Fenian leaders continued to toy with the idea of exploiting imperial rivalries to abrade and exhaust British power where it was most vulnerable, on the empire\u2019s frontiers and along its borders.[CITATION-72] When rumour came of unrest in Afghanistan in late 1877, there was hope that it might spill into \u2018action against the common enemy\u2019. Were the Fenians to have \u2018a man there who could assure them, in, of finding in us allies and friends\u2019, General F.F. Millen of the Fenian military command wrote to Carroll, \u2018the result, irrespective of the power of Russia, would be to hasten their action and bring matters to a crisis\u2019.[CITATION-73] When news reached America of Sher Ali\u2019s dismissal of the British embassy in 1878, the Fenian command was already poised to ponder its potential for the larger Irish struggle. Over a decade after the failure of the 1866 raids into Canada, Carroll wrote to Devoy in October 1878 of disaffection in Britain\u2019s North American colony, stating that if it were great enough \u2018among the Irish and French we could break up their whole Government\u2019. He added that if \u2018Sheer Ali and his friend the Czar co-operated at the other end of \u201cHer Majesty\u2019s Empire\u201d\u2019, the whole enterprise might meet with more success, and thus reiterated the value of meeting with the Russian ambassador in Washington.[CITATION-74] This optimism within the Fenian command was matched by sentiments articulated in the Fenian press.\u2018Trans-Atlantic\u2019 was the author of a column exploring Irish and global affairs pertaining to the Irish cause, matters frequently of such political importance towards the end of the 1870s as to make the front page of. \u2018Trans-Atlantic\u2019 was the pseudonym of Thomas J. Mooney, the paper\u2019s European correspondent and a veteran of the 1848 uprising.[CITATION-75] He and other columnists regularly reported on Afghanistan throughout the course of the war. In the month prior to the commencement of fighting, Trans-Atlantic wrote that the \u2018savage king\u2019 had \u2018scornfully rejected\u2019 Britain\u2019s offer of friendship\u2014the reporting more likely conveying a lack of sympathy for Afghanistan\u2019s political position (or, at least, the portrayal of it in the British press) than reflecting a deliberately and archly sarcastic tone (in light of the tenor and content of the remainder of the column). The problem was that Afghanistan was a buffer zone separating \u2018our Eastern Empire from the Empire of Russia\u2019. Thus, \u2018we can\u2019t stand this\u2019: \u2018Our flag of supremacy must be upheld in the East or we go down, down, down!\u2019[CITATION-76] Following the start of the war, however, Trans-Atlantic\u2019s position reversed, becoming more critical of British policy and more sympathetic toward Afghanistan. Recognising that details of the progress of the British campaigns were drawn from the British press, Trans-Atlantic stated explicitly in October 1879 that such sources had to be scrutinised and read critically, in January 1880 going as far as to say that the press had been withholding information from the British public and that fighting the Afghans was, in fact, contributing greatly to the \u2018crumbling down of the great British Empire at abroad and at home\u2019.[CITATION-77] Relaying \u2018news\u2019 published inat the outbreak of the war of Russian-trained soldiers being allowed to enlist in the army of Sher Ali, Trans-Atlantic jeered: \u2018What do you think of that, ye Gentleman of England now sitting at home at ease?\u2019[CITATION-78] At the same time, because Afghanistan was a buffer zone,noted that Russia possessed interests in exercising toward the Amir \u2018that kind of \u201cbenevolent neutrality\u201d England practiced during the Turco-Russian war\u2019; that is, to \u2018furnish them [the Afghans] with anything he may need, from a cartridge to a Krupp gun, and \u2026 see that his troops make proper use of them\u2019.[CITATION-79] For their part, Asians were viewed as pawns, the Fenians sympathising with their plight while considering them inferior and valuable only in so far as they could help precipitate the crumbling of British imperialism.[CITATION-80] Although the weaker political positions of the Zulus and Afghans were said to stem from their only having recently started their struggle against English imperialism, which the Irish themselves had been fighting for centuries, this ought not to obscure the use of such terms as \u2018savages\u2019 to describe African and Asian colonised peoples, and thus the seeping into the \u2018sympathetic\u2019 prose and worldview of the Irish-American republicans of the very sorts of racial difference and hierarchy that had historically led to Ireland\u2019s own oppression.[CITATION-81] Ultimately, the Afghan war was significant because of its potential for precipitating Britain\u2019s reversal of fortune. \u2018The Afghan Uprising\u2019 represented \u2018A Fearful Blow to British Power in Asia\u2019, not only because Britain had met her match, but because the war effort necessitated the withdrawal of British troops from Burma, much to the satisfaction of the Burmese court, which had been holding fast in the face of two defeats to the British (1824\u20136, 1852\u20133), and because of speculation concerning Russian intervention if the tide turned against Britain.[CITATION-82] The war was \u2018Driving Out the Robber Invader\u2019 and heralded as \u2018A Repetition of the Tragedy of 1842\u2019\u2014that is, the retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839\u201342) that had resulted in thousands of British and Indian casualties.[CITATION-83] The expansionism of the era of the New Imperialism had overstretched Britain, so that the emergence of simultaneous colonial conflicts increased not only the chance of defeat, but of the implosion of the empire itself. \u2018Taking into account that [during the Irish Rebellion] in 1798 it took the whole force of the British Empire and one hundred and seventy thousand troops to put down the patriots of only one and a half Irish counties\u2019, Trans-Atlantic mused, \u2018where will they get troops to put down twenty countries?\u2019[CITATION-84] Thus, Trans-Atlantic noted, the \u2018uprising in Cabul [] is a continuation of the Zulu uprising in South Africa\u2014a part,, of the great breaking up, at least, of the wickedest Government of men that ever scourged the inhabitants of the earth\u2019.[CITATION-85] Trans-Atlantic regularly offered readers a panorama of imperial conflicts to make the case that the \u2018British Empire is Tottering\u2019, having by 1880 faced \u2018Four Defeats in As Many Years\u2019. At the same time, he stressed the immorality of British rule, calling the British Empire \u2018a Confederation of Robbers\u2019.[CITATION-86] Trans-Atlantic\u2019s column of 10 May 1879, for instance, reported on the underhandedness of the British during the war with Afghanistan (where during night raids they \u2018shoot the Afghans at sight, and make prisoners only of their cattle\u2019); the preparations made by the Burmese court amid rising hostilities (which would erupt in 1885 into the Third Anglo-Burmese War); the unprecedented humiliation Britain faced at the hands of the Zulus; as well as the trouble potentially posed by the French in Africa and the threat of political independence emanating from the \u2018faithful, peaceful dominion\u2019 of Canada.[CITATION-87] The cover story of 22 March 1879 was headlined \u2018Cheers for the Zulus!\u2019, and gave instructions on \u2018How the Workers for Ireland\u2019s Independence Ought to Feel Towards Cetywayo\u2019. Positively, was the answer, for the Zulu king and leader of the Zulu war against the British was \u2018worth [to the Irish cause] three hundred and seventy-five Home Rule members of Parliament\u2019.[CITATION-88] Reporting on the Anglo-Afghan War and these other conflicts was thus a form of counter-propaganda to what was found in the British press, at the same time helping to keep the flame of the Fenian cause burning in America by rousing optimism and raising resources for the Irish struggle, portrayed as an anti-imperial struggle. In the years following the conclusion of the Afghan conflict,moved on to discuss such events as the revolt led by Colonel \u2018Urabi against the Egyptian dynastic ruler and his British overlords (1879\u201382), the outbreak of the Mahdist War against Egypt (and, later, Britain) in 1881, and the Boer War (1880\u201381), as well as the advent of British informal imperialism in Afghanistan following the signing of the Treaty of Gandamak in 1879, by which Afghanistan ceded foreign policy control to Britain in return for regular subsidy payments.[CITATION-89] The year 1879, Townend notes, marked a critical juncture in the development of Irish nationalism and its associated press: a time when troubles looming on the Irish horizon\u2014including another famine and the resumption of the land wars\u2014coincided with troubles in the empire, presenting at once crisis and opportunity.[CITATION-90] continued its prominent coverage of imperial conflicts into the 1880s, as shown by expressions of camaraderie with \u2018Urabi and sympathy for the Egyptian rebels.[CITATION-91] The leading story on 19 August 1882, for instance, juxtaposed \u2018no mercy for Ireland\u2019 with the \u2018300,000 Souls Sacrificed to British Mammon\u2019 in Alexandria during the \u2018Great Egyptian Murder\u2019.[CITATION-92] After 1879, however, landlordism and anti-rent struggles took more and more column inches, eclipsing stories from far-flung locales. By 1881, Trans-Atlantic\u2019s juxtaposition of Irish problems with contemporaneous troubles in other British colonies as a means of animating an anti-imperial stance was largely displaced by a weekly column that sought to draw lessons for Ireland from its own history. In 1882\u20133, Trans-Atlantic examined the \u2018Land Wars\u2019 being fought by peoples other than the Irish, drawing into the comparative frame with Ireland territories within but also outside the British Empire, including the Ottoman domains.In this way, comparisons of various sorts\u2014historical and spatial\u2014remained a part of Trans-Atlantic\u2019s polemic and part of a discursive construction of Irish anti-imperialism, even as interest in Africa or Asia dissipated. Yet this rhetorical project produced, perhaps necessarily, a demand for substantive action, for reporting on the progress of colonial conflicts and drawing parallels with the situation in Ireland presented other colonial peoples as comrades-in-arms deserving assistance, especially if their struggle would help accelerate Irish emancipation.[CITATION-93] noted with dismay during the Great Eastern Crisis that more money had been raised by the \u2018venal\u2019 English aristocracy for the Turks than the Skirmishing Fund had raised for its causes.[CITATION-94] That support might be proffered to colonial peoples fighting the British was eventually mooted by certain members of the Fenian command during the Zulu and Afghan Wars. It could involve the despatch of manpower and placing part of the Skirmishing Funds at the disposal of the Afghans or deploying it in support of Egyptian, Sudanese or Boer fighters. These proposals ultimately came to nought but were discussed widely enough to be derided in the American press. Frederick B. Opper\u2019s cartoon inin 1882\u2014\u2018\u201d\u2019\u2014showed impressionable immigrants queuing to donate their dollars to the Skirmishing Fund, a rallying poster declaring \u2018The British Lion to be chained for 1000 years!!! Money wanted for the chains!!!\u2019 Another cartoon outlines the trustees\u2019 statement of expenditures, including \u2018Cash for Arabi [] (lost)\u2019, mocking the efforts by some Fenians to support Colonel \u2018Urabi, and suggesting the money was squandered by unscrupulous Fenian political leaders.[CITATION-95] One significant feature of Afghanistan, Egypt, Sudan and southern Africa is their location as fringes, if not frontiers, of Britain\u2019s formal empire; another is the part played by Muslim societies as opponents of British imperialism in these locales. Over the long nineteenth century, the response of Muslims to the intrusion of the European imperial powers could hardly be described as passive, for revivalist movements stressing a return to \u2018true\u2019 Islam were often accompanied by armed resistance to infidel colonial authority, such as the Diponegoro Revolt in Dutch Java between 1825 and 1830, the Mahdist War in Sudan waged against the forces of the British Empire and her Egyptian protectorate in the closing decades of the century, the Qadiri brotherhood\u2019sagainst French colonial troops in Algeria in the 1830s and 1840s, or the Sanusi brotherhood\u2019s resistance to Italian occupation in north Africa in the early twentieth century.[CITATION-96] Originating in eighteenth-century Arabia in the writings and teachings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703\u201396), the Wahhabis are the best known of the revivalists, and Wahhabism became a watchword for the fear of Muslim agency across the colonial world, even as its connection to the general pattern of revivalism and resistance in Muslim societies was in many cases more complex.[CITATION-97] It was believed by contemporaries that Muslims were well placed to take advantage of weaknesses in the global system. For instance, Winston Churchill, who observed the British forces fighting in Malakand during the 1897 uprising on the Northwest Frontier, identified \u2018external events\u2019, such as Turkish victory over Greek forces, that \u2018united to produce a \u201cboom\u201d in Mohammedanism\u2019 that local religious leaders quickly exploited.[CITATION-98] There now exists a large and growing historical interest in the articulation by Muslim thinkers of Islam\u2019s revolutionary potential; the reception of these ideas in Muslim societies across the transnational and increasingly interconnected(Islamic community); and the reactions\u2014including the emotional responses, such as anxiety or panic\u2014of the European powers.[CITATION-99] What perhaps remains more obscure is the engagement with these ideas by colonised peoplesthe Muslim world. What is significant about the reportage in the Irish and Fenian press of events from Egypt to Afghanistan, therefore, is its acknowledgement of Islam\u2019s political potential in the anti-colonial struggle that was being fought in the white dominions, such as Ireland.\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve issue of 1881 included a cartoon showing Father Time introducing Mr Punch to the latest in a series of imperial problems, each personified as a waxwork: 1881 was represented by the figure of an Irishman\u2014for the Fenian dynamite campaign had commenced\u2014behind whom were situated the \u2018Asiatic\u2019 and \u2018African\u2019 problems of previous years.[CITATION-100] Such connections were sometimes made more explicitly, not least with the coinage of the term \u2018Fenian-Pest\u2019 by\u2019s illustrator, John Tenniel. It played on the outbreak of Rinderpest attacking English livestock at the same time as the burst of Fenian activities around 1865, serving as a metaphor for threats to the empire both at \u2018home\u2019 and \u2018from within\u2019, and for the nervousness that Fenian success might inspire \u2018contagion\u2019 across the imperial world.[CITATION-101] In fact, as we have seen, the Fenians pined for the reverse by the late 1870s; namely, a conflict in the colonies that would consume the British Empire. This idea was articulated not only in the Irish-American weekly,, but also parts of the Irish press, such as the, whose coverage of the Mahdist War suggested the following:If the Crescent should shine out victoriously in one part of the world, it may run riot in other quarters. Let the Mahomedan revolt in India, and the disaffected Hindoos may be caught by the contagion.[CITATION-102] The growth of British imperial power across Asia and Africa over the nineteenth century had faced some of its fiercest resistance from Islamic societies. The spectre of Wahhabism\u2014which challenged the authority both of infidel rulers, such as the British, and improper or impious Muslim leaders, such as the Ottoman sultans\u2014caused colonial administrators extreme anxiety, so virulent was this movement held to be, and so transmittable was its contamination.[CITATION-103] The British imperial state\u2019s anxiety about contagion effects\u2014specifically, the linking of the Irish (diaspora) and their cause with Muslim resistance\u2014was, within this context, not entirely outlandish. The assassination of Lord Mayo by a Pashtun tribesman from Afghanistan was widely feared to be part of a larger Islamic conspiracy or Wahhabist plot, although the final inquiry decided that the assassin, Sher Ali Afridi, was acting alone and possibly in reprisal against an alien system that had incarcerated him.[CITATION-104] Richard Southwell Bourke (1822\u201372), the sixth earl of Mayo, was a major Irish landlord who served as Chief Secretary of Ireland three times, before being appointed Viceroy of India in 1869. It was in this capacity that he toured the penal colony at Port Blair on the Andaman Islands, where he was fatally stabbed in 1872, the incident naturally receiving considerable coverage in the Irish press.Some of the immediate reportage was relatively balanced.[CITATION-105] Yet much of the reaction played on the Orientalist imagery of the bloodthirsty Muslim tribesman from the Northwest Frontier, tropes then holding much currency in the imperial domain.[CITATION-106] Generally, notwithstanding sympathy on the part of some Irish nationalists, the fear of Indian Muslims reached fever pitch following the 1857 uprising, the memory and memorialisation of which renewed mistrust down generations of colonial administration and expatriate society. The Indo-Afghan frontier and its inhabitants acquired a particular notoriety after the First Anglo-Afghan War, in large part due to the carnage during the retreat from Kabul in 1842. The conclusion of the Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1848 extended British government to the frontier, and British rulers and administrators faced the same difficulty as their Mughal, Afghan and Sikh forebears in bringing the independent Pashtun tribes\u2014especially the Yusufzai who inhabited the area around the Khyber Pass\u2014under their centralised authority.[CITATION-107] Some of the Yusufzais\u2019 actions were taken at the initiative of the leader of a colony (described in British Indian government sources as a \u2018fanatical colony\u2019) at a place named Sitana (ditto: \u2018Sitana fanatics\u2019) of Indian Muslims (\u2018Hindustani fanatics\u2019). They had relocated from the Ganges valley around 1824, which had by then been under British rule for several decades, and from whence they departed so that they might renew their faith.[CITATION-108] The Sitana colonists/fanatics, making common cause with the Yusufzai rank and file, wagedagainst the British. The British response to this and other tribal resistance was generally brutal and violent, from punitive measures (such as blockades) to pacification campaigns. The Ambela campaign of 1863 led to the disintegration and dispersal of the colony for several decades, but was also the catalyst for the crackdown on the so-called Hindustani fanatics\u2019 supporters and collaborators in north India, a result of which was the so-called Wahhabi trials of 1865\u201371.[CITATION-109] Such fears of the enemy within the British Indian heartland were both crystallised and whipped up by W.W. Hunter\u2019s tract denouncing Islamic revivalism,(1871). By characterising the colonists as Wahhabi conspirators\u2014secret, seditious and fanatical\u2014Hunter linked their activities to extra-Indian movements of Islamic revival and renewal taking place within the larger \u2018Islamic intellectual universe\u2019, as Benjamin Hopkins and Magnus Marsden have argued.[CITATION-110] By the 1880s, a new environment more critical of Hunter\u2019s work was evident, but such fears and the associated discourse about fanatics formed a hardy trope that had diffused widely across the empire and regularly reappeared in the context of skirmishes on the Northwest Frontier, or confrontations with the \u2018mads\u2019 of the Somaliland and the \u2018militants\u2019 in Sudan.[CITATION-111] \u2018Long life to the Wahabees []\u2019, declared the\u2014duly relayed in the British press\u2014in response to news of Muslims placed on trial in British India on charges of assisting a Wahhabi plot in 1871, the year prior to Lord Mayo\u2019s assassination.[CITATION-112] Knowledge of Wahhabism and its radical political potential thus circulated widely, enabling the drawing together not only of Islamic and Irish personages and events, but of their respective futurities. Robert Sterndale\u2019s novel(1879), for example, featured a Muslim(a practitioner of indigenous medicine) called Sheikh Rehmat-Ullah. \u2018To call a man a Wahabi [] is to nine-tenths of Englishmen in India to call him a fanatic and a rebel, a sort of Mahomedan Fenian, one whom the police should take under special surveillance, whose every action is open to suspicion\u2019. It was to this \u2018treasonable sect\u2019 that Rehmat-Ullah belonged as a Muslim (even as a plainsman, rather than a frontiersman).[CITATION-113] Elizabeth Kolsky notes the absurdity of such characterisation: one cannot at once be both a Muslim and an Irish Catholic. She argues, however, that this construction worked because \u2018in an imperial context, [it] represent[ed] the fear some colonial officials had that a \u201cFenian Fever\u201d would sweep out across the British Empire, inspiring rebels from diverse locales to resist violently\u2019.[CITATION-114] The political potential of a concoction of Fenianism and the anti-colonialism of the global Muslim community was not entirely phantasmagorical, the product of sensationalist Victorian writers. It was a sense of common cause and connection articulated by the Fenians themselves that enabled their elision, as evinced by two of Trans-Atlantic\u2019s columns from 1878, one bearing the subtitle \u2018Indian Fenians\u2019, the other \u2018Fenianism in India\u2019.[CITATION-115] The former reported Indian disaffection with Lord Lytton\u2019s viceroyalty (1876\u201380). Lytton\u2019s Indian Arms Act of 1878 entailed \u2018the entire disarmament of our Indian subjects ()\u2019, Trans-Atlantic noted, in this phrasing drawing connections with legislation passed in 1843 restricting the possession of arms by Irish Catholics. Thus, Indians became Fenians by parallel legislative experience, but also because the existence of an underground manufacturing powder and bullets to supply Indian subjects would combine with \u2018Ireland\u2019s waking up\u2019 to culminate in \u2018a terrible awakening \u2026 to the oppressor\u2019.[CITATION-116] The second article concerned the Vernacular Press Act of the same year, which was the government\u2019s response to criticism found in Indian newspapers both of individual colonial administrators and of the administration in general through the 1870s. Lytton\u2019s muzzling of the press drew its inspiration from the Peace Preservation (Ireland) Act of 1870, which, S.B. Cook observes, armed \u2018Lytton with a blueprint for proceeding against seditious papers with a minimum of legal fuss, a certainty of conviction and the universal imposition ofcensorship\u2019.[CITATION-117] But, whereas the Irish act was \u2018a piece of emergency legislation with a specific target and a fixed life, Lytton\u2019s Act was permanent\u2019.[CITATION-118] Again, Trans-Atlantic sympathised in furtherance of the Irish cause, holding that Indian \u2018newspapers breathe nothing so frequent as \u201csedition\u201d and \u201cdisloyalty\u201d towards \u201cour\u201d Empire and \u201cour\u201d Governor\u2019. Yet \u2018looking over the passages extracted for prosecution, that they were all edited by a member of the Irish Skirmishing Fund, so identically do their complaints and their proposed cure () coincide\u2019.[CITATION-119] In other words, Indians might not be raising the standard of insurrection, having tried and failed in 1857 much as the Irish had in 1848. But they were articulating an \u2018anti-imperial\u2019 or \u2018republican\u2019 position of sorts; thus, Fenianism was alive in India.Clearly, then, the translocation of such categories as \u2018Fenian\u2019 to India was not only possible but apposite, at least in the eyes of some writers belonging to the Irish-American press.[CITATION-120] Where, if at all, did the Muslim frontiersman fit into this picture?reported in March 1879 not only on the difficulties of the British forces in Afghanistan, but also on a story circulating in the British press of the summary execution by five men of a \u2018fanatic\u2019 in Peshawar on the Indo-Afghan frontier. The latter was presented as proof of the worst aspects of English imperialism, which had given formal sanction to the killings of perpetrators of \u2018fanatical outrages\u2019 by frontier officers under the Murderous Outrages Act of 1867 (revised, 1877). This \u2018legitimate arbitrariness\u2019 undoubtedly resounded with the Irish, given the frequent imposition of Coercion Acts and the suspension of habeas corpus to deal with the \u2018praedial outrages\u2019 and other unrest.[CITATION-121] Irishmen might recognise from their own historical experience the twin power of language and legislation in producing oppressive British imperial rule, and thus do well to dismantle discursive categories to undermine the authority of imperial legislation in their own and other locales. In his war correspondence, Trans-Atlantic praised the bravery of \u2018heroic Ghazis, call them what you please\u2019. In so doing, he repurposed as a term of honour\u2014often translated as \u2018holy warrior\u2019\u2014from its usage within the imperial domain to signify enemies of Christendom. These Afghans, he noted, fought with \u2018naked swords and pikes, and even pointed staves\u2019 against \u2018trained soldiers, armed in the most scientific manner\u2019, suffering heavy casualties in consequence but persisting nonetheless.[CITATION-122] Trans-Atlantic worked the trope of the Afghan fanatic into something admirable, his honourable character an inspiration for Irish republicans. In 1879, he cited reports published in the British press that \u2018the districts of Herat, Badakshan [], and Balk [] have all revolted against the authority of the British Governors\u2019, adding (with emphasis) that \u2018, and fanatics are inciting the population of all the Afghan cities to take part in it\u2019. The \u2018murder\u2019 of Afghan priests by the English, he reported, \u2018left some brethren on the earth who have sworn that they shall be avenged on the invader, and this explains the \u201cfanatic\u201d hostility to the English all over that region of the earth\u2019. Trans-Atlantic thus challenged the use of \u2018fanatic\u2019 while rendering Afghan vengeance as just, something stirred up by British atrocity. To conclude, he brought the Irishman into this frame, raising the possibility that \u2018in view of certain anti-rent proceedings in Ireland, the English invaders in that country may resume the Cromwellian method of \u201csettling Ireland\u201d by hanging three or four Catholic priests\u2014just to \u201cstrike terror\u201d\u2019. This, he stated, would set the Irish \u2018on the warpath in earnest\u2019, except, he provoked, \u2018who would risk a drop of human blood to avenge the hanging of three or four Fenians?\u2019[CITATION-123] \u2018From the expatriate intellectual circles in London, Paris, Berlin, and San Francisco\u2019, writes Maia Ramnath, \u2018to Gandhi\u2019s early career to the passage of subcontinental natives throughout the realms mapped out by the Pan-Islamic Khilafat movement or the Communist International, much of the power of the [Indian] independence struggle was incubated outside the territory of British India\u2019.[CITATION-124] In fact, as these examples demonstrate, the terrain of the early anti-colonial independence movement was frequently transnational, trans-imperial or global in scope, not least because restrictions on the activities of Indians forced them underground or abroad, outside British India and the British Empire, where they forged solidarities with other movements and political formations. Headquartered in California, with interlocutors and leaders spread out in \u2018staging grounds\u2019 across Euro-America, the diasporic Ghadar (\u2018revolt\u2019 or \u2018mutiny\u2019) movement was a critically important example. Britain\u2019s declaration of war in 1914 provided the Ghadarites with an \u2018irresistible opportunity\u2019 to finally bring the empire to its knees and seek India\u2019s freedom, for \u2018its archenemy, Germany, was offering support to those with their own interest in undermining the strength of the empire, such as the Indian and Irish national revolutionists and pro-Ottoman Pan-Islamists\u2019.[CITATION-125] Instigated by the German Foreign Office in the autumn of 1914 and promoted by all levels of the diplomatic service, Germany\u2019s encouragement of the Ghadarites, the Indian and Irish nationalists and the Ottomans was part of a sweeping \u2018revolutionary subversion\u2019, its \u2018networks of cash, arms and intelligence and its mobilisation of political groups\u2019 truly global in scope.[CITATION-126] The policy was given a central prominence in Fritz Fischer\u2019s landmark analysis of Germany\u2019s wartime visions and strategies, but the theme has not been pursued over the last seventy years or so as scholars have preoccupied themselves with a narrower (often national) frame of analysis.[CITATION-127] Only now, in a new and self-consciously global age, are such entanglements as that of German interests with those of national minorities in Imperial Russia, of Muslims in the British and Russian empires, and of other anti-imperial groupings around the world, coming more completely to light. In a similar vein, this article has examined the anti-imperialism of the Irish-American diaspora, focusing on the entanglement of their initiatives with the perceived interests of (Muslim) societies on the periphery of the British Empire, as far away as Afghanistan and India, Sudan and Egypt. It has taken a framework of analysis that is trans-imperial and global in scope to accommodate and understand the far-reaching political universe of historical actors\u2014the Fenian command and Fenian journalists writing for\u2014who are usually viewed within the confines of nation and empire.The efforts of Imperial Germany and the Ghadarites were quashed but are nonetheless significant. They brought to fruition a strategy for national liberation along similar lines to the hopes of the Fenian exiles of almost four decades earlier, as expressed by John Devoy in a speech delivered in Massachusetts in 1881:Ireland\u2019s opportunity will come when England is engaged in a desperate struggle with some great European power or when the flame of insurrection has spread through her Indian Empire, and her strength and resources are strained.[CITATION-128] Indeed, much as the Fenians called for the deliverance of Ireland from British rulesuch colonies as India and Egypt, so, too, the goal of the Ghadarites was to free HindustanIreland, Egypt and China.[CITATION-129] Although the Fenians only mooted material support and manpower for those fighting wars against the colonial regime in Afghanistan and southern Africa, Egypt and Sudan up to about 1885, radical Indian nationalists were able not only to draw inspiration from the Irish nationalist example and fashion hardy solidarity with those fighting for the Irish cause, but also to secure material support from the radical Irish-American press (in the publication of their own periodicals) and the assistance of men such as John Devoy (in the establishment of their own organisations on American soil).[CITATION-130] If the Fenians took an interest in the potential of Islamic societies for launching a multi-fronted assault on the British Empire, and in exploiting Britain\u2019s rivalry with Russia as a means of abrading and exhausting British power, it was Imperial Germany which actually targeted Muslim (and Irish) soldiers during the Great War, attempting to turn their loyalties against Britain and thereby undermine British fighting power.[CITATION-131] If the British Empire was a Euro-Islamic condominium, Imperial Germany perceived in this a potentiality for subversion, allying with the Ottoman state to harness an opportunity to overthrow her British rival, thus reworking into a practical strategy the vision entertained by certain Fenians in the late nineteenth century.Ultimately, the opportunity presented by the awakening of an imperial crisis was one over which the Fenians could exert little control, and which faded in significance upon the commencement of the Land Wars in Ireland and the associated repression by the British state. In 1881, the Fenians began a campaign of placing explosives at the centre of British imperialism, London, and subsequently in the industrial and mercantile cities of Great Britain\u2014Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester\u2014where symbolic buildings were the targets of bomb attacks. On \u2018Dynamite Saturday\u2019 in January 1885, the skirmishing campaign reached a climax when homemade bombs exploded in the (empty) chamber of the House of Commons, the crypt of Westminster Hall and the armoury at the Tower of London, causing an international sensation, and garnering attention for Irish grievances.[CITATION-132] These \u2018Fenian outrages\u2019 or \u2018dynamite outrages\u2019 were perpetrated by \u2018teams of bombers whose leadership, finance, and most of whose personnel came from \u2026 O\u2019Donovan Rossa\u2019s Skirmishers and [the] Clan na Gael\u2019.[CITATION-133] Coming after the end of the wars with the Zulus, Afghans and followers of Colonel \u2018Urabi, this reflected a turn away from the possibility of placing the Skirmishing Funds in the hands of anti-British leaders in such conflicts, to their use in more directly attacking British power and prestige in the name of the Irish cause.Yet expressions of sympathy for other colonised peoples continued to be penned by the writers of, as shown not only by such elisions as \u2018Indian Fenians\u2019 but also by discussions of the Land War being fought elsewhere in the world in the early 1880s. As this article has shown, the interest in such locales as British India and its frontier with Afghanistan was the culmination of a long process of critical reflection in the Irish press and political circles on colonial rule. The process was formative of Irish anti-imperialism, commencing with Irish reflection on the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and continuing through the Great Eastern Crisis in the Ottoman world. By the mid-1870s, the anti-imperialism espoused indemonstrated perspicacious observation of the possibilities deriving from imperial rivalries, from the weaknesses at the edges or fringes of empires, and from inciting the British Empire\u2019s millions of Muslim subjects to rebellion. To dismiss as inconsequential this conjoined interest in Islam and empire in the struggle for liberation won (for part of the island) in 1922, is to overlook the cosmopolitanism of Irish-American anti-imperialist thought.[CITATION-134] To be sure, a frequently \u2018Orientalist\u2019 sense of racial difference and, occasionally, overt racial or religious prejudice (not least fervent antisemitism) runs through the pages of the Irish press. Yet Trans-Atlantic was for a time sharply critical of the characterisation of Muslims as fanatical \u2018Crescentaders\u2019 ors in British colonial discourse. In this, he embeddedwithin something much larger: a world-historical moment marked by numerous imaginative projects constituting Islam not only as a world religion but as a latent world power.[CITATION-135] ",
