    "article": "The intricacies of urban\u2013rural relations surface with rare detail from the records of Italian field wardens () from the late thirteenth to the mid-fifteenth century. Focusing on the region of Piedmont, in the peninsula\u2019s north-west, this article traces the policing of numerous sites and species by theas part of an urban bio- and agropolitical project. The office reflects the growing desire of towns to control their surrounding countryside, not only for military defence, but also as an essential source of calorific and hydraulic energy, a sink for waste and a stage on which to showcase their power before internal and external audiences. Reconstructing the remits, norms and actions of field wardens thus illuminates power negotiations that were shaped by a range of environmental factors and the era\u2019s thinking about hygiene. Yet analysing the activities and responsibilities of thealso reveals the tactics that rural dwellers devised to contest urban discipline, for instance through self-help, concealment and the embellishment of charges made against them. From the perspective of the area\u2019s historiography, the dynamics captured by these records challenge the centrality of landed aristocracies in narratives of political centralisation. And from a broader perspective, the granular view they afford of middling officials at work invites historians to explore what urbanisation meant at the ground level, on either side of the city walls.Sometime in October 1356, the monks of Sant\u2019Andrea, a Benedictine house in Turin affiliated with the abbey of San Pietro in Breme, petitioned the council of the region\u2019s secular lord, Amadeus VI of Savoy (r. 1343\u201383). The issue at hand was the conduct of the duke\u2019s castellan (or vicar) in Rivoli, and specifically his actions in nearby Gonzole, which pertained to Sant\u2019Andrea\u2014and by extension to San Pietro in Breme\u2014from the early tenth century. Since 1315 at the latest the abbey had held the privilege of appointing local, or field wardens, \u2018to guard the grain and other hinterland goods in the place and district of Gonzole and its appurtenances\u2019.[CITATION-1] Wielding Gonzole\u2019s statutes, the procurator of Sant\u2019Andrea, brother Giovanello Remenzono of Chivasso, reminded the council that neither the castellan nor any of the count\u2019s officers could licitly intervene in the procedures to nominateor adjudicate the offences that they cited. Nonetheless, he lamented, it had come to pass that field wardens were being forced to register their cases before the vicar of Rivoli, collect their fines on the basis of legalthat his administration drafted, and even swear oaths of allegiance directly to him.[CITATION-2] Named participants in the dispute (priory, abbey, vicar, council, and the count himself) were well aware that jurisdictional struggles over the operation of field wardens in Rivoli\u2019s hinterland had legal and financial as well as political implications. The impact of the struggle, however, registered among further, unnamed but major, stakeholders: local towns and cities. Piedmont\u2019s burgeoning urban network, including Rivoli, Turin, Pinerolo and other towns treated in this article, took a strong interest in their surrounding countrysides and, from the mid-thirteenth century at the latest, appointedto monitor them. It was a critically important office, emblematic of the area\u2019s (and Europe\u2019s) transition from modest to widescale agricultural production, which both drove and was driven by demographic growth and urbanisation.[CITATION-3] For Piedmont\u2019s urban regimes,served as eyes and ears on the ground: a rural policing force that maintained a certain order in the proliferating fields, forests, orchards, vineyards, roads, fishponds, waterways and millruns that fed swelling urban populations, supplied them with fuel, kept grounds well drained and absorbed growing heaps of (mostly organic) waste.[CITATION-4] These officials\u2019 vigilance moreover helped ensure that pertinent infrastructures were well maintained, and reduced the presence of what the anthropologist Mary Douglas famously termed \u2018matter out of place\u2019:[CITATION-5] stolen goods, unwholesome produce, obstructive debris, run-off water, unsupervised animals, and, indeed, misbehaving people.Like their urban counterparts, theor road masters, and aided by other municipal officers,became instrumental in keeping cities healthy and safe.[CITATION-6] In and beyond Piedmont, they patrolled communes\u2019 physical and normative boundaries and facilitated a smooth flow along transportation routes, which increasingly stretched into, or else originated in, the countryside.[CITATION-7] Field wardens were distinctive, however, in the combined spatial and biological remits of their office, which means that reconstructing their activities illuminates the relations between cities\u2019 (attempts at) political centralisation and subject rural populations\u2019 management of agricultural resources. As the present article demonstrates, the desire of cities to expand their food baskets and regulate producers\u2019 behaviours generated friction, much of which converged upon the field wardens\u2019 office.[CITATION-8] The symbiotic relationship between town and country that therepresented is made manifest in the legal case with which I began. Cognizant of the intricate links between population health, hinterland order and political legitimacy, and economically motivated as well, Amadeus VI\u2019s administration encroached upon Sant\u2019Andrea\u2019s privileges as part of a concerted expansion of its own apparatus of rulership.[CITATION-9] The law, too, was on Amadeus\u2019s side. As the castellan\u2019s envoy counter-argued before the council, the count\u2019s civil and criminal jurisdiction () meant that Gonzole could have direct allegiance only to him, rejecting the claim made by brother Giovanello, the monks\u2019 advocate, that the castellan\u2019s action was illicit.[CITATION-10] To end the dispute, the council proposed a compromise, which Amadeus readily accepted and recommended to his vicar in Rivoli in a letter that also chronicled the foregoing events: Gonzole\u2019swould henceforth be appointed solely by the prior of Sant\u2019Andrea and without any interference on the part of the castellan or count. However, these officials were to bring allegations before the castellan and no one else, in recognition of his superior jurisdiction.[CITATION-11] The proposal thus essentially espoused the recent development, which the monks framed as a violation of their ancient privileges. As such, it helped to cement Amadeus\u2019s claims and to integrate thefurther into his administration, including by prescribing their norms of office. This was certainly in line with Savoy\u2019s robust administrative apparatus, which historians have long discussed in terms of its successful absorption of cisalpine territories.[CITATION-12] Yet by focusing much of Piedmont\u2019s historiography on the rulership of Savoy (and other aristocratic families), an important urban dimension is lost with respect to local biopolitics, or the negotiation of power at the level of life,[CITATION-13] and specifically the agropolitics attendant upon the shifting urban\u2013rural divide of the region and the era. Towns and cities seeking to create, expand and discipline hinterlands played a major and often independent role in these negotiations, as urban residents across socio-economic strata relied directly on the countryside for energy input, waste disposal, income and status.The charges brought by the monks of Sant\u2019Andrea, then, begin to illustrate howhelped, not only monasteries and aristocratic regimes, but especially cities and the urban landlords they housed, to \u2018seea state\u2019. If we remove the italics, the phrase harks back to the anthropologist James C. Scott\u2019s analysis of modern state-building from the perspective of expertise and record-production, a technology whose power to flatten a pluriform administrative landscape served (and at times undermined) a government\u2019s desire to rule vast territories with greater efficiency or at least legitimacy.[CITATION-14] Scott describes this capacity as rendering diverse domains \u2018legible\u2019 to administrators who were increasingly removed from them; to that extenttook part in a very similar process, albeit on a smaller scale and without necessarily being complicit in the birth of the modern state (hence my italics). At any rate, the crucial role of these officials, as chief enforcers of an urban regime\u2019s biopolitical programme, has mostly gone unnoticed.For much of Italy, evidence concerning urban field wardens is thin on the ground before the sixteenth century, which partly explains the neglect of the office by historians working on earlier eras. As the present article shows, however, reconstructing the activities of these officials is both possible and demonstrative of a major aspect of the region\u2019s intertwined urban and rural history. Following the steps of the, as they emerge first from normative sources (Section I), and then from diverse documents of practice (II and III), illustrates the ground-level negotiation involved in turning large swathes of Piedmont\u2019s countryside into an urban hinterland. It underscores in particular how municipal governments operating under the aegis of the area\u2019s rulers (including the Savoy, Acaja, Sforza and Monferrato) often pursued an at least semi-independent agenda through rural policing, an endeavour also shaped by, and in the service of, internal urban needs. In remaining direct subjects of sizeable aristocratic domains, Piedmont\u2019s urban communes largely operated within a different paradigm from that of their more famous and autonomous neighbours to the east and south, including Genoa, Venice, Bologna, Florence, Pisa and Siena, especially once the latter group\u2019s demographic growth and rapid economic ascent drove them to intensify trade as well as expand territorially.[CITATION-15] Nonetheless, Piedmontese practices were typical of a major chapter in the peninsula\u2019s urban history, from which they tend to be written out, having never become what is currently termed a city-state.[CITATION-16] Thus, in actively giving form to what Aldo Settia has identified as \u2018ruralit\u00e0 urbana\u2019,[CITATION-17] or urban rurality, the remits and actions of thetraced the city\u2019s territorial extremities while simultaneously pointing back to its legitimate, jurisdictional heart.Urban attempts to subdue the countryside (and \u2018nature\u2019 more broadly) in this way offer a unique, pre- or rather non-state example of pre-industrial agropolitics: that is, how cities combined the tasks of carving out hinterlands and buttressing their own political claims. Read discerningly, however, the same sources can tell a more nuanced story that captures the challenges of such attempts to change the land and its dwellers and the ambiguity surrounding the identity of who and what was being changed.[CITATION-18] As Section IV demonstrates, when read against the grain, the records of field wardens can help recover rural voices and practices of resistance that are often obscured by urban administrations and their later historians. At the same time, the process of uncovering the indeterminacy of power also serves as a reminder that, precisely during this period of urban growth, the line between rural and urban societies was often unclearly drawn. A social understanding of Europe\u2019s first major wave of urbanisation, and urban\u2013rural relations more broadly, benefits from looking more deliberately outside city walls, even if through tendentious urban sources.Amadeus VI\u2019s letter to his castellan in Rivoli confirms that field wardens in Gonzole, albeit nominated by the prior of Sant\u2019Andrea, were expected to abide by the norms formulated for the count\u2019s administrative corps. Yet most surviving statutes defining proper conduct foracross Piedmont were urban, not comital, in both their spatial remit and political and economic genesis. Accordingly, the present section focuses on how legislators tried to mobilise field wardens to ensure smooth flows to and from the countryside, as envisaged from an urban rather than a comital centre. The ordinances they produced are certainly limited in what they can tell us about the office\u2019s social realities. Yet they have the advantage that the survival of dozens of parallel texts from across the region creates sufficient room for comparing them and for situating our opening anecdote in a broader context (see).[CITATION-19] In fact, Rivoli itself sought to regulate its own, and seems to have succeeded in doing so with little intervention from the duke or his castellan. It will thus serve as the basis of this section.Campari in Piedmont,.1250\u20131500.Rivoli\u2019s first complete set of surviving statutes dates from 1457, although earlier by-laws and communal privileges had been approved by rulers of Savoy repeatedly since at least 1247, long after communes were functioning, if somewhat unselfconscious, entities.[CITATION-20] and later texts stress the commune\u2019s prerogative in appointing any and all officials they had been accustomed to employ, presumably including the town\u2019s field wardens, without the count\u2019s interference. No ratification text prior to 1457\u2014and these survive from 1247, 1349, 1384, 1408, 1436 and 1448\u2014mentions the introduction of field wardens into the city\u2019s administration or relates major amendments to their by-laws, while other records take their presence for granted.[CITATION-21] Even if the 1457 redaction of Rivoli\u2019s statutes altered the by-laws concerning the, then, all the indications are that the office would already have been in operation for at least one century (and probably more than two), a conclusion strengthened by these regulations\u2019 overall conformity with numerous other and earlier codes across Piedmont, as we shall soon observe. For the time being, let us see how the mid-fifteenth-century legislators framed the remit of those, mostly in a group of twelve rubrics, as well as through a number of additional ordinances. This serves as a preliminary step to sketching a regional profile of a common office, before moving to explore its social practices in later sections.The main discussion of field wardens\u2019 conduct commences quite late in the extant code (rubric 179 of 263, excluding later additions; on fo. 41 of 58 in total), possibly reflecting their middling status: \u2018Item, we establish and order that theof Rivoli, one and all, can and may accuse in Rivoli\u2019s court and testify against any person or animal that they had observed violating each and any of the above or subsequent ordinances\u2019.[CITATION-22] The text and its appendixes draw field wardens\u2019 specific attention to keeping order and managing flows of water, produce and livestock, including by repairing infrastructure and damages caused by non/human animals to local properties,[CITATION-23] be they fields, orchards, vineyards or residences;[CITATION-24] the illicit removal of produce; and cutting down trees.[CITATION-25] Officials and any other accusers must make these violations known within a month of their alleged perpetration and\u2014in the case of officials\u2014before their term ends.The next rubric in the series (c. 180) evokes and partly describes the geographical scope of field wardens\u2019 tasks, thereby staking the commune\u2019s jurisdictional claims, in this case the.[CITATION-26] Rivoli\u2019swere ordered to pay utmost () attention to the area under dispute with the people of Grugliasco to the east (which then fell under Turin\u2019s jurisdiction), while also covering the commune\u2019s boundary towards Alpignano in the north and towards Pavizone beyond the river Dora and Caselette to the north-west. Most importantly, whatever they discovered to be out of order and thus inhibiting movement anywhere in these areas had to be reported solely to Rivoli\u2019s own tribunal (\u2018accusare non alibi quod in curia Rippolarum\u2019), not the castellan\u2019s, signalling the town\u2019s greater autonomy in this matter as compared, for instance, with the less fortunate priory of Sant\u2019Andrea.To judge by the statutes, the position of field warden in Rivoli, as elsewhere in Piedmont, seems to have been laborious but remunerative. Like other urban officials across the peninsula, campari were appointed from the city\u2019s quarters to single, non-consecutive semesters, which in Rivoli commenced each year on the Feasts of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist (24 June and 17 December, respectively),[CITATION-27] the former date marking the beginning of harvest. As was also customary at the time, appointees could not reject or abscond from these positions. Nowhere is it explicitly stated how many men were to be appointed from each quarter, yet it was likely to be more than one, and perhaps even as many as three or four, depending on the size and circumstances of the areas each group oversaw. (As we shall later see for Turin, a group ofassigned to a certain area could hail from a mix of quarters.) Finally, field wardens operated under strict time and reporting requirements,[CITATION-28] and were subject to specific anti-corruption regulations,[CITATION-29] as was typical of numerous urban offices in and beyond Italy.[CITATION-30] Entry into office in Rivoli incurred some direct expenses for. For instance, they were to pay each of the city\u2019s four major officials, elected on the Feast of St John the Evangelist, one pound of pepper within a month of their appointment.[CITATION-31] They also had to plant specific trees in the commune\u2019s orchards and in their respective quarters, including hazelnut, elm and cherry, with no remuneration mentioned.[CITATION-32] The 1457 statutes are silent on the\u2019s salaries, but the men stood to receive a decent income from two (and possibly three) sources. First, any small-scale cultivator whose field yielded eightof grain or less would have to pay the field wardens a modest fee of no more than 12 denari for their services.[CITATION-33] Larger landowners had to hand over the yield of onefor every pair of oxen they used, in addition to the aforementioned fee.[CITATION-34] As a basic anti-corruption measure,were to receive such payments from owners in broad daylight and in a group numbering at least four people.[CITATION-35] Patrolling Rivoli\u2019s fields for six months was expected to be hard work, but, unlike direct cultivation, it came with a modicum of guaranteed income.Large lacunae in Rivoli\u2019s records preclude even a rough estimate of how common it was for local field wardens to live on these fees alone. However, it is highly unlikely that they had to do so. Extant documents of practice, to be explored below, as well as numerous statutes from other towns, highlight the frequency of fines levied directly byor the existence of fines that would at least be pertinent to their remits. In Rivoli, the castellan\u2019s case against anyone causing damage in fields or to hinterland properties would carry no legal weight (\u2018denuncia et totus illius processus ullam obtineat firmitatem seu valorem\u2019) without the physical presence of ain court and his direct () accusation of the perpetrator.[CITATION-36] The legal bind had financial implications, too, since\u2014as was usual across Italy in this period\u2014both private accusers anddenouncers would receive part of the fine levied following a successful prosecution,[CITATION-37] and Rivoli\u2019s procedure made it easy forto assume that role. Thus, although anyone in theory could accuse a violator in the hinterland, the tacit agreement ofmay have been aof such procedures. If so, they were practically assured a steady \u2018secondary\u2019 stream of income, although the precise ratio between their own accusations, cases brought by neighbours, and violations decried by other officials, may have varied greatly. What is more, as monitors of large areas,could in all likelihood have detected other types of deviant behaviour and secured further fines resulting from successful criminal prosecutions. Either way, when an allegation was legitimately brought by a neighbour in the absence of a, the castellan\u2019s fine could not exceed what awould have been allowed to levy,[CITATION-38] a limitation that made field wardens the more efficient outfit to police the countryside.It is worth dwelling on this point since, putting aside the financial interests of, as the face of the commune in the countryside they represented an alternative centre of authority each time they set foot in the count\u2019s court. Certainly, the court itself might be seen as enhancing the ruler\u2019s legitimacy. But the scope for action given to the castellan when thewas absent seems to have been quite narrow. The castellan could proceed in cases where the putative damage exceeded one gold florin, a rather high sum among agriculturalists, suggesting great destruction caused, for example, by a stampede or arson, and resulting in the devastation of entire crops, elements of infrastructure or multiple beasts. In lesser and arguably more common cases, where damages would amount to no more than 16 soldi, the castellan could not proceed without the direct involvement of the(or, presumably, his willingness to get involved) unless the perpetrator was caughtor in cases of arson or major harm. It is in keeping with these urban agropolitics that the field warden\u2019s responsibilities also entailed an obligation to accuse an alleged offender personally with the formula(\u2018I will charge you\u2019) upon discovery.[CITATION-39] Rivoli\u2019shad access to a third and potentially important revenue stream, which in turn illuminates urban dwellers\u2019 links to the countryside, including as agricultural landlords. The 1457 statutes forbade field wardens from cultivating during their office.[CITATION-40] Specifically, they could not own a field, be it in the city\u2019s territory or elsewhere, or even supervise private works, especially during their office\u2019s high season, which legislators defined as fifteen days before and after both the Feast of St John the Baptist (9 June\u20139 July) and Michaelmas (14 September\u201314 October). The consequences for acaught breaking this rule would be severe, as he would not only be fined 3 grossi per day of illicit labour, but would also lose his share of any successful accusation made during that period. (Lost revenue in such cases would revert to the commune\u2019s coffers.) In a remarkable concession, however, Rivoli\u2019s statutes allowed field wardens to elect four men each year from among themselves who could work with impunity even within the forbidden period.[CITATION-41] The text does not restrict the size of the cultivated plots, which means that the exception could have augmented field wardens\u2019 income substantially, assuming they maintained a reasonable balance with their regular duties and shared their proceeds. The concession provided one way to ease the burden of office (which, to reiterate, they could not legally reject), making room for some internal rotation. Elsewhere, for instance in Turin (see below), the appointment of teams consisting of interchangeable fathers and sons, or of two brothers, may have created similar flexibility. And other loopholes, for instance long-term leasing, may also have figured into the design of a sustainable office in some communes. Such concessions remind us that urban dwellers could hold real stakes (including new or existing residences) in the countryside, which in turn makes it difficult to distinguish clearly between urban and rural societies with separate agendas.At any rate, legislators sought to create conditions under which field wardens could police the hinterland effectively and honestly. They did so cognizant of the key role ofin monitoring a highly significant strategic resource from the city\u2019s perspective: a complex territory that functioned for many residents as a major source of calorific and/or monetary income, and by the same token an indicator of their social status; the location of an expanding infrastructural network designed to ensure the city\u2019s steady flow of food and clean water inwards and goods and refuse outwards; and, finally, as a defensive barrier of paramount importance, even (indeed, especially) when considered in isolation from other Savoy territorial holdings. From an urban perspective, then, Rivoli\u2019s countryside was a public good and a collective resource complicated, but not essentially undermined, by being parcelled out into numerous private or privately operated plots and cultivated by people of different statuses and cultural identities.Rivoli\u2019s statutes regarding the conduct and finances ofshare many particulars with those of numerous towns and cities across Piedmont between the mid-thirteenth and fifteenth century.[CITATION-42] Whatever relationships these communes had with regional overlords, therefore, they promulgated quite similar statutes concerning their field wardens, as they did in many other areas of urban government, and following similar chronologies. But how accurately did they reflect or indeed influence social practices?Although field wardens were common cogs in municipal machineries from at least the mid-thirteenth century, they are all but absent from scholarship on the period and region in question.[CITATION-43] In part this state of affairs reflects the influence of demographic and economic themes in the historiography of the Italian countryside, whose focus on yields, production and ownership patterns has tended to draw on rich data from tax and land surveys rather than on evidence for daily enforcement.[CITATION-44] Cultural and religious historians have likewise yet to examine the records relating to, concerned as they remain with analysing hinterlands (in and well beyond Piedmont) as ideological, spiritual and emotional constructs, often on the basis of literary texts and artworks, or else as a major location of exploitation and feuding.[CITATION-45] By comparison, agrarian and environmental historians\u2019 neglect ofis noteworthy, given their emphasis on how land clearance and the region\u2019s intensive cultivation led to ecological degradation, including erosion and frequent floods, a process that perhaps helped to recast the countryside as a landscape provoking fear.[CITATION-46] Certainly, the invisibility ofsays much about the fragmentary state of the documentation relating to the office prior to the sixteenth century, when normative texts begin to appear in print and circulate more broadly.[CITATION-47] As the following sections continue to demonstrate, however, thehardly saw the debut ofas government officials. A significant portfolio of diverse sources dating back at least to the late thirteenth century can extend our understanding of rural life and cities\u2019 needs therein, even if their preliminary examination offers no more than what Maria Clotilde Daviso di Charvensod, a pioneering economic historian of Piedmont, once called \u2018un invito e un assaggio\u2019.[CITATION-48] Evidence for field wardens\u2019 practices can be divided into three main types of sources: financial records documenting their contributions to a city\u2019s and/or regional lord\u2019s coffers; official deliberations and communications at the municipal level; and records generated by field wardens themselves, especially their summary justice procedures containing accusations, inquests, and fines levied, contested and paid. Beyond these types of sources, to be presently surveyed, there are occasional yet significant records of field wardens\u2019 activities, such as the Green Count\u2019s letter to his castellan in Rivoli with which this article began. Turin\u2019s Archivio Storico offers two further kinds of documents directly attesting the actions of: one is a receipt () issued on 7 July 1331 by a notary on behalf of thein the area of Drosso, then part of Turin\u2019s south-western hinterland, for a fine paid in full by a certain Giovannetto, charged along with his brothers for a violation involving their \u2018beasts and animals\u2019.[CITATION-49] The second type of source is similarly hard to come by, namely lists of accusations and fines originally compiled by the notary of the, and later collated during their end-of-term audit or. In Turin, two such lists have survived intact in scroll form, dating to 1352 and 1373 respectively, and augmenting the single surviving register of the daily activities of thefrom 1372 (a source type to be discussed below). The distilled information filling these scrolls illuminates the pattern of the field wardens\u2019 local activities (andof alleged violations) and helps to establish their financial contribution and compliance with anti-corruption measures at the municipal and castellany level. The depth and diversity of these records suggests that their current scarcity owes more to poor preservation than intermittent record-keeping.If, therefore, as James C. Scott has argued, the rise of early states was greatly premised on a smooth and safe functioning of their agrarian territories, their later Italian heirs faced a similar challenge.[CITATION-50] In Piedmont, urban hinterlands held a clear military-strategic value, and agriculture, including animal husbandry, fed communities and armies and contributed handsomely to rulers\u2019 wealth by means of direct and indirect taxes. Little of that would have been possible without the rigorous enforcement of urban policies at the local level. Our understanding of how agropolitics in Piedmont took shape accordingly benefits from an integrated view of the region\u2019s judicial fines and ecology, including the value of the upkeep of rural infrastructures by. To begin with financial viability: the fines that field wardens meted out made rather modest contributions to rulers\u2019 coffers. For instance, in the castellany of Turin, between October 1328 and December 1329 the \u2018banni minuti dei campari\u2019 totaled 23 lire, 5 soldi, 7 denari, after deducting what was owed to the commune and the field wardens themselves, which amounted to more than 50 per cent of the entire sum. That is less than 10 per cent of the income generated from all fines collected by the castellan, and just above 1 per cent of the castellany\u2019s overall income that year.[CITATION-51] In the nearby castellany of Moncalieri the category of minor fines, including \u2018banni campestri\u2019, accounted for a similar rate of 10 per cent of the income from fines related to the administration of justice between 1313 and 1331.[CITATION-52] In Susa and Bussoleno, by contrast, between March 1345 and April 1346 revenue from the administration of justice reached a notable 42 per cent of the castellany\u2019s admittedly modest income. Yet most of the fines issued concerned violent offences carrying high penalties, and almost none can be traced back to discoveries made by local field wardens.[CITATION-53] And in Caselette, well-kept accounts record the small sum of 4 lire, 4 soldi, 6 denari raised from fines imposed bybetween 1319 and 1325.[CITATION-54] It seems likely that the small amounts exacted from rural dwellers reflected the desire of landlords and communes to keep tenants on the land, even before the depletion of labourers after the Black Death. Yet, given its negligible direct input, the office ofmust have carried (or was at least perceived as offering) alternative benefits to the communes, for instance as a preventative mechanism against damage and corruption, and more broadly as promoting the centralising agenda of urban regimes. Indeed, however modest the contributions ofappear to have been, their ubiquitous presence in annual accounts strongly suggests systematic record-keeping, although their very modesty may likewise explain the poor survival of those records.[CITATION-55] Next, records of city council deliberations capture the dynamics of the appointment of, the officials\u2019 seasonally shifting attention and their role in (intra-) urban politics. The focus of these sources on the city\u2019s internal affairs tends to obscure city\u2013castellany relations, which are often foregrounded by the financial records just explored, and whose main audience was the comital chancery. Moreover, the details they disclose help establish the degree to which the city\u2019s regulations concerning field wardens were enforced on the ground.[CITATION-56] In Turin, for instance, twenty-four, six from each of the city\u2019s four quarters (clockwise from the north: Porta Doranea, Porta Marmorea, Porta Nuova and Porta Posterla) gathered each year around the feast of All Saints (1 November) to nominate \u2018canparij et custodes bonorum forensium\u2019 for extramural regions falling under the city\u2019s direct control.[CITATION-57] Some of these territories appear quite regularly in the minutes of council deliberations, including the area(beyond the River Dora) to the north,(beyond the River Stura) further to the north, Venchiglia to the east,(beyond the River Po) further to the east, San Salvario to the south-east, the area beyond Porta Nuova to the south, and Coleasca to the west ().[CITATION-58] A, later fourteenth century.Archivio Storico della Citt\u00e0 di Torino, Carte sciolte 390, Codex catena, fo. 29v. Image courtesy of the Archivio Storico della Citt\u00e0 di Torino.Here as elsewhere, quarter representatives nominatedfor all territories at once, ostensibly without pre-allocating remits to specific neighbourhoods. This may have discouraged particular quarters from developing a stable extension into a specific area, or, more positively put, fostered a city-wide responsibility for policing the hinterland and seeing it as a strategic whole. Either way, evidence for the appointment of field wardens is abundant for Turin. On 31 October 1328, for example, thenominated a total of eight men, oneeach for,, Coleasca, Porta Nuova, Porta Marmorea and Venchiglia, and two for the dependent commune of Grugliasco.[CITATION-59] Three years later, however, the council approved appointments for six field wardens to work, four, two in Coleasca, one in Porta Nuova, three in Porta Marmorea, one in Venchiglia and one in the dependent commune of Drosso, more than doubling the number of officials.[CITATION-60] That number was maintained, albeit in a slightly different constellation, on 2 November 1375, when thewere tasked with filling sixslots beyond the Po, four beyond the Dora, three in Coleasca and its environs, two beyond the Stura and three for the area extending from San Salvario until the Sangone river (\u2018fines Sancti Salvari, Glareti, Prati Clausi et Salmazeti usque ad flumen Sangoni\u2019).[CITATION-61] As these examples suggest, anywhere between one and six field wardens were tasked with monitoring each territory, depending on its size, topography and strategic location\u2014as well as officials\u2019 availability, which at times of crisis could be limited, for instance around the onset of the Black Death.[CITATION-62] The trans-Posoon emerged as a consistently larger and better-paid group, in part because of their vicinity to the city and related performance of guard duty at the Po bridge.[CITATION-63] Changes in the number of field wardens per territory and the territory\u2019s specific scope likewise reflected shifts in the physical constitution of Turin\u2019s, especially as it expanded southward. Lastly,operating in dependent communes such as Drosso to the south-west and Grugliasco to the west were also appointed by the council but with less regularity and not always in sync with the procedure for the city\u2019s own field wardens.[CITATION-64] Occasionally, the council\u2019s treatment of irregularities in appointment procedures throws local norms into relief. For instance, Antonio Martelli, Vrieto Maurini and Bartolomeo de Brianda were appointed belatedly to the \u2018officium camparie et custodie pontis Paudi\u2019 in late January 1352, apparently in a separate procedure.[CITATION-65] After the election of field wardens in November 1376 had concluded, it emerged that the trans-Po contingent had served too recently to be legitimately considered for the position again and they accordingly had to be dismissed and replaced.[CITATION-66] On 1 December 1378 ninewere still on duty after more than a year in office.[CITATION-67] And in 1384 the council responded to complaints by the San Salvaro, instructing that any hindrance to their operations must be immediately reported to the vicar or judge.[CITATION-68] On at least one occasion the count himself intervened in the procedure. This occurred in late December 1352 when Amadeus VI dismissed thesent across the Po by the appointingand asked for them to be replaced, for unspecified reasons.[CITATION-69] It is unclear whether the count also had a hand in a request to the city council in late 1369, namely to advise on whether to maintain the current appointment system or nominate a single officer to assemble a team.[CITATION-70] The council decided to retain the existing system, which it maintained for another decade, when the idea of nominating a singlecame up again, this time gaining greater traction.[CITATION-71] Subsequently, fivebegan the process of identifying \u2018aliquem bonum campayrolium\u2019, whom they found in a certain Henriguccio de Castro Einaudi. It was at this point that the count\u2019s vicar and a judge joined the search committee to complete negotiations with Henriguccio, proposing that he receive a salary of 160 florins for one year, to be paid in three instalments, beginning on 16 March.[CITATION-72] He was to fulfil his tasks along with five assistants and two officers on horseback. However, the offer ultimately failed to convince the city council, which once again opted for less rather than more centralisation, and resumed at a slight delay the earlier mode of appointing.[CITATION-73] Turin may not typify the trajectory of the field wardens\u2019 office across Piedmont, let alone Italy. Yet its council\u2019s deliberative records do reflect common challenges thatfaced in trying to discipline a city\u2019s hinterland, and the extent to which their appointment and norms presented local power brokers with opportunities to stake their claims. Given the council\u2019s limited interest in recording all aspects of caring for the city\u2019s common good, however, the council\u2019s discussions rarely illuminate the daily grind ofand how their mandate was pursued on the ground. It is to the latter aspects of the era\u2019s agropolitics that we now turn.An extensive search for documents of practice generated by thethemselves, in dozens of archives and scores of inventories throughout Piedmont, yielded six registers in the town of Pinerolo for the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century,[CITATION-74] one in Turin for the later fourteenth,[CITATION-75] and one in Chieri for the mid-fifteenth.[CITATION-76] In Vercelli, a series of judicial acts from the later fourteenth and fifteenth century contains several registers compiled by the city\u2019s damage assessors with numerous allegations made by publicas well.[CITATION-77] The latter volumes deserve further attention, especially since similar entries may well exist elsewhere, embedded within the rich court records of local communes.[CITATION-78] For now, the extant source base remains modest, but given the abundance ofrecords that had to draw on the original reporting of(see Section I), these registers probably preserve a typical form of record-keeping, one moreover that is consistent across time and space. Such careful documentation was useful in the first instance since it helped field wardens manage their workloads and communicate with other officials, curbed corruption, and served as a baseline from which to calculate the city\u2019s (and consequently the count\u2019s) income from hinterland policing. Yet the specific ways in which these registers were compiled tell us more about the government\u2019s aspirations and worldview. The eightregisters surviving in their original form today contain thousands of entries relating, in the first instance, who made the charge and when, the nature of the offence and its location, the identity of the direct offender (often a non-human animal)[CITATION-79] and that of its owner or employer, if known. These were the basic details required to pursue the summary justice procedure common to the period, which rarely involved parties actually arguing before a judge. However, appeals and follow-ups including (partial) payments, acquittals, deaths and compromises regularly make an interlinear or marginal appearance, comprising the bulk of a second layer of information added to almost every entry within days or weeks of its original composition.Despite their relative scarcity today, then, the daily records of theoffer a granular view of these officials\u2019 activities and\u2014no less important\u2014of behaviours they perceived as deviant among different species in a city\u2019s hinterland. It is through these accounts, however narrow and intentional, that field wardens communicated their role as officers enforcing an urban programme in the countryside and captured attempts to obstruct it. The present section analyses the two earliest survivingvolumes, both from Pinerolo, covering two administrative semesters. As a sample of an aggregate year\u2019s activity, it reveals the scale and scope of one outfit\u2019s routines, as therotated through seasons, territories and production cycles. The texts lend themselves to many additional types of analysis, including patterns of land ownership and yields, labour and family relations, and of course technologies of husbandry, industry and cultivation. None of these have been attempted here, however; the present section (and indeed this article) is chiefly concerned with how the management of the countryside was framed, pursued and resisted as an urban political project. In order to do so, it begins by briefly introducing the town in question.In the late thirteenth century Pinerolo was a regionally important, modest-sized town in west Piedmont, perched on a hill along the lower Val Chisone. Already under the rule of Savoy, it had reached its pre-industrial demographic peak of around 1,800 hearths or an estimated 8,000 inhabitants, and was developing its road and water infrastructure apace. Statutes and other sources from this period project an overall consistent effort to keep the city and its environment clean, drained and well provided for.[CITATION-80] As was the case across urban Italy, monitoring and repairing infrastructure within the city walls generally fell to localor roads officials, while extramural sites defined the remit of Pinerolo\u2019s. As such, they often tended to encounter (disputes over) multi-species deviancy and damage to private and public property in the hinterland, including to crops, fences, canals and roads, all of which helped keep the urban population well fed, markets active and road- and water-borne waste flowing out of town.Although the city\u2019s earliest statutes, dating to 1220, mentionoperating in Pinerolo\u2019s hinterland, they do not explicitly describe them as commune officials, and thus may refer to privately employed rural guards, another common usage of the term.[CITATION-81] By 1318, however, legislators called for the election of three field wardens once a year, on the Feast of All Saints (1 November). They had to swear before a judge that they would guard extramural \u2018roads and bridges and charge those who cause them damage\u2019 (\u2018custodire ipsas vias et pontes et accusare damnum facientes in eisdem\u2019), and were to receive for their labour 20 soldi a year and 5 soldi per offence they detected and successfully prosecuted. Much like the intramural,too were held financially responsible for deteriorated infrastructure, a physical focus underscoring their public function and the commune\u2019s claims.[CITATION-82] The 1318 ordinances post-date field wardens\u2019 actual introduction into the municipal apparatus, since their earliest extant register dates to 1292, with a further five volumes currently preserved in the city\u2019s Archivio Comunale reaching into the 1330s.[CITATION-83] These appear to be both the oldest and most extensive group ofrecords surviving for the entire region.A full study of field wardens\u2019 registers from Pinerolo remains a desideratum. Yet even concentrating on the earliest exemplars sketches a clear and dynamic profile of the officials monitoring the town\u2019s hinterland as the agricultural year wore on. The ledgers chosen, which cover two administrative semesters (June to December 1292 and January to July 1299),[CITATION-84] stand several years apart. Yet, since there is no external evidence that either period exhibited extraordinary or divergent weather or disease conditions,[CITATION-85] their combined data can be used to reconstruct the tenor of a compound year, at least from a surveillance perspective.[CITATION-86] Over the course of these twelve months,made some 1,286 discoveries (), an average of 3.5 charges per day,[CITATION-87] which were carried out by an unknown number of officials and almost equally split between the two semesters under examination (680 and 606 incidents, respectively).[CITATION-88] That datum alone underscores the regularity and intensity of urban hinterland surveillance, asobtained information mostly through direct observation or else by investigating residents\u2019 complaints () on site. Either way, officials\u2019 perambulations in the countryside brought them into immediate contact with local dwellers and labourers of all statuses, and the charges they made translated the social realities they chose to focus on into a coherent, if inevitably partial, administrative picture.The registers accordingly project a clear image of the kind of orderpursued on behalf of Pinerolo and its resident rural landlords.shows that a small majority of allegations (715; 55.5 per cent) deal with acts of trespassing, that is, when a non-human animal, mostly with but sometimes without a human handler, entered private or public property uninvited. Detecting further matter out of place (humans and goods not being where they should) is implicit in another major group of offences, namely theft (249; 19.5 per cent), and the minor categories of property damage (37; 2.9 per cent) and illicit grazing (34; 2.6 per cent). Animals left unsupervised () account for the third-largest category of cases (173; 13.5 per cent), where the focus of the complaint was evidently the danger posed to other species, crops and infrastructure elements through a form of specifically human neglect. (Unsupervised livestock could in theory have also been trespassing, but the complaints do not make that aspect of the offence explicit.) The fact that all these cases were recorded highlights the urgency felt by an urban regime to convey to residents on either side of the city walls what defined danger and disorder.charges, 1292 I and 1299 II (cumulative).ASPi, AG 882 and 908.charges, 1292 I and 1299 II (cumulative).ASPi, AG 882 and 908.The 1,286 complaints that field wardens dealt with during a twelve-month period involved at least seventeen types of non/human animals roaming the countryside individually or in different-sized groups. Such minute recording of the presence of animals and their aggregation is a boon to agrarian and environmental historians, although our main focus here is what caught the attention of theas agents of disorder. Other than humans (men, women, children), these were all domesticated animals; wild animals and other competitors for fodder such as deer are entirely absent from the records, illustrating once again how these texts articulate the view of therather than the environment\u2019s full variety of life.[CITATION-89] They also shed light on the wardens\u2019 priorities within the target group and how much effort it took to detect each species. Asrelates, humans and bovines constituted the largest groups of alleged offenders (412 and 465, respectively), but while humans were mostly charged as sole culprits, cows, bulls, oxen and calves were cited in pairs or trios. Swine (pigs, sows and piglets; 247) made up the third-largest group and exhibited numeric diversity, as offending pigs averaged three species members together, sows were usually discovered by themselves, and piglets travelled in groups averaging five, excluding single sows that sometimes accompanied them. By far the largest wayward herds, however, were sheep, averaging just over sixteen fluffy friends. The aggregation reflects the common practice of grazing sheep in herds, which also reflects their tendency to do poorly in solitude.[CITATION-90] Incidents with equines (horses, mares, mules, foals and donkeys) averaged one species member and those concerning goats averaged around four. In total, the records examined capture some 3,516 animals (very possibly with some overlap) violating city ordinances over the course of a compound year.[CITATION-91] Charges by species, 1292 I and 1299 II (cumulative).ASPi, AG 882 and 908. The weighted number of cases is 1,349, reflecting cases in which thecharged a second species member or group thereof.Charges by species, 1292 I and 1299 II (cumulative).ASPi, AG 882 and 908. The weighted number of cases is 1,349, reflecting cases in which thecharged a second species member or group thereof.essentially policed by identifying matter out of place. Their registers contain detailed information about how multiple species travelled to and from different locations, and how that movement put them, and sometimes others, at risk. Indeed, many entries allow us to reconstruct a certain person\u2019s, beast\u2019s or flock\u2019s (deviant) itineraries throughout the day or month as they crossed different private and public boundaries. For instance, on 12 January 1299 Manfredo of Osasco led no less than fifteen oxen and six calves through the field of the heirs of a certain Giovanni. Manfredo was cited for the violation, but apparently with little deterring effect, for he trespassed into the same field again that day, this time accompanied by a horse and a donkey.[CITATION-92] On 22 January that year, Francesco Silvatici was cited for entering another\u2019s vineyard with four of his pigs, upon which he left the plot, only to re-enter it later that day with a single pig, garnering the\u2019s renewed attention and a second fine. A week later, on 29 January, a certain Bonino allowed six of his pigs to trespass into two different properties consecutively. And on 1 March, Bergerio, the shepherd of Bertino Andeberti, led seventy sheep along a public road, which the group collectively departed to enter the field of Giovanni Rochete and then that of Piero Ripa.[CITATION-93] These incidents hint at the diversity of species, offences and sites captured by theregisters throughout the seasons and in a specific environmental context.[CITATION-94] The dataset as a whole underscores certain patterns of enforcement following the agricultural seasons. Asand[CITATION-4] illustrate, for instance, 48.7 per cent of charges (657) are concentrated in the harvest period between June and September, with a further isolated peak in January (159; 11.7 per cent)\u2014although its composition of offences strongly resembles that of the main cluster and to a great extent that of all other individual months as well. Indeed, with one partial exception, all months exhibit similar ratios between charges: trespassing constitute the greatest number, and often the majority, of accusations, accompanied in non-peak months by a near parity between theft andcharges and in peak months by a 2:1 or even 3:1 ratio between the latter. The exception is August, where theft charges slightly exceed trespassing accusations (69 vs. 64), which explains the highest number in our sample of humans charged in a calendar month (88; 21.3 per cent of all charges against humans as direct offenders over the year)\u2014humans being the only species to be charged with theft. August is also the month with the highest number overall (37) of animals discovered, perhaps reflecting owners\u2019 preoccupation with hay-making, the weaning of animals born in the spring or simply the exhausting summer heat and the urgency of finding shade and water.[CITATION-95] The numerically minor category of property damage offences is concentrated in March (10, of 37 charges throughout the year), which, however, does not alter the general pattern and ratios among the major charges. Collectively, the distribution of detected offences suggests thatpaid much attention to patrolling private and public boundaries, and thus property and infrastructure, yet they did so within a seasonal context, which directed their gaze to particular species, activities and sites.Main sites and charges (monthly).Archivio Storico della Citt\u00e0 di Pinerolo, Atti giudiziari 882 and 908.Main sites and species (monthly).Archivio Storico della Citt\u00e0 di Pinerolo, Atti giudiziari 882 and 908.Much remains to be clarified and more fully explained about these data, the temporal and spatial distribution of events, and their relationship with a specific socio-economic and topographical context. The heightened ratio between theft andcharges in peak months, for instance, could be attributed, on the one hand, to the weaker monitoring of non-human animals during harvest, and, on the other, to the abundance of crops in local fields, orchards and vineyards. The latter comprise the most commonly reported theft sites (49, 44 and 47, respectively; 56 per cent cumulatively), which also suggests thatgravitated towards them during harvest season, although the hypothesis of over-representation demands further testing.[CITATION-96] The isolated peak in charges during January presents another issue requiring explanation. Assuming that the increase in allegations that month reflects a common phenomenon (which future studies may challenge), it could be explained by seasonal factors, including the relative scarcity of food and limited traversable roads, that may in turn have led to more allegations of trespassing. It is also possible, however, that reduced agricultural activity in the fields (and their barrenness, along with that of forests, orchard and vineyards) allowedto spot animals more easily and fine their owners accordingly. At any rate, the records attest the desire of field wardens to hone an expertise and to know and manipulate a hinterland\u2014as well as the obstacles they faced in doing so, to which we now turn.Different species, including humans, ignored and were oblivious to rules imposed upon them by different political entities. Yet those acts that made it into the registers ofbroke a specific set of norms that urban governments sought to enforce in their hinterlands, and in the service of their well-being. Violations thus tended to grow more out of a subset of urban anxieties about and perceptions of the countryside than rural dwellers\u2019 consent in seeing such acts as deviant, dangerous or worth addressing. As we have seen, in and beyond Pinerolo,steered clear of policing wild animals or human behaviours which had an impact on them, such as (illegal) hunting; and, with the partial exception of arson, they never dealt with violent interpersonal crime, which certainly occurred in the countryside.[CITATION-97] By contrast, the defence of crops, infrastructure and domesticated animals was high on field wardens\u2019 agendas, tasked as they were with maintaining the value of the hinterland for urban residents. Swine, for instance, were far more prominent in these sources than any other species(127; 71.7 per cent), and were moreover often associated with rural women as neglectful supervisors. The combination reinforces the reputation of pigs in this era (and earlier) as uniquely unruly, along with the perception that (in this case, rural) women were to be held responsible for their misbehaviour.[CITATION-98] If so, the management of pigs apparently fell within the rural domestic remit rather than being associated with the rustic male domain of farming and animal husbandry.[CITATION-99] Pigs, alongside other animals, may have also been responsible for causing damage to infrastructure.records construed such offences as threatening hinterland, and thereby urban, order, and although they could be attributed to human neglect or active manipulation, the actual culprits often remain anonymous and were subsequently dismissed (see below). Complaints included broken fences, potted roads and leaking waterways, deteriorations that inhibited travel, reduced flow in millruns and harmed crops.[CITATION-100] They were sometimes expressly framed as public safety concerns, as \u2018damage caused to neighbours\u2019 (), a sphere municipal governments were clearly interested in defining and controlling.[CITATION-101] Lastly, when it came to the most common offence of trespassing, it was specifically men (955; 80 per cent of all human offenders generally) who were fined for the illicit movement of their livestock into private or public lands, although this was often the fault of their siblings, children or hired herders. In enforcing the norms imposed by Pinerolo\u2019s commune on its hinterland, localthus promoted a particular view of rural life, with strict divisions of labour along gender and generational lines, a strong influence of kinship and a legal focus on the paterfamilias.Labour realities and social relations were probably far messier, however. And as is often the case with normative texts and even records of disciplinary procedures, it is wise to postulate a yawning gap between the image emerging from official records and hinterland habits, let alone between the ideal of order pursued by towns and that informing the behaviour of rural dwellers. Fortunately, however, theregisters sometimes offer a unique glimpse of the indeterminacy of power in urban\u2013rural relations and the exercise of what Scott has termed the hidden transcripts of infra-politics.[CITATION-102] For instance, clashing prerogatives came into sharp relief when, on 7 November 1292, a certain Milone Varini defied the\u2019s explicit prohibition against leading his oxen across a private field, exclaiming, according to the charge, \u2018I will nonetheless pass through\u2019 (\u2018Ego transibo tamen\u2019).[CITATION-103] Most other acts of resistance were subtler, emerging out of rural dwellers\u2019 attempts to bend the system according to their habits and preferences.[CITATION-104] As we shall see, families sometimes chose to rely on their children to lead livestock along illicit paths and into private and public fields, for there was always a decent chance that, if caught, they would be absolved or receive a milder penalty thanks to their young age.[CITATION-105] Above all, the occasional unfamiliarity ofwith (or wilful ignorance of?) social relations and practices of dispute resolution in the countryside seems to have created chances for rural residents to avoid being fined. If so, interrogating acquittals in particular sheds light on the infra-politics of obstruction in the face of attempted centralisation. It is this category that we now consider.Most charges across the two registers (775; 57 per cent) were ostensibly resolved, an outcome the notary usually indicated by crossing out the original entry with parallel diagonal lines. Of these, however, 165 cases (21 per cent; 12 per cent of all discoveries) came to be entirely dismissed, with men making up the vast majority of the known accused (135; 81 per cent). In some cases an acquittal was explicitly justified by the culprit\u2019s young age. For instance, Raymondo, son of Romagnolo, was fined on 29 June 1292 for trespassing with three oxen into land owned by ser Piero Beciati, but was subsequently absolved \u2018quia minor\u2019. And Jacopo, son of Jacobetto, found stealing pears on 7 August that year, was presently acquitted \u2018because he was younger than seven years old\u2019 (\u2018quia minor erat vii annis\u2019).[CITATION-106] Shirking direct responsibility was also a useful tactic, as when, on 4 November 1292, the owner of a donkey found unsupervised admitted that he had lost the animal and was soon absolved.[CITATION-107] In other and more numerous cases of acquittal, however, judges framed the charges raised by theas spurious or based on a false reading of a situation\u2019s facts. Enough was evidently at stake on such occasions for alleged violators to make their way to court (or else mobilise a procurator) and plead their case. On 20 June 1292, for example, a field owner swore before a notary, following a trespassing complaint made ten days earlier, that one Andisia entered his field accompanied by two oxen with his full permission, leading to the charges against Andisia being dropped.[CITATION-108] On 16 August, a certain Isabella successfully fought her fine, stating that she walked through the field of Jacopo Alberti in order to avoid passing through water (\u2018non potevat ire aliunde nisi per aquam\u2019).[CITATION-109] On 21 October, thespotted two oxen occupying a vineyard owned by the brethren of Santo Stefano. He summoned their owner, a certain Socio, and charged him with neglecting to supervise the beasts, but he was soon forced to drop the charge because Socio proved he had permission to keep them there, although it is unclear if that permission was granted by the monks or their tenant.[CITATION-110] And on 26 November, ten oxen belonging to Giovanni Varini made their way through the field of Piero Saleti, ostensibly a trespassing offence. But Giovanni soon put it to the judge that he had the owner\u2019s permission to do so, and he was absolved.[CITATION-111] The registers provide insufficient details to establish whether the charging official in such cases was corrupt, gullible, ignorant, overzealous or a combination thereof. General animosity between urban and rural dwellers, which the bias of elite sources accentuated but hardly invented, may have also played an important role, not to mention rural dwellers\u2019 ignorance of (rather than just apathy towards) urban ways.[CITATION-112] Any and all of these tendencies, moreover, could have easily been fed by a regime\u2019s desire to insinuate itself into hinterland routines, exemplifying the tendency of governments and landlords to want to manage people and resources without a clear understanding of their environmental context.[CITATION-113] Rural dwellers\u2019 co-operation in order to void charges or reduce fines likewise may have stemmed from diverse grounds, social and political as well as economic. Beyond (intermittent) fidelity among the commune\u2019s rural subjects, it is plausible, for instance, that the usefulness of manure made certain herds\u2019 presence at different times of the year at least a reasonable trade-off for illicit grazing and trespassing.[CITATION-114] And settling disputes privately in order to deceive officials and/or avoid the wrath of landlords could have made perfect financial and political sense. This helps explain why allegations of trespassing and theft comprised 79 per cent (130) of all dismissed charges.[CITATION-115] Nonetheless, the constant presence ofensured that, even when local residents and landowners preferred to settle accounts directly with one another, doing so without the administration\u2019s involvement was quite difficult. For, even when aaccepted an owner\u2019s word that a would-be trespasser was welcome on their land, they had to give that word as part of a troublesome procedure overseen by a municipal notary or judge.Urban officials clearly sought to suppress the tactics described above, including evidence of their failed deployment. Marginal notes consistently accompany dismissed allegations, but only rarely do they flank an upheld charge. For instance, on 9 September 1292 thedenounced Reynario Betal for driving his oxcart through another man\u2019s field, and gave him the customary ten days to respond. Reynario appeared before the judge nine days later, along with another witness, and defended the act as a mere incursion, forced upon him because \u2018the road through which the oxen would have had to travel was neither cleared nor adequate for leading a cart loaded with hay without endangering both oxen and cart\u2019.[CITATION-116] As we have seen, judges could be aware of local conditions and reproachful of the ignorance or greed of. Yet insinuating that the violation was a result of the failure of theto carry out a major aspect of their job, namely clearing country roads, may not have been the best card to play in this case; as infrastructure specialists, thecould have authoritatively and summarily denied the claim. Reynario\u2019s rebuttal, at any rate, fell on deaf ears and the case was upheld. Contestations with similar fates must have been more common than the sources suggest, even if they seldom transitioned from oral acts to written ones,[CITATION-117] but it is impossible to tell to what degree. What they do underscore, however, is that rural dwellers developed tactics to negotiate the enforcement of urban norms, even as their appeals to urban officials such as thetended to extend the latter\u2019s power and legitimacy.The lives of urban and rural people across Piedmont became more entangled following the proliferation of cities there and elsewhere across Europe from the eleventh century and at least until the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth. While the transition from modest to intensive agricultural regimes kept rural dwellers ever attentive and responsive to environmental and political change, it forced urbanites to chart new paths to the countryside to ensure that their self-sufficiency and livelihood did not rely too much on long-distance trading. In Piedmont, instituting the field wardens\u2019 office created one tool in urban kits for pursuing these goals, a tool whose imperfections were clear on either side of city walls. The job required genuine expertise and was physically demanding, making it hard to find eligible. Rotations could consequently be shorter than statutes ordained, pushing city councils either to enforce the rules flexibly, compromise on the quality of candidates, or shift towards permanent, centralised offices. Yet the latter move in particular threatened local governance traditions and came up against scepticism and foot-dragging from within. Field wardens\u2019 compensation moreover was in principle generous but could sometimes be hard to collect, and some officials\u2019 eagerness to generate income from fines met with effective (if seldom violent) resistance, from rural dwellers and urban judges alike.Despite their evident shortcomings as rural policing agents and the many challenges they faced,nonetheless operated as regular cogs in local machineries of surveillance and discipline from at least the mid-thirteenth century, that is, the peak of pre-industrial Europe\u2019s urban growth. As attested by both the volume of charges they brought and their accumulation of knowledge about the countryside, field wardens\u2019 vigilance was constant and strong. However, even the dynamic picture of rural practices captured by their records is neither full nor accurate: its outlines were determined long in advance, reflecting urban elites\u2019 ideas on what rural order\u2014and threats to it\u2014should look like. What is more, the registers themselves were designed to perform upwards accountability as to how this order was being achieved. Finally, much of the evidence for how hinterlands were governed stems precisely from the skewed records of their disorder, shrouding the scale of compliance in ambiguous silence. At any rate, the policies thatsought to enforce became as inescapable as they were prone to being contested, throwing relations between city and countryside into sharper relief than that offered, for instance, by better-known and more commonly studied financial records and normative texts.It is this sharper relief, finally, that can provide new insights into the broader and more complex history of urban\u2013rural relations in pre-industrial urban Italy and, by extension, Europe. Specifically, the ambiguity surrounding sources relating to thebuttresses recent challenges to a traditional metrocentric, or else centre\u2013periphery, view of these dynamics as being mostly dictated by urban ascendency.[CITATION-118] The indeterminacy of urban\u2013rural power relations emerges, first, through the identification of contrarian rural voices and in/actions that shaped and responded to an urban agropolitical agenda; and secondly, by recalling that urban and rural dwellers were in fact hard to tell apart, as individuals and stakeholders vacillated between sometimes competing agendas. Indeed, field wardens could get caught up in this process, as enforcers of an urban policy who themselves had regular and perhaps pre-existing ties to the countryside, be it through family connections or as small-scale cultivators. Thus, whatever the merit of the foregoing interpretation, at the very least it illustrates that a finer-grained and more open-ended view of urban\u2013rural relations is possible, a potentiality that may stimulate further quests for and examinations ofsources and their parallels, in and beyond Piedmont. These precious registers, however, do not suffice on their own; updated studies of agropolitics, even at the micro-level, would benefit greatly from reflecting upon how interlinked local, regional and global factors shaped their dynamics, from labour organisation and cattle disease, to topography and soil quality, to systemic changes such as the advent of the Little Ice Age. Once larger datasets are created and analysed, alongside the abundant written, pictorial and material evidence for hinterland activities, these dynamics may begin to emerge in their full intricacy.",
