    "article": "This article explores the political career and writings of Richard Champion (1743\u20131791), a Bristolian Quaker and merchant who acted as a local supporter and agent of the Rockingham Whigs. It aims to recover a forgotten aspect of Lewis Namier\u2019s original ambition to understand eighteenth-century politics through the perspective of relatively ordinary people such as merchants and civil servants. However, against old Namierite assumptions, as well as much of the recent historiography on the post-1760 period in British politics which focuses on a dichotomous conflict between \u2018radical Whigs\u2019 and \u2018new Tories\u2019, this article restores the importance of the Rockingham Whigs. Importantly, it shows that a commercial Dissenter such as Champion could be fully attuned to the aristocratic and party-centred interpretation of British politics associated with the Rockinghamites and Edmund Burke, and thus encourages us to consider the idea of \u2018aristocratic government\u2019 in inclusive and eclectic ways. The case-study of Champion demonstrates that a close reading of political correspondence from the period can confirm, as well as destabilise, the Whig history of party.In 1928, Sir Lewis Namier, somewhat surprisingly considering his reputation, made a case for the study of the \u2018ordinary men\u2019 who made up the \u2018political nation\u2019.[CITATION-1] While in his own work\u2014and that of the History of Parliament project he helped to establish\u2014this came to mean researching the biographies of members of parliament, Namier originally intended the term to extend to civil servants and merchants as well as to politicians. Although some recent commentators have suggested that Namierite political history is \u2018now not much in fashion\u2019, this article argues that Namier\u2019s call for us to examine eighteenth-century politics through the perspective of relatively ordinary people is a highly valuable one, especially if extended beyond parliament and incorporating the influence of ideas and ideology.[CITATION-2] It considers the political career and writings of Richard Champion (1743\u20131791), who was a merchant and, for a brief time, a civil servant, but most importantly was a local supporter and agent of a parliamentary party, the Rockingham Whigs. The Rockingham Whig party connection has commonly been interpreted as \u2018unusually aristocratic\u2019 even by eighteenth-century standards.[CITATION-3] This may be true, but should not distract us from the fact that the connection prided itself on its association with merchant communities and city traders, and its willingness to consult them on policy. Champion has mainly been studied in relation to his position as Edmund Burke\u2019s closest supporter in Bristol during the latter\u2019s period as member of parliament for the city in 1774\u201380, or alternatively as a pioneering porcelain manufacturer.[CITATION-4] However, the two main studies of the Rockingham Whigs barely mention him.[CITATION-5] As will be shown, Champion\u2019s affiliation with this party connection was much broader and more long-standing than his relationship with Burke, important as it was. A study of Champion as a local supporter-cum-agent of a parliamentary party illuminates key aspects of eighteenth-century politics, both locally and nationally. These include the nature of extra-parliamentary political communities and identities and how they could relate to national and imperial politics, as well as to the circulation of ideas.[CITATION-6] Following Namier, the 1760s are often interpreted as a confusing decade, dominated by factionalism and personal followings rather than party and political principles, and only subsequently given ideological coherenceby the likes of Burke and Horace Walpole.[CITATION-7] Historians have recently sought to reintegrate ideas into the decade by highlighting the importance of a distinct Patriot ideology, or the clash between \u2018a new Toryism\u2019 wanting \u2018to preserve the aristocratic-oligarchic character of the British political system\u2019 on the one hand, and \u2018radical\u2019 Whiggism on the other.[CITATION-8] This article will also stress the importance of ideology, but with a focus on the aristocratic and commercial political creed of the Rockingham Whigs. The Rockingham party viewed itself as the inheritors of the old corps of Whigs, who had held power for most of the period since the Hanoverian Succession in 1714, under the premierships of Sir Robert Walpole, Henry Pelham and the Duke of Newcastle. When Newcastle was driven out of government in 1762, Charles Watson-Wentworth, second marquess of Rockingham, wrote to him to assure him of the support of \u2018all the Old Whigs\u2019.[CITATION-9] Rockingham resigned from his position as Lord of the Bedchamber to join Newcastle in opposition. After Newcastle retired from politics at the start of 1768, he let it be known \u2018[t]hat all His Friends should concur with My Lord Rockingham, in such Measures, as He shall take, for the Support of the Whig Cause\u2019.[CITATION-10] The most famous and eloquent spokesperson for these self-described \u2018Old Whigs\u2019 was Burke, but there were others who subscribed to, and helped articulate and campaign for, the principles of this party, including Champion in Bristol.As a Quaker and an urban merchant, Champion\u2019s background was similarly humble to that of the Irish self-made man Burke, as Champion often stressed in his letters.[CITATION-11] In the interpretation of scholars such as Isaac Kramnick, Champion ought to have been a wholehearted \u2018bourgeois\u2019 and \u2018progressive\u2019.[CITATION-12] Yet he was fully committed to the aristocratic ethos of the Rockingham Whigs. For Champion, the Rockingham party was the best protector of Britain\u2019s mixed and balanced constitution, because of its distance from royal obsequiousness and unrestrained popularity alike.[CITATION-13] Champion thus belonged to the largely forgotten group of Dissenting urban merchants and manufacturers who rejected \u2018radicalism\u2019 and its demands for shorter parliaments and place bills, and instead put their faith in aristocratic Whiggism. Crucially, his defence of \u2018aristocratic government\u2019 was constitutional and party-centred. It did not rest on any idea of the intrinsic quality of blue-blooded men. As he wrote: \u2018The passions of persons of therank are, at the best, like those of other men; generally speaking, they are much worse\u2019.[CITATION-14] Aristocratic Whiggism in the second half of the eighteenth century entailed a specific interpretation of recent political history, with the accession of George III being a transformative event that seemed to the Rockinghamites to compromise the Revolution Settlement by increasing the influence of the Crown and reviving Toryism. Since Namier\u2019s day, this interpretation has often been dismissed as mythology.[CITATION-15] But while the mental world of political actors rarely reflected the positions of their adversaries accurately\u2014my argument here is not that George III conspired to change the constitution or that his ministers were Tories\u2014it was nevertheless important in shaping behaviour. Since most conspiracy theories turn out to be untrue, they are often all dismissed as examples of confused thinking when, in fact, at certain times they provide the most rational explanation of complex historical problems.[CITATION-16] After George III\u2019s accession in 1760, Champion\u2019s specific brand of Whiggism was in retreat and its supporters found it exceedingly difficult to reverse the trend. The Whigs had to explain why this was the case.[CITATION-17] As a Quaker, Champion should in theory have shunned rank, but instead he viewed aristocracy as an essential constitutional principle in a similar manner to his friend (and in some ways mentor) Burke. We should note that, while he was a believer and at least periodically active in the Society of Friends, Champion was not a conventional Quaker since he was not a strict pacifist. He celebrated the legacy of Britain\u2019s imperial conquests in the Seven Years War and at least implicitly accepted the slave trade in private (although he condemned the institution of slavery in his political writing).[CITATION-18] The arming of one of his ships\u2014named\u2014for defensive purposes during the American conflict, combined with his financial difficulties in the late 1770s, appears to have led to his exclusion from the Society of Friends in Bristol.[CITATION-19] Champion merits attention not only because of his circumstances but also because of his relative articulacy. He was a literary man, fond of both reading and writing, even though he dispatched many of his own drafts to the fireplace. As a Protestant Dissenter, he was formally excluded from Oxford and Cambridge; nor was he sent to a Scottish or Dutch university, which was common among learned Dissenting families.[CITATION-20] As he put it, his merchant background committed him to a \u2018narrow Sphere of Life\u2019.[CITATION-21] He relentlessly pursued self-education, however, and was a founding member and the driving force behind the Bristol Library Society, which put great emphasis on the utility of reading among those engaged in trade and manufacturing.[CITATION-22] Champion\u2019s borrowing records at the library testify that he was chiefly interested in political and historical works, Enlightenment travel literature and classics.[CITATION-23] Moreover, he collected his own books, some of which ended up in an equivalent subscription library in Charleston, South Carolina, where he emigrated in 1784.[CITATION-24] In the 1780s, he wrote and published two extensive pamphlets setting out his political and commercial principles, one of which was translated into French.[CITATION-25] These writings will be examined in detail in later sections of this article. It will begin, however, by tracing Champion\u2019s political formation and opinions in the 1760s and his formal association with the Rockingham Whigs in the 1770s.Priding itself as the second city of England, Bristol\u2019s electorate of 5,000 was the third largest of the English boroughs, after London and Westminster. It was a so-called open constituency, in which voters and politicians were divided into Whigs and Tories long after these terms had become more confused in national politics.[CITATION-26] It was also a city in which Protestant Dissenters were not only politically active but also unusually affluent and influential. The Lewin\u2019s Mead Unitarian Chapel alone boasted eleven mayors between 1754 and 1784, representing more than a third of the period.[CITATION-27] The Whigs and the Tories in the city were represented by the Union Club and the Steadfast Society, respectively, both originally formed in the 1730s. Religious nonconformists dominated the former club. Since there are no surviving minutes of the Union Club\u2014unlike the Steadfast Society, which met frequently except during a hiatus between 1769 and 1775[CITATION-28] \u2014we cannot determine precisely when Champion joined the local Whig association. By the mid-1760s, however, when Champion was in his early twenties, he was evidently politically engaged.Champion had little difficulty in identifying the good and the bad in national politics in the early years of George III\u2019s reign. In correspondence with American business partners, he complained about Lord Bute\u2019s Peace of Paris and George Grenville\u2019s subsequent administration (1763\u20135), during which \u2018very fatal Blows were struck at the Commerce of the Empire\u2019.[CITATION-29] Champion referred chiefly to the Stamp Act, the most well-known of Grenville\u2019s colonial measures. Early on, he viewed the Rockingham ministry, which took office in July 1765, as a saving grace and identified it with the Whig cause in the shape of the Hanoverian interest.[CITATION-30] It is also worth noting that Champion, like the Rockingham Whigs in the metropole, was convinced that Bute continued to act behind the scenes after his formal resignation in 1763.[CITATION-31] By contrast, the short-lived Rockingham administration stressed that it had ceased communication with Bute, the so-called minister behind the curtain.[CITATION-32] Although Champion thought highly of Burke\u2019s speeches in parliament for the repeal of the Stamp Act, he was not himself entirely in favour of repeal. For him, it was \u2018the mode employed in the Collection of the duty\u2019 rather than the duty itself which was unreasonable. He believed that it was important to ameliorate the potentially bad effects of the repeal, and \u2018let them [the Americans] remember with Gratitude, the generous Care of Parliament for their Ease and Benefit\u2019. He realised, however, that the Rockingham ministry was compelled to repeal the Act, since \u2018Out of Doors the whole Kingdom seem to be united upon the same Sentiment\u2019. If no action had been taken, it could have led to \u2018the Resignation of the most able and best Men\u2019, which would have been disastrous, Champion emphasised in his correspondence.[CITATION-33] There are indications that he was part of the delegation of Bristol\u2019s Society of Merchant Venturers led by Thomas Farr, which was sent to London to lobby for the repeal of the Act.[CITATION-34] When Champion later established a correspondence with Rockingham and wrote of his short administration as a time \u2018when the helm of Government was guided by a steady, gentle, yet knowing hand, when Commerce flourished, and civil dissentions ceased to rage in this wide Empire\u2019, he was not expressing mere flattery but long-held beliefs.[CITATION-35] The first Rockingham ministry lasted only one year. Champion complained in the mid-1770s that the arrangement made by Chatham after the resignation of Rockingham in July 1766 \u2018put the Tories into place, [and] have enabled the [Tories] to domineer in this Country ever since, and to revive the old Scheme of making America submit to Taxation\u2019.[CITATION-36] Already in the late 1760s\u2014before Burke had published his(1770)\u2014Champion was convinced that the government\u2019s principles were \u2018tending to arbitrary power\u2019.[CITATION-37] At this time, \u2018Wilkes and Liberty\u2019 emerged as the fulcrum of the opposition.[CITATION-38] Having been arrested for seditious libel after criticising the king\u2019s speech in 1763 and declared an outlaw the following year, John Wilkes fled to France to avoid imprisonment on these grounds (and additionally for the publication of the obscene, a satire of Alexander Pope\u2019s). In 1768, he was compelled to return to England by his financial situation and sought election to Parliament to obtain legal immunity. The Grafton ministry expelled him from Parliament, but Wilkes was repeatedly re-elected and ejected as MP for Middlesex in a series of by-elections, while himself being locked up in the King\u2019s Bench prison. The whole episode led to significant unrest in London. The question of whether the House of Commons could rightfully disqualify a representative elected by the people raised constitutional questions, and commentators from many corners were eager to voice their opinions.[CITATION-39] Champion and the Rockingham Whigs sided with Wilkes.[CITATION-40] However, already at this juncture, the young Bristolian Whig was wary of the perceived extremism of \u2018Wilkes and Liberty\u2019 and the tumult associated with the movement.[CITATION-41] \u2018Whilst the people attack the violators of the laws [i.e., the ministry], they should themselves be obedient to them\u2019, he stressed.[CITATION-42] Champion was also appalled by the character of Wilkes, whose personality was disliked by many in his own camp. John Horne Tooke, founder of the Society of the Supporters of the Bill of Rights, cut off his ties with Wilkes and established a new Constitutional Society.[CITATION-43] Many of the members, especially the Protestant Dissenters, in the reformist faction disapproved of Wilkes\u2019s womanising, indebtedness and general lack of morality. It has been suggested that the Unitarian Richard Price was referring to Wilkes when he said that \u2018an immoral patriot\u2019 was a contradiction in terms.[CITATION-44] Champion shared this aversion to Wilkes\u2019s character, but he was also apprehensive about Wilkeite politics, which was supportive of political reform. As Champion wrote to his correspondents Caleb and John Lloyd, \u2018We should take care \u2026 in the midst of our just and necessary opposition to Government, not to adopt measures which may be injurious to the constitution\u2019.[CITATION-45] Thus, when Champion later wrote that \u2018The People are caught by the sound of the purity of the Constitution, and forget, that while they are cutting away a multitude of cancerous wounds, the Body is likely to bleed to Death\u2019, he was again articulating long-cherished opinions.[CITATION-46] For Champion, Whiggism entailed protecting the integrity of Britain\u2019s mixed and balanced constitution, and defending all its parts. As we shall see, he thought that this was best achieved through the instrument of \u2018aristocratic party\u2019. Opposition had to be constitutional and conducted in a legal manner within the existing framework. This could include extra-parliamentary political activity, but it must not degenerate into riot. Moreover, from this ideological perspective, political reformers who wished to alter the balance in the constitution were potentially as dangerous as George III and Bute, who he believed had increased the power of the Crown. For this reason, the American question presented a delicate problem.Champion was convinced that the legal rights of the Americans had been violated. Taxation of the Americans was against the spirit of the British constitution, according to which people could only be taxed by either their own consent or that of their representatives in Parliament, neither of which applied to the American colonists. However, the issue instigated widespread debates about reforming the British constitution and its system of representation. While the situation of the Americans required redress, Champion was unconvinced that political reform was needed in Britain. Despite his own initial activism, in December 1769 he was disparaging about the Petitioning Movement, which he believed played into the hands of the \u2018Court faction\u2019:The Leaders are in themselves so little adequate to the Task. They have assumed, and conduct themselves with such a wildness of popularity, and with so little attention to common sense, that with respect to the great point in view, the removal of the dangerous Faction at Court, which threatens Destruction to the Liberties of the whole Empire, it can have no Effect \u2026 The Plan that were [] given to us, was in the true spirit of wild and licentious popularity\u2014annual Parliaments\u2014a total exclusion of all placemen and pensioners\u2014oaths to be taken by Candidates never to accept a place, peerage or pension; and to vote for an equal Representation, destroying all the Boroughs, & encreasing the County members: a plan which in the infancy of a new state, uncorrupted by luxury or Conquest of small beginnings, & without Riches, was under sensible and good leaders, a wise and beneficial one. But in the state of England at this time was throwing a weight into the hands of ministers, securing them in their places, and affording no hopes of removal of the Court Faction.[CITATION-47] Although reform may have been desirable in principle, he emphasised that \u2018in an English Constitution alterations are difficult and dangerous, and it is better to suffer smaller Evils, than run the risque of greater\u2019.[CITATION-48] With reference to the turbulent seventeenth century, Champion highlighted the peril of political revolutions. The British owed their liberty to the Glorious Revolution, but Oliver Cromwell\u2019s military dictatorship demonstrated that political power tended to infringe on liberty. The silver lining of James II\u2019s violent measures was that they precipitated his removal. By contrast, \u2018the gradual abuse of Liberty\u2019 under Charles II had risked familiarising the people with its loss. To preserve the precious yet fragile settlement of 1688\u20139, Champion underscored the urgent need \u2018to prevent the opposition of the people in both Countries [i.e., Britain and the American colonies] from rising into a flame too difficult to be quenched\u2019.[CITATION-49] In his attitudes towards the duties of opposition and the character of Whiggism, he found kindred spirits in Burke and the aristocratic leaders of the Rockingham Whigs.Champion became seriously involved with the Rockingham Whig party through Burke, whom he supported and helped get elected as a member of parliament for Bristol in 1774. Because of the immense expense involved in election contests in a large constituency such as Bristol, the local Whigs and Tories had at several times struck agreements to nominate one candidate each, notably from 1756 until 1768.[CITATION-50] By 1774, however, the Whigs in the city had become discontented with their representative, the Irish peer Robert Nugent, Viscount Clare, who supported the government\u2019s American policy, and had become a \u2018courtier\u2019, as Champion wrote to Burke.[CITATION-51] Those Whigs who wanted to replace Clare sought another candidate. The American merchant Henry Cruger, whose father-in-law (Samuel Peach) was a prominent local merchant, had emerged as the main candidate, but Champion was suspicious of Cruger for much the same reason that he was wary of Wilkes: Cruger had \u2018not only given himself a Loose in the Youthful Follies of Life, but has at the same time preserved no Appearances\u2019. Instead, Champion and some of his friends wanted Burke as a candidate, and he described him in glowing terms:Indisputably the first literary Character in the Kingdom, he was a perfect Master of its commercial Interests. These joined to a true Knowledge of the Constitution, which he had for so many years supported with inflexible Integrity, he was the Man who would do Honor to the Cause, and whom even their Opponents must admire\u2019.[CITATION-52] That Champion began by highlighting Burke\u2019s literary reputation may not be surprising but it is still noteworthy. Champion knew of Burke not only as a politician but also as a man of letters, having been present at the committee meeting of the Bristol Library Society on 11 January 1774 when it agreed to order Burke\u2019s(1757).[CITATION-53] After the election campaign, Burke donated twenty guineas to the Library Society, and was made a member for life.[CITATION-54] It is likely that this donation was actually made by Champion and his other supporters on the committee in a bid to strengthen Burke\u2019s status in his new constituency. This is highly plausible since Burke later said that he had not spent a single penny of his own money on the election, which is reputed to have cost his campaign \u00a310,000.[CITATION-55] Champion worked tirelessly for Burke during the Bristol years. During the election itself, an associate wrote on Champion\u2019s behalf to one of his American business partners, saying: \u2018Mr. C. is so very much engaged in behalf of Mr. Edmd. Burkes Election for member to represent this City in Parliament that he has not time to write you himself\u2019.[CITATION-56] Burke was elected as the second member for Bristol with 2,707 votes, behind Cruger\u2019s 3,565 but ahead of the Tory candidate Matthew Brickdale, who received 2,456, and Clare, who had withdrawn early in the contest with only 283 votes.[CITATION-57] After Burke departed from Bristol in the wake of the election, he told his loyal supporter that \u2018I really parted from you as from friends of long standing\u2019.[CITATION-58] Champion\u2019s friendship with Burke was a decisive moment for the Bristolian merchant, as his important new friend provided him with both political and intellectual stimulation. As he later wrote:The first and greatest of my pleasures, next to that of my family, have been the result of his [Burke\u2019s] friendship. He has improved my mind, he has added to my satisfactions. He found me in a narrow and contracted Circle, and taught me to forget the little prejudices affixed to the Situation, in which my Lot was cast. Weak as I am, whatever Strength I have, I owe to him.[CITATION-59] The Champion family became close to that of the Burkes, including Burke\u2019s brother Richard, and his collaborator William Burke. Champion and his wife Judith gave what is generally considered to be the finest specimen of his porcelain manufacturing, a tea service now held at the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, to Burke\u2019s wife Jane, with an inscription in Latin which translates as \u2018to J. Burke the best of British wives\u2019.[CITATION-60] The work Champion did for Burke earned him the respect of the most senior members of the Rockingham connection, notably the Marquess himself and the Duke of Portland, who later succeeded Rockingham as the nominal leader of the party. In 1775, Champion commenced a long-standing correspondence with both Rockingham and Portland. In this correspondence, he kept the Whig aristocrats informed about local party activity and American affairs. In the early years of the American conflict in particular, he sent regular letters to Rockingham, Portland and others with intelligence he obtained through his business and family contacts in the New World.[CITATION-61] He also disseminated pro-American propaganda in Bristol.[CITATION-62] From the beginning, Rockingham expressed his gratitude to Champion for keeping him abreast of American news by giving his own views on the state of politics.[CITATION-63] Champion also informed the Whig lords of local political activity in support of the Whig opposition, for example by collecting more than 1,000 signatures for a petition to the Crown in favour of reconciliation with America. The signatories included fifteen members of the Bristol Corporation (the mayor, two sheriffs, three aldermen, and nine common councilmen).[CITATION-64] The address was in tune with the policy of the Rockingham Whigs, who had passed the Declaratory Act (1766) confirming parliamentary sovereignty over the empire during its administration, but opposed coercive methods to keep the Americans in the British fold.[CITATION-65] Within a short space of time, Champion became more confident in formulating his political opinions and analysis in lengthy letters to Rockingham and Portland. The letters were dominated by the problems caused by the American crisis for the commercial interests of Britain and especially Bristol. \u2018When the Manufacturies in general begin to fail (for some already have) \u2026 the people must open their Eyes, and emerge from their Supineness\u2019, he wrote to Rockingham on 12 August 1775.[CITATION-66] His own manufacturing business in porcelain struggled in the late 1770s, but the issue of how to make people engage with the American question was a continuous problem raised by Champion in his letters to the party leaders. From this correspondence, it is evident that he believed the Rockingham Whigs represented an intermediate position between the \u2018overgrown Influence of the Court\u2019 on the one hand\u2014now represented by Lord North\u2019s ministry nationally and supported by the Steadfast Society in Bristol\u2014and the \u2018wild popularity\u2019 of Wilkes on the national stage and Cruger locally on the other.[CITATION-67] The competition between these two extremes had led to a disastrous chain of events: the disaffection of the North American colonies, the crumbling of commerce and the onset of general languor and distrust. According to Champion, the restoration of the Rockingham Whigs to power alone could save the nation. \u2018Could this Nation but once more behold the Whig administration of 1766, it might again lift up its head to Glory and Riches!\u2019, he wrote to Portland.[CITATION-68] Being convinced that \u2018Commerce can never flourish, but under the Government of free and enlarged Minds\u2019, the key was to change both men and measures, in accordance with Burke\u2019s party doctrine set out in theEven late in the 1770s, Champion continued to blame Wilkes for giving the cause of liberty a bad name and swinging the public\u2019s favour from opposition to government, which still impeded the opposition to the American war. The general languor among the people was \u2018alarming\u2019, he wrote to Portland. \u2018Every effort of the Whigs, could not bring the People forward in Opposition, or oblige them to act with the Zeal and Resolution, which had, not long before, made those very Ministers tremble\u2019.[CITATION-69] In other words, the problem was \u2018both the System of Government, and the Disposition of the People\u2019.[CITATION-70] When informing Rockingham of the temper of the people in Bristol in 1779, he lamented that \u2018there are little hopes of rousing [the Whigs] to a Sense of their Danger, and the necessity of a warm and vigorous support of the Opposition\u2019.[CITATION-71] For Champion, this languor risked damaging consequences for the party as well as the nation. He believed that the Whigs in Bristol were deceived in believing that they were safe under a Hanoverian monarch. They failed to recognise that George III \u2018acts upon so opposite a System to the other Princes of his House\u2019 and that \u2018the present Court is composed of Men of the most obnoxious principles\u2019.[CITATION-72] During the Whig Supremacy, the Whigs had become accustomed to supporting the government in opposition to Jacobitism, and this habit was difficult to break, according to Champion. Jacobitism had a long history in Bristol.[CITATION-73] Many of the members of the Bristol Library Society were Tories, and some may even have been former Jacobites, such as William Turner, who was a member of a reputed Jacobite club that met at Nag\u2019s Head on Wine Street.[CITATION-74] For Champion, the local Whigs had not fully understood that they had to \u2018destroy the [Court] system\u2019. He told Rockingham that he had taken every measure to convince the Whigs in Bristol of the present danger and urged them to unite in an address to the king. \u2018It is a Crime to be inactive when so much is at stake\u2019, Champion wrote to Rockingham, highlighting the threat from France, which had now entered the war on the American side. He warned the party leaders that the Tories were firm and united, unlike the Whigs.[CITATION-75] Although the moderate among them might recognise the destructiveness of the present system\u2014many of the Bristol Tories were also merchants who struggled during the American War\u2014they would never promote a Whig administration because of partisanship and the memory of proscription during the reigns of George I and George II.[CITATION-76] In short, \u2018the Tories would sooner perish in the Fire which they have lighted up, than owe their Safety to Opposition\u2019.[CITATION-77] P.T. Underdown argued that Champion may not have been the most effective agent for Burke, since between 1776 and 1780 he did not advise him to visit Bristol.[CITATION-78] In these years, Burke\u2019s popularity waned in the city, as a result of his support for easing trade restrictions on Ireland.[CITATION-79] At the start of 1780, Champion predicted, accurately as it turned out, that the Tories might be able to win both of the Bristol seats, as the Whigs had done in 1774.[CITATION-80] His initial pessimism turned into cautious optimism, however, and he once again worked hard to have Burke re-elected. The main problem was that Burke\u2019s former Whig colleague, Cruger, had started to oppose Burke, and courted popular as well as Tory opinion, the latter through his friendship with the Methodist leader John Wesley (with whom he later fell out as well).[CITATION-81] For Champion, Cruger represented \u2018inconsistency\u2019:he is both Whig and Tory, American and anti-American, a strong supporter, or a violent opposer of Government, according to the Sentiments of the voters he is canvassing. He by this means has formed a strong Interest with the common People, especially amongst the Clubs \u2026 with the principal people he has, I may almost say, no Interest at all, it is so trifling.[CITATION-82] Against this background, Champion wanted to restore the settlement between the Whigs and Tories, suggesting that each party should nominate one candidate only. Despite gaining the support of many prominent Bristolians, Burke withdrew from the contest in the face of Tory strength and division among the Whigs.[CITATION-83] The Whigs lost because they not only had to contend against the Tories, but also against Cruger, who \u2018usurped\u2019 the tradesmen, in Champion\u2019s term.[CITATION-84] In the wake of the defeat, however, Champion was confident that the Whigs would be eager to make amends. He told Portland: \u2018they are now forming a select Party of the honest part of the Whigs \u2026 [convinced of] the Necessity of destroying all the corrupted parts of their Body, and consider the destruction of Mr Cruger and his friends, as the firmest Cement of the Whigs\u2019.[CITATION-85] When Cruger withdrew his candidacy in the 1780 election, Champion wrote triumphantly to Portland: \u2018The Neutrality of our friends must now convince him, how little he ought to have depended upon that vain Security, which made him act so treasonous a part\u2019.[CITATION-86] In 1784, however, Cruger was re-elected, several years after Champion had left Bristol.Champion\u2019s chief benefit from his connection with the Rockingham Whigs came in 1782 when the party returned to power in a brief administration. Burke was appointed Paymaster General (a position below Cabinet level) and named Champion his joint deputy together with his son Richard Burke Jr. However, the second Rockingham administration was even shorter-lived than the first one, as its leader died within three months of taking office. His demise split the ministry as Burke and many of Rockingham\u2019s followers resigned, refusing to serve under Shelburne. Under the new leadership of Portland in the Lords and Charles James Fox in the Commons, Burke\u2019s party, together with Lord North and his followers, brought down Shelburne\u2019s ministry the following year over the peace preliminaries which Shelburne had negotiated with the Americans. Burke and Champion returned to their previous offices in the Fox\u2013North coalition, and Portland\u2014the new torchbearer of aristocratic Whiggism\u2014was head of the Treasury.[CITATION-87] The Fox\u2013North coalition did not survive for much longer than the second Rockingham administration, being brought down by George III over regulation of the East India Company, with the king declaring that everyone voting for Fox\u2019s India Bill was his enemy.[CITATION-88] Even though Burke\u2019s plan to regulate the East India Company failed, he succeeded in carrying out at least some measures of \u2018economical reform\u2019\u2014the Rockingham Whigs\u2019 answer to the problem of the growing influence of the Crown\u2014with Champion as his deputy. The Civil List Act 1782 abolished a swathe of sinecures and court positions, the third secretary of state and the Board of Trade. It also regulated the monarch\u2019s household budget and transferred its management to the Treasury.[CITATION-89] However, Champion\u2019s own period in government, and his relationship with Burke, ended ingloriously. Champion borrowed money from someone who had been under indictment when Burke as Paymaster General reinstated this lender to office. When Burke found out he was furious because it looked as if he had done a dishonest favour for Champion.[CITATION-90] Champion\u2019s precarious financial situation made him take up a project he had considered since at least 1780: emigration to America.[CITATION-91] Burke never again corresponded with Champion after his emigration in 1784, as Burke stressed in a letter in 1791, although his close friend and collaborator William Burke did.[CITATION-92] Champion settled in Camden, South Carolina, became a naturalised American citizen and served briefly in the state assembly.[CITATION-93] In the same year he left Britain, Champion publishedwith the chief intention of proposing a method to settle \u2018the American Trade upon a liberal foundation\u2019 after American independence.[CITATION-94] The pamphlet is a forceful defence of free trade, imploring Britain not to impede the economic development of America and instead to seek to extend the two countries\u2019 commercial interactions: \u2018the more the wealth of the countries, with whom we have this particular [economic] connexion, increases, the more will flow into Great Britain\u2019.[CITATION-95] It further shows that Champion was certainly not an implacable constitutional conservative. \u2018[T]he various revolutions in our national interests have made it useful, necessary, and prudent, to make alterations in the great law of our Constitution\u2019, he wrote. \u2018And the late revolution in our commercial interests has made it equally useful, necessary, and prudent, to make alterations in the great law of our Navigation\u2019.[CITATION-96] In short, he believed that a commercial treaty could re-unite Britain and America.Champion stressed in the pamphlet that Britain need not be terrified by the prospect of mass emigration. As if to justify his own relocation in advance, he stressed that \u2018those only will emigrate, who either have not a sufficiency to make them easy, or being disgusted by disappointments, are uncomfortable at home: Or the idle, and dissolute, who are burthensome to the community\u2019.[CITATION-97] On the back of the fall of the Fox\u2013North coalition and the installation of the ministry of William Pitt the Younger, coupled with his own financial difficulties since the beginning of the American War, Champion belonged to the first category. Such emigration could be beneficial to the mother country, he stressed: \u2018whilst they quicken the diligence of those who remain behind, carry with them the name of Englishmen to the remotest parts; where the Estates which they create, will be entailed with their language and manners, upon their posterity; forming an Union that will last for ages\u2019.[CITATION-98] He changed his views on this topic in his next work. On board the ship to America he began drafting hiswhich was published in 1787. He wrote:It is a happiness, which is the envied lot of English Whigs, that there is a country, inhabited by Englishmen once fellow subjects, and always dear to them, where the laws, the language, and the manners, will preserve constantly in her remembrance, the state of their native country in her best days.[CITATION-99] Because of the \u2018deranged\u2019 condition of Britain, he now argued that \u2018great emigration\u2019 was highly probable.[CITATION-100] The final sections of this article will explain why Champion thought this was the case.Champion\u2019s political writings have received little attention from historians. D.M. Olsen\u2019s otherwise impressive biographical sketch of Champion does not mention his first extensive pamphlet and calls his second book \u2018a set of rambling letters\u2019.[CITATION-101] However, as an outline of Champion\u2019s political principles, and as an exposition of the political creed of the Rockingham Whigs, theis a highly valuable document. The work was indebted to Burke\u2019swhich Champion had borrowed from the Bristol Library Society for six days in October 1775.[CITATION-102] In the second, extended edition of his earlier, Champion had named Burke as a key influence.[CITATION-103] In the second work, written after their separation, he even proposed Burke as new leader of the former Rockingham Whig connection and a plausible candidate for \u2018prime minister\u2019, which was most unrealistic because of Burke\u2019s low rank and lack of family pedigree.[CITATION-104] However, we should not regard theas a simple regurgitation of Burke\u2019s views. As we shall see, instead of directly quoting Burke, Champion twice cited Burke\u2019s old intellectual opposite, Henry St John, first Viscount Bolingbroke.In the, Champion argued that the crisis in British politics was entirely due to the \u2018system of government\u2019 of empowering the Crown, originally conceived by Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales (the mother of George III), and put into effect by Bute and George III on the latter\u2019s accession in 1760.[CITATION-105] Burke had termed this system of government the \u2018double cabinet\u2019.[CITATION-106] As a result of this new system of government, Champion asserted, almost every administration in George III\u2019s reign had been \u2018an heterogeneous mixture of debility and insolence, tyranny and corruption\u2019, with Rockingham\u2019s and Portland\u2019s brief ministries the only exceptions.[CITATION-107] He contrasted this new system with the old, which he called \u2018aristocratical government\u2019. This \u2018old system\u2019 was \u2018maintained by a combination of the whole of the landed property, and all the great family interests of the Whigs, as well as by the principal monied men\u2019.[CITATION-108] Under this system:[t]he Administration was selected from the principal Whig families, who all concurred in the support of the person placed at the head of the Treasury, to whom they were generally united by long habits of attachment. All the other officers were made properly subordinate to, and dependent upon, his department. They yielded to him the rank of first minister, and shewed an example to their fellow subjects in the deference and respect which they paid to him.Since the monarch did not have any direct power in his or her person, \u2018that excellent maxim in the Constitution, \u201cthe King can do no wrong,\u201d was holden [] sacred\u2019. The first minister\u2014Champion\u2019s models were clearly Walpole and Pelham\u2014was then held responsible for all measures of government, and \u2018grounded his strength upon a majority in the House of Commons\u2019.[CITATION-109] The old system presupposed a strong opposition as a necessary control on the government, and it was the parliamentary opposition, rather than the monarch, which could overthrow an administration.[CITATION-110] Because of the Jacobite leanings of the Tories, the Hanoverian monarchs were compelled to put their faith exclusively in the Whigs, and were thus obliged to diminish their own personal power.[CITATION-111] Champion highlighted that this circumscription of royal power coincided with the most prosperous period in Britain\u2019s history.[CITATION-112] One of the difficulties of this Whig interpretation of Hanoverian politics is to square the alleged triumph of Tory principles under George III with the disappearance of the Tory party as a coherent parliamentary bloc at around the same time. The country gentlemen rump of those who remained Tories tended to support George III\u2019s governments, but not indiscriminately, and some of them sided with the opposition on questions such as the cider tax, general warrants and even the dispute over seating Wilkes as MP for Middlesex. Roger Newdigate, MP for Oxford University, wrote: \u2018I like the King and shall be with his ministers as long as I think an honest man ought, and believe it best not to lose the country gentleman in the courtier\u2019.[CITATION-113] Champion had accused the North administration of being Tory, but the key point was that North had pursued Tory policies which were supported by old Tories in the shape of the Steadfast Society in Bristol.[CITATION-114] As he wrote, \u2018The Whigs, having been in possession of the administration for near fifty years, were so much masters of the elections, that, notwithstanding almost all the Parliaments of this reign have acted in obedience to the new system they have consisted\u2019.[CITATION-115] George III was persuaded that extinguishing the great Whig families would open the door to talents who had previously been excluded from government.[CITATION-116] In the wake of his accession, connections were broken and \u2018[d]esertion from party became frequent\u2019.[CITATION-117] Only the friends of Rockingham remained united, amounting to seventy or eighty members in Champion\u2019s estimation. Moreover, the opposition to the American war was restricted to Rockingham\u2019s party, according to Champion, who had privately lamented that Chatham did not act consistently in concert with the Rockingham Whigs.[CITATION-118] Parliament was dominated by the \u2018King\u2019s friends\u2019, supported by the Bristol Tories. For Champion, the aristocratic Whig system\u2014whereby the monarch was a mere figurehead of government and his or her business was carried out by ministers of birth, wealth and weight, fully attuned to the opinion of Britain\u2019s trading and manufacturing interests\u2014was thus a counterweight to the new system of government which had triumphed since George III\u2019s accession. Paradoxically, the aristocratic Whig system had the ability to ensure that the popular element of the constitution retained the upper hand against the monarchy, without becoming all-powerful: \u2018It is the especial duty of ministers, acting upon Whig principles, in this limited monarchy, and who are responsible, not so much to the sovereign as to the people,to address a king with truth, simplicity, and firmness\u2019.[CITATION-119] In short, a powerful, independent aristocracy was the solution to the general political crisis identified by Champion, and people should rally behind this form of true Whiggism, rather than the \u2018wild popularity\u2019 of Wilkes and Cruger, and the politics of reform and agitation.One of the characteristics of Champion\u2019s politics is its rather austere nature, which is understandable considering his Quaker background, but is not what is usually associated with either the Rockingham Whigs or with Britain\u2019s commercial cities.[CITATION-120] He complained,, that \u2018[o]ur eating formerly, though equally plentiful, was much plainer and cheaper\u2019.[CITATION-121] Like John Brown\u2019s best-selling(2 vols, 1757/8), Champion diagnosed a decline in British manners, although he believed it to be a more recent phenomenon than Brown had claimed.[CITATION-122] \u2018The change of living within these last twenty years has produced an entire change of manners\u2019, Champion wrote: \u2018Their natural jealousy, susceptible of the smallest national affront, has totally forsaken them\u2019.[CITATION-123] As we have seen, Champion had complained about the inactivity and lethargy of the people for much of the 1770s in his correspondence with the Whig leaders. He now suggested that it was due to the spectre of luxury, which he appears to have understood conventionally as excessive individual consumption.[CITATION-124] The similarity between Champion and Brown should not be overstressed, since the latter blamed the era of aristocratic government and the Whig supremacy under the first two Georges, which Champion celebrated as an age of commercial prosperity and constitutional equilibrium. But their common ground went beyond mere rhetoric. For both, luxury symbolised what was wrong with modern Britain. In private, Champion called luxury \u2018the greatest evil in a growing State\u2019.[CITATION-125] At the start of the Seven Years War, the general conduct of the nation had been \u2018manly\u2019 (that is, virtuous), but after the influx of wealth in the wake of this successful imperial war, manners changed markedly. The central problem was Britain\u2019s transformed position on the Indian subcontinent. In this context, Champion undoubtedly drew on the expertise of Burke, whom he had served when Burke had delivered his famous speech on Fox\u2019s East India Bill in 1783.[CITATION-126] Champion singled out the Battle of Plassey of 1757 as the transformative event which had turned the East India Company into a sovereign power.[CITATION-127] From this time on, Champion stressed that \u2018the greater part of their servants acted no longer in the station of traders\u2019.[CITATION-128] This had far-reaching consequences, not only for India but also for the British metropole:Happy would it be for a people, could the distribution of its riches be confined within proper bounds! But such were the effects of the plunder of the East in corrupting our manners, that we very soon made a rapid stride from the laudable improvements to the most corrupt and licentious conduct.[CITATION-129] The return of wealthy Company servants (the so-called \u2018nabobs\u2019) to England could see them overthrow the influence of the traditional aristocracy, as, for example, when Lord Ilchester and Lord Shaftesbury found it too expensive to hold onto their electoral interest in Shaftesbury after 1771.[CITATION-130] For Champion and Brown alike, patriotism\u2014understood as selfless devotion to the common good\u2014was the antidote to the corrupting influence of new wealth. The one-time Tory and Country party spokesperson, Bolingbroke, had popularised this term in his opposition to Walpole in the 1720s and 1730s, when he wrote his \u2018Letter On the Spirit of Patriotism\u2019 (1736) and(1738). David Armitage has traced the persistent influence of Bolingbroke in reformist circles.[CITATION-131] It is equally clear that his writings retained their standing among more moderate Whigs such as Champion, even though Burke had begun his writing career as a satirist of Bolingbroke.[CITATION-132] In, Champion cited Bolingbroke\u2019s, which had been serialised in thein 1733\u20134, in the epigraphs to two key chapters dealing with the national debt and \u2018the state and principles of the different parties\u2019, respectively. In the first case, he quoted Bolingbroke\u2019s warning that the public debt had increased the power of the Crown and the potential for parliamentary corruption, and in the latter a more general complaint about \u2018universal corruption\u2019.[CITATION-133] Champion\u2019s citations underline that Burke\u2019s later condemnation\u2014\u2018Who now reads Bolingbroke? Who ever read him through?\u2019[CITATION-134] \u2014referred only to Bolingbroke\u2019s philosophical and religious writings: his political writings continued to be widely read.The wealth of modern Britain was \u2018superficial\u2019 because so much of it was fuelled by debt, complained Champion, who was not above railing against the \u2018the merciless fangs of the monied man\u2019 in a Bolingbrokean manner.[CITATION-135] Burke later adopted the same language in the(1790).[CITATION-136] The \u2018Country\u2019 and \u2018Patriot\u2019 framework fits with Champion\u2019s diagnosis of Britain\u2019s ills as resulting from excessive indebtedness, public as well as private. The national debt had perhaps been temporarily beneficial when the Jacobite threat was still potent, according to Champion, but in the long run, it had been positively injurious: under the system of perpetual debt financing, Britain\u2019s manufacturers and merchants were burdened \u2018with taxes to maintain a vast body of idle people, who live upon the labour of the hive\u2019.[CITATION-137] In short, Champion regarded the monied interest as \u2018a dead weight upon the community at large\u2019.[CITATION-138] After Bolingbroke, patriotism became synonymous with constitutional opposition to government, and was chiefly associated with the Country party platform which opposed the increasingly centralised and powerful British state, financed by the national debt.[CITATION-139] The Rockingham Whigs self-evidently had Court Whig roots, but as a long-standing opposition party they had resorted to Country party arguments and tactics.[CITATION-140] This explains at least partly why some of those previously classed as Country Tories became associated with the Rockingham Whigs, including Sir William Meredith and William Dowdeswell, as well as independent Country politicians such as Sir George Savile.[CITATION-141] It also clarifies why some associated Burke with Bolingbroke, despite Burke\u2019s own dislike of the Tory statesman-cum-philosopher. When the bookseller Thomas Davies published a new edition of Bolingbroke\u2019s political writings in 1775, he dedicated the work to Burke. Davies associated patriotism with constitutional opposition in the context of fears about the growing powers of the Crown, as well as public protests. \u2018A British Senator, like you, will not flatter either Prince or People: he only is a true Friend to both, who supports, to the utmost of his power, the prerogative of the crown, and the rights of the people, as they are fixed by the laws of the land\u2019, he concluded his dedication.[CITATION-142] For Burke and the Rockingham Whigs, \u2018economical reform\u2019\u2014intended to make the legislature more independent of the executive\u2014was a more suitable undertaking than political reform.For Champion, it did not appear contradictory to promote commercial development and free trade while bemoaning the nefarious influence of luxury, despite his own professional background in high-end manufacturing, illustrated by the tea service he gave to Burke\u2019s wife. The Quakers\u2019 heavy investment in tea and chocolate products, as drunk from Champion\u2019s porcelain, was intended to provide an alternative to alcohol with its dangerous effects. Moreover, producing domestic porcelain could reduce dependence on imports from the East which swelled the East India Company\u2019s profits (though the tea they also drank undermined this ambition). Quaker attempts to square modern politeness with frugality were further reflected in the split in their ranks over the theatre in Bristol, which many of them viewed as a frivolous amusement. As Olsen has shown, previous scholars, by confusing Champion with his uncle, wrongly assumed that he campaigned against the opening of a theatre in the city in the 1760s, when he may in fact have been involved in the establishment of one along with his fellow Quaker Joseph Harford. But in 1773, possibly under pressure from the Society of Friends, he did organise a petition to prevent the licensing of a new theatre in the city.[CITATION-143] In any case, Champion would have disagreed with Bernard Mandeville, for whom it was impossible to cultivate both frugality and the arts and sciences.[CITATION-144] Champion was worried that the possession of luxury led to contentment and could retard the industriousness which enabled prosperity. His pamphlet on American trade shows his acute concerns about the prospect of economic decline in a sweeping and largely inaccurate world-historical perspective: \u2018We are wearied with the desolation of the rich and beautiful regions of Asia, and of the East, so full of people in ancient times, but now almost depopulated by their ferocious Masters\u2019.[CITATION-145] In the same pamphlet, he warned that the young American republic \u2018ought to be founded in examples of frugality, not of luxurious enjoyments\u2019.[CITATION-146] But this did not stop him claiming that Britain could profit from trade if the Americans pursued superfluities rather than necessities.[CITATION-147] For all his enlightenment, Champion thus suggested that trade in luxuries could be a zero-sum game in which the seller was the evident beneficiary. Betraying the influence of Montesquieu\u2019s terminology, Champion argued that luxury was more pernicious in a republic, which needed virtue, than in an absolute monarchy, in which honour was the ruling principle.[CITATION-148] In general, however, Champion\u2019s ideas were part of the second \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 debate among \u2018moderns\u2019 about luxury, between the partisans of \u2018unregulated\u2019 and those of \u2018well-ordered\u2019 luxury, siding with the latter camp.[CITATION-149] He did not think that virtuous states needed to be poor. Champion paid lip service to a fundamental distinction between modern and ancient people\u2014a notion Benjamin Constant would immortalise in the following century\u2014describing the latter as more \u2018sanguinary\u2019 and \u2018dissolute\u2019, and motivated by \u2018a spirit of conquest\u2019.[CITATION-150] For Champion, the \u2018mildness of Christianity\u2019 had transformed modern people. Yet, he stressed that the parallel of the fall of Rome remained instructive: \u2018Rome was then, what Great Britain is now, in a very willing disposition to receive a master\u2019.[CITATION-151] Britain\u2019s activities in India demonstrated that the influx of Eastern luxury was founded on \u2018ferocious conquest\u2019 in Bengal rather than.[CITATION-152] London could thus be compared with Rome at its sacking, but rather than barbarian invaders, the threat came from \u2018domestic and civil commotions\u2019, illustrated by the Gordon Riots in 1780. \u2018Had not the military arrived at the very instant in which their fate seemed to be suspended in a doubtful balance, the great and opulent city of London would most probably have been plundered and destroyed\u2019, Champion reflected.[CITATION-153] In summary, the aristocratic Whig and Country party traditions were blended in Champion\u2019s politics under the joint influence of Burke and Bolingbroke, with a tinge of the austerity and pessimism chiefly associated with John \u2018Estimate\u2019 Brown. Champion\u2019s political writings thus exemplify that the dialectic between virtue and corruption was often left unresolved in eighteenth-century political discourse.This article has demonstrated that Champion provides a useful case-study for investigating the interactions between local and national politics in Britain in the second half of the eighteenth century. Through his links with Burke, as well as his lesser-known interactions with Rockingham and Portland, and through his nearly forgotten pamphlets on politics and political economy, he furnishes a noteworthy example that demonstrates the importance of analysing politics under George III beyond the radical\u2013conservative dichotomy.[CITATION-154] Champion\u2019s career shows that one dimension of the post-1760 political landscape can be understood as aristocratic Whiggism in opposition to the dual threat of George III and his ministers on the one hand, and the growing political reform movement on the other. These political strands represented three competing readings of Britain\u2019s mixed and balanced constitution, one dominated by party and the aristocracy, one Court-centred and one concentrated on the people. All of them claimed to uphold the integrity of the constitution\u2014with reformers clinging onto ancient constitutionalism[CITATION-155] \u2014but they disagreed on how the mixture and equilibrium in the constitution should be interpreted and protected.Namierite historians have dismissed the notion that George III was a constitutional innovator as a figment of Burke\u2019s imagination, which became an obsession of the Rockinghamites.[CITATION-156] Shifting attention away from the Rockingham Whigs, James Vaughn has recently observed in a learned and valuable study that the general trend of \u2018New Toryism\u2019 was only \u2018briefly interrupted in July 1766 with the formation of the Chatham administration\u2019, the government which succeeded Rockingham\u2019s.[CITATION-157] But for Champion, the real interruption took place with the formation of the Rockingham administration in 1765. In contrast with Vaughn\u2019s interpretation, Champion believed that the Chatham administration completed the Tory victory, since it split the Whigs. The anti-party \u2018not men, but measures\u2019 catchphrase of Chatham produced, in the words of Burke, an administrationso checkered and so speckled; he put together a piece of joinery, so crossly indented and whimsically dovetailed; a cabinet so variously inlaid; such a piece of diversified Mosaic; such a tesselated pavement without cement; here a bit of black stone, and there a bit of white; patriots and courtiers, kings friends and republicans; whigs and tories; treacherous friends and open enemies \u2026 indeed a very curious show; but utterly unsafe to touch, and unsure to stand on.[CITATION-158] In some ways, then, the case of Champion confirms certain aspects of the Whig interpretation of eighteenth-century politics, and this article has shown that private correspondence between party leaders such as Rockingham and Portland and local agents such as Champion can reinforce the Whig history of party as well as destabilise it. Champion\u2019s published works in the 1780s reiterated and crystallised themes he had written about in his political correspondence for over a decade. This does not mean that the Whig interpretation of eighteenth-century politics captures. It is merely one perspective, and an ideologically charged one. But while modern research has demolished the notion of a revived Tory party at the national level after the accession of George III, the label had greater resilience in certain localities.[CITATION-159] Most importantly, the idea of a revived Tory party was vital to theof many Whigs, both nationally and locally, and is better understood as the partisan perspective of the vanquished rather than pure mythology.[CITATION-160] Champion\u2019s viewpoint illustrates that aristocratic Whiggism remained a plausible ideology among Protestant Dissenters and merchants in one of Britain\u2019s major commercial cities in the latter decades of the eighteenth century. This provides an important qualification to much of the historiography, which tends to emphasise the egalitarian nature of non-conformity.[CITATION-161] In general, historical studies are inclined to focus on extremes rather than the middle ground.[CITATION-162] Champion may be a single example, and sometimes an idiosyncratic one, but his connections and relative articulacy make him a highly interesting case-study. It shows that the alleged failure of the Rockingham connection to develop a positive ideology which appealed beyond the parliamentary cadre was not as complete as the Namierites believed.[CITATION-163] Thanks to the politics of people such as Champion, this form of aristocratic Whiggism was not extinguished. The call for reform within the Whig family certainly started to make itself felt in the 1760s and 1770s, reflected by the Rockinghamites\u2019 espousal of \u2018economical reform\u2019. John Brooke argued that Burke\u2019s failure at the polls in 1780 demonstrates the electoral weakness of aristocratic Whiggism.[CITATION-164] Champion\u2019s failure to activate the Whigs in Bristol confirms this view to an extent. However, aristocratic Whiggism continued to be the focus of the parliamentary opposition, and the hope of prominent Whigs in Bristol, as represented by Champion. In the years of opposition after 1784, following Champion\u2019s emigration to America, the Portland Whigs, despite losing the support of the Bristolian Union Club in 1784, had more supporters in parliament than the Rockingham Whigs had had. After the election of 1790, approximately 145 MPs out of 183 members of the opposition belonged to the Portland\u2013Fox connection.[CITATION-165] The French Revolution split the \u2018old Whigs\u2019, initially via the division between Burke and Fox in 1791, later by William Windham\u2019s breakaway \u2018Third Party\u2019, and then decisively when the Portland Whigs entered into a coalition with Pitt in 1794.[CITATION-166] While nineteenth-century Whigs lamented the split between Fox and Burke, and Fox became synonymous with Whiggism, they continued to regard Burke as providing the intellectual foundations for the still-important ideal of aristocratic independence under the banner of the Whig party.[CITATION-167] Champion shows that the idea of an aristocratic party could resonate beyond the nobility, since it rested on a theory of politics to which many commercial Dissenters were wedded.Finally, what does this tell us about Namier\u2019s \u2018political nation\u2019 with which this article began? While Champion personifies the resilience of aristocratic ideals, and to some extent confirms part of the hierarchical framework associated with J.C.D. Clark\u2019s revisionism,[CITATION-168] he also encourages us to think about these ideals as more eclectic and surprisingly inclusive in ways that chime with much of the finest British political historiography of recent years.[CITATION-169] Above all, his political and intellectual life is testimony to the value of investigating the past through the prism of ordinary people\u2019s experiences and outlooks.",
