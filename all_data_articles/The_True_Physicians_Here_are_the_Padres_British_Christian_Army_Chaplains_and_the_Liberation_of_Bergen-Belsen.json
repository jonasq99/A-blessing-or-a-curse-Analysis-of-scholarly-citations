    "article": "When a senior medical officer summarised the work of army chaplains in the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, he said: \u2018The true physicians here are the padres, and they are doing more good to the patients than anyone else\u2019. Chaplains, however, have been largely absent from the extensive scholarship on Belsen. Similarly, widespread interest in post-Holocaust Christian\u2013Jewish relations has ignored the accounts of those Christians who encountered the aftermath of the Holocaust in the liberation of the camps. This article shows that chaplains fulfilled a unique role at Belsen, providing pastoral care which encouraged survivors as they shared their stories. This process of listening was the first encounter of British Christian ministers with the realities of the Holocaust as experienced by its survivors. As a consequence, they differ from most contemporary British narratives of Belsen in their appreciation of the Jewishness of the experience: they largely recognised survivors as Jews and sought to understand the specific nature of Jewish suffering. Finally, this article shows that chaplains recorded their experiences and displayed a sensitive approach to survivor testimony, ensuring not only that a wider audience learned the truth of the liberation of Belsen, but that those accounts were defined by the experiences of the Jewish survivors themselves. The article concludes that the experience of Christian chaplaincy in the liberation of Belsen uncovers a singular example of Christian\u2013Jewish encounter in the aftermath of the Holocaust, one in which Christian ministers demonstrated a profound care for survivors, their identities and their stories.When the Second World War came to an end in Europe in May 1945, the Rev. David Stewart initially found himself with \u2018ample spare hours\u2019 relaxing \u2018under the trees of [an] orchard\u2019.[CITATION-1] \u2018Occasionally\u2019, Stewart later wrote, \u2018a visiting officer would talk of Buchenwald and Belsen\u2019.[CITATION-2] Both concentration camps had been liberated by Allied forces in mid-April, followed by other camps in Germany and Austria. Belsen\u2019s liberation in particular had confronted British society with stark images and descriptions of a Nazi concentration camp.[CITATION-3] Despite the rush of newsreel from the camps, Stewart\u2019s peace appeared at first to be unaffected: \u2018We listened a little sceptically\u2019, he said.[CITATION-4] Such scepticism was not to last, however, as Stewart soon encountered the reality of a liberated camp for himself, being sent on 14 May to Bergen-Belsen with 35 Casualty Clearing Station, to which he was attached as an army chaplain. Writing in July after he had left the camp, he declared that \u2018I shall tell only what I know is true \u2026 in conveying to my public the things I have seen with my eyes and heard with my ears. In short, the barest truth\u2019.[CITATION-5] Stewart committed himself to sharing what he witnessed as a chaplain with a medical unit which cared for survivors of Belsen. But in the seventy-five years since the liberation, the experiences of Christian army chaplains have been neglected and do not feature in the principal histories of Belsen.[CITATION-6] And yet, scholarship has explored different categories of liberator and witness: the medical teams, soldiers, journalists and film crews, even war artists, have all been studied for their roles at Belsen and how they responded to what they encountered there.[CITATION-7] Mark Celinscak briefly studied chaplains, not as their own category of analysis, but alongside Belsen\u2019s medical teams, as part of a group of \u2018padres, doctors, nurses, and additional medical personnel\u2019.[CITATION-8] His wider purpose was to restore understanding of the Canadian role in the liberation of Belsen, not to reveal new stories of British liberators.[CITATION-9] Chaplains were non-combatants and they had specific duties of care, distinct from the work of the medical teams. They were Christian ministers who had volunteered for war service and who confronted for the very first time the realities of the Nazi genocide of the Jews; they should not be included in the military and medical responses because their experience at Belsen and their resources for responding were very different from those of both combatants and other non-combatants. Christian army chaplains constitute a distinct category for understanding how British participants witnessed the liberation and understood the experiences of the survivors they encountered.Where historians have previously referred to the work of chaplains, they have largely focused on the role of Jewish chaplains, namely the Reverends Leslie Hardman and Isaac Levy.[CITATION-10] Both men wrote book-length memoirs of their experiences at Belsen, both became well-known members of the Anglo-Jewish community and were later appointed as rabbis of Hendon and Hampstead United synagogues respectively, and, as the large majority of survivors of Belsen were Jewish, it is appropriate that this is where historians have begun.[CITATION-11] However, at least thirty British Christian chaplains, attached to both combat and medical units, either witnessed the liberation, were involved in post-liberation care of survivors, or visited the camp at some point in the immediate aftermath.[CITATION-12] These included T.J. (Thomas James) Stretch, a Church of England priest from Fishguard in Pembrokeshire, who was one of the first chaplains to enter the camp. He was interviewed by a news reporter and wrote a short report from within Belsen itself.[CITATION-13] Michael Morrison, the Roman Catholic chaplain to 32 Casualty Clearing Station, who was at Belsen from 17 April to 27 May, wrote letters to the head of the Irish Jesuit Order in Dublin and published a book chapter about his experience.[CITATION-14] This article discusses two major accounts of chaplaincy at Belsen that have not previously been studied. John Ross was the Church of Scotland chaplain to a Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment brought in from 19 April to 24 May to support relief efforts. David Stewart, the Church of England chaplain to 35 Casualty Clearing Station, arrived later, on 14 May, and supported a hospital at Belsen until his unit was moved on 18 June. Both Ross and Stewart wrote detailed accounts of Belsen which have only recently been deposited in archives.[CITATION-15] As the Christian chaplains at Belsen have been largely neglected by historians, piecing together the evidence of their story has its challenges. Chaplains\u2019 letters have the immediacy of being written in the midst of the liberation and post-liberation care.[CITATION-16] Some post-war accounts, such as Edmund Swift\u2019s, composed as late as 1989, could be influenced by decades of post-war reflection on the events.[CITATION-17] In contrast, the reports written by Stretch and Stewart in 1945 are revealing in their immediacy, reflecting conversations with survivors and including detailed quotations, recorded soon after they occurred.[CITATION-18] Some Roman Catholic chaplains focused their care on the minority of Catholic survivors of Belsen. Others\u2014those who spent a longer period of time in the camp and prioritised pastoral care and survivor testimony\u2014were able to understand more of the Jewish survivors\u2019 experiences and were therefore better equipped to transmit these particularities when they came to respond. Language, too, was a challenge for those involved in the liberation and could have limited their understanding. But some chaplains overcame this barrier because they spoke German, while others relied on survivors as interpreters, or on the intercession of their Jewish chaplain colleagues\u2014both Hardman and Levy spoke Yiddish.By exploring what Christian chaplains did at Belsen, how they interacted with survivors and how they responded to the experience, three principal conclusions can be drawn. First, chaplains developed a particular form of pastoral care through which they encouraged survivors to share their stories of persecution. Second, as a consequence of listening to these stories, chaplains recognised and were able to articulate the Jewish identity of the majority of those they met, and understood the distinctiveness of Jewish suffering under Nazi persecution. And finally, this attention to survivors and their stories characterised how chaplains responded to the experience of witnessing the camp for themselves and how they reported on Belsen to a wider audience.Restoring Christian chaplains to the history of Belsen contributes to three critical areas of historical study. First, their pastoral care for survivors gives a new insight into an important aspect of the post-liberation rehabilitation of Belsen survivors and demonstrates how army chaplains adapted their understanding of their own responsibilities in such unique circumstances. The neglect of Belsen has been a significant omission in studies of army chaplaincy in the Second World War.[CITATION-19] Secondly, this study contributes a new understanding of Christian responses to the Holocaust, demonstrating that when Christian ministers encountered for themselves the individuals who had experienced the realities of Nazi persecution, they were more likely to comprehend the specific anti-Jewish nature of Nazi policy. Although the question of how far their understanding was disseminated is unclear, these chaplains\u2019 responses add nuance to the conclusions of historians such as Tony Kushner and Tom Lawson, who have pointed to the example of the Church of England to conclude that the revelations from the Western concentration camps did not alter British society\u2019s inability fully to appreciate the anti-Jewish nature of Nazi persecution.[CITATION-20] Finally, in analysing for the first time the written records of the chaplains themselves, this study provides new evidence of immediate post-liberation recognition of the importance of survivor testimony, challenging what David Cesarani called the \u2018myth of silence\u2019, the suggestion that survivor experience was absent from the narrative following liberation.[CITATION-21] In sharing testimony, some chaplains reveal a degree of sensitivity to some women\u2019s experiences of sexual violence during the Holocaust, for example, suggesting that some chaplains understood how Nazi persecution was experienced in distinct ways by women\u2014an aspect of the Holocaust which even in historical scholarship has only relatively recently been given due attention.[CITATION-22] As the only major Nazi concentration camp liberated by British forces, Bergen-Belsen has a particular place within the British memory of the Holocaust. This was evidenced by the prominent part played in the 2020 UK Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony by the Belsen survivor Mala Tribich and the British liberator Ian Forsyth, who shared their remembrances alongside one another.[CITATION-23] But the experiences of participants such as Christian chaplains have been left untold. It is important to restore chaplains\u2019 experiences to the historical record to enable a new understanding of both the liberation of a Nazi concentration camp and Christian responses to Jewish identity and experience in the immediate aftermath of the Holocaust.Eight days after his arrival at Belsen, T.J. Stretch was interviewed bywhile standing next to a partially filled mass grave. \u2018This morning\u2019, Stretch said, \u2018we buried over 5,000 bodies. We don\u2019t know who they are. Behind me you can see a pit which will contain another 5,000. There are two others like it in preparation\u2019.[CITATION-24] The image of chaplains standing over the graves of Belsen\u2019s victims was deeply powerful in framing the public understanding of Belsen and in associating chaplains with these mass funerals. A photograph of Michael Morrison praying over a mass grave was published on the front page of the Catholic newspaperon 4 May 1945, the paper\u2019s first reporting of the news of the camp and its liberation.[CITATION-25] John Ross was filmed saying his own prayers over a mass grave.[CITATION-26] Ross\u2019s daughters recall that a family friend saw the newsreel in Palestine, watching in the cinema with a Jerusalem audience. Surrounded by Jews, many of them seeing footage of the Holocaust\u2019s aftermath for the first time, Ross\u2019s friend jumped from his cinema seat and shouted: \u2018There\u2019s Jack!\u2019[CITATION-27] This narrative\u2014which firmly linked chaplains with burials\u2014has defined historians\u2019 assumptions about the role of chaplains at Belsen. As Mark Celinscak concluded, in the initial period of the liberation, \u2018there was not much time to complete additional tasks\u2019.[CITATION-28] Undoubtedly, in the typhus-ridden environment of newly liberated Belsen, burials were one of the most pressing of chaplains\u2019 duties. But chaplains did far more at the camp than saying prayers over mass graves. From their arrival they took responsibility for one of the relief teams\u2019 five core priorities, which had been laid out by Lieutenant Colonel Gonin, commanding officer of 11 Light Field Ambulance: \u2018To help those who lived to regain their humanity\u2019.[CITATION-29] Chaplains moved beyond what was usually expected of them in wartime and developed a particular pastoral role which focused on supporting survivors to talk, to be listened to and thus to regain their strength for the future.The roles chaplains were expected to play during the Second World War can be traced through official chaplaincy publications.[CITATION-30] The Deputy Chaplain General, Percy Middleton Brumwell, wrote in 1943 that the army chaplain was a \u2018source of inspiration and good cheer\u2019 to men in the front line. Chaplains, in his assessment, could have an impact on victory in battle because \u2018[v]ictory in the day of battle will depend on morale\u2019, something chaplains were well placed to influence through preaching and visiting men in the front line. But war was not all about morale and victory. Michael Snape has argued that in comparison with the First World War, chaplains serving between 1939 and 1945 undertook a far greater degree of \u2018personal welfare work\u2019, primarily in terms of the pastoral issues facing the men with whom they were serving.[CITATION-31] However, official publications could not prepare army chaplains for what confronted them when they entered Belsen in April and May 1945. Morrison estimated that when he arrived at Belsen on 17 April with 32 Casualty Clearing Station there were between 7,000 and 10,000 dead bodies lying out in the open or in their huts.[CITATION-32] In the report which T.J. Stretch wrote at Belsen, dated 23 April, he noted that a week after the first troops entered the camp, people were still dying and bodies were still unburied: \u2018Yesterday, I went round the camp with a Doctor who commands a Hygiene Section. We estimated that there were over 2,000 bodies lying on the ground\u2014there will be more tomorrow\u2019. He added that \u2018tomorrow, with a Roman Catholic and a Jewish chaplain I am burying over 4,000 people in a communal grave\u2019.[CITATION-33] Compared with the usual expectations of chaplains in wartime these were unprecedented responsibilities: chaplains\u2019 training provided guidance for the burial of individual, named servicemen, not mass burials of atrocity victims.[CITATION-34] Neither their prior experiences of the horrors of war nor rumours of other Nazi camps could prepare chaplains for the realities they faced at Belsen, as David Stewart\u2019s initial scepticism about reports from Belsen and Buchenwald indicated.[CITATION-35] As well as duties to the dead, however, chaplains had responsibilities to the living. Catholic chaplains exercised particular responsibilities for the Catholic former inmates they discovered at Belsen. Morrison described how in his first twelve days he buried around 13,000 dead. But \u2018[t]hose thirteen thousand took up very little of my time as two graves took five thousand each\u2019.[CITATION-36] Instead, he considered that his responsibilities to the living were of even greater significance. He anointed hundreds with holy oil.[CITATION-37] He said Mass, and before he had left Belsen he was able to report to the Jesuit authorities in Dublin that \u2018all Catholics had received Holy Communion at least once\u2019.[CITATION-38] That Morrison wrote about these things to his superiors in the Jesuit Order suggests something of how he viewed Belsen specifically through the lens of a Catholic priest: he had a special duty to ensure that Catholics received the Sacrament.Even in the midst of their other duties, pastoral care became the overriding responsibility of the chaplains at Belsen. Ross demonstrated how his clerical and pastoral responsibilities were inherently linked. An officer in Ross\u2019s regiment noted that the chaplain had established an \u2018Inquiry Bureau\u2019 which enabled survivors to begin to try and make contact with their former homes and the families from whom they had been separated.[CITATION-39] Ross emphasised, however, that this was more than simply an administrative department or post office. By acting on survivors\u2019 enquiries, Ross participated in the first urgent task facing Jews following liberation: to get \u2018back to their homes and united with friends they have left, if they can be found\u2019.[CITATION-40] The particular religious tasks of a Roman Catholic chaplain were also often conceived in pastoral terms. Herbert Welchman, the senior Roman Catholic chaplain to 8 Corps, described administering the Last Rites. He said that it \u2018was most touching to see the gratitude of these poor souls for the consolations of their religion of which they had been deprived so long\u2019.[CITATION-41] Welchman\u2019s words implied that in performing the responsibilities of a Catholic priest he was not simply fulfilling everyday religious obligations but was restoring a sense of normality for survivors, enabling practices which gave them solace and helped reclaim their identity, and thus providing care for their well-being.Edmund Swift demonstrated how, in pursuing his Roman Catholic duties, his status as a chaplain encouraged survivors to begin to tell him their personal stories. He arrived at Belsen at the end of April, and on his first day he accompanied Morrison around the camp, \u2018both of us carrying the Blessed Sacrament\u2019.[CITATION-42] Swift\u2019s first task was to find Catholic survivors and fulfil Catholic obligations; but immediately, he was drawn into conversation with survivors themselves. On arrival, a French survivor gave him DDT to allow him to enter the disease-ridden camp safely. The survivor, according to Swift:suddenly noticed that under my tunic I was wearing a stole. \u2018Oh are you a priest?\u2019 he asked in surprise. And then for fifteen to twenty minutes he gave a graphic description of the outrageous treatment they had all received and the atrocious sufferings and degradation to which they had been submitted.[CITATION-43] Similarly, for Stretch, Ross and Stewart, attention to pastoral care was a significant feature of their work at Belsen. In July 1945, when Stewart published his account of his experience, it was the doctor in command of his unit, Lieutenant Colonel A.M. Campbell, whom he asked to provide the foreword. Campbell, one of the most senior medical officers at Belsen, praised the chaplains\u2019 work at the camp: \u2018No greater tribute can be paid to their work than was uttered by one of the medical officers\u2014\u201cThe true physicians here are the padres, and they are doing more good to the patients than anyone else\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-44] Chaplains were intimately involved with the care of survivors, but they were not simply absorbed into the same work as the doctors and nurses. The doctors and nurses saved lives\u2014Campbell said that medical treatment brought survivors back to \u2018normal health and sanity\u2019\u2014but the chaplains, according to Campbell, through \u2018sympathy, kindness, and understanding\u2019, helped to give survivors \u2018the will to live\u2019.[CITATION-45] Ross summed up his duties in this way: \u2018[w]e had been trained to kill and destroy, now we were helping to save and rebuild\u2019.[CITATION-46] He gave a detailed account of the diverse work undertaken at Belsen, describing the procedure of DDT dusting; survivors \u2018waiting outside to see the Jewish padre with one of their numerous problems\u2019; burials; meals being prepared in the cookhouse and the accompanying food distribution process; washing in the bath-house; sanitary arrangements; and hospital care.[CITATION-47] He was, then, not just to be found standing over graves conducting burials or confined to one particular job in one particular area of the camp. Instead, his close involvement with so much of the relief work at Belsen enabled Ross to hold conversations with survivors. This is evidenced in the knowledge he demonstrated in his report, written soon after the war, regarding conditions in the camp; he was able to share what survivors had told him about their treatment at the hands of the SS guards, detailing \u2018some of the facts which were corroborated by many witnesses\u2019.[CITATION-48] Of all the chaplains at Belsen, David Stewart articulated at greatest length his concentrated process of committed pastoral care. Communicating with the aid of a German\u2013English dictionary and English-speaking survivors who acted as interpreters in the hospital wards, and working in collaboration with his unit\u2019s other chaplain, T.J. Davies, Stewart described his regime of care as a \u2018determination to understand the needs of the patients\u2019.[CITATION-49] In his retelling, this commenced on the patient\u2019s arrival in the hospital, with a smile and then \u2018a single [ventured] word\u2014\u201cHullo\u201d\u2019, to which the reply was \u2018a skinny hand\u2019 which reached out to his.[CITATION-50] Stewart understood his purpose as being \u2018to induce our patients to talk of their experiences and to help them to realise that they need never again fear the recurrence of those evil things\u2019.[CITATION-51] He encouraged survivors to recollect their experience and to articulate it to him, and in doing so he thought that survivors could build a connection between their life before the catastrophe and their life to come.[CITATION-52] Stewart believed that the pastoral support he offered also contributed to survivors\u2019 physical recovery. After numerous meetings and conversations with Marieka, a young Polish woman from Warsaw, conducted with the help of her English-speaking friend who served as interpreter, Stewart wrote that:One day I told Marieka\u2014\u2018If you could only straighten your legs, you could walk.\u2019 So she began to make the effort. Every day she forced her knees down, ignoring the pain, until she could do it twelve times. In a fortnight, she was able to stand. In another week she walked.[CITATION-53] The period of time cited by Stewart, and the photograph he published of Marieka with the caption \u2018Standing for the first time in four months\u2019, suggest that he was deeply involved in her care.Stewart described another of his patients as \u2018the girl who did not want to live\u2019. Her name was Magda, and when Stewart first encountered her in the hospital she would lie in bed, pretending to sleep, refusing to speak to anyone. Another survivor, Marika, who spoke English and acted as interpreter, told Stewart that it was because \u2018[s]he doesn\u2019t want to get better. She prefers to die\u2019.[CITATION-54] This seems to have emboldened Stewart, who the next day went to speak to her. He remembered the conversation:\u2018What do you want to talk with me about?\u2019\u2018I want you to tell me about yourself.\u2019\u2018There is nothing to tell. I am just a Jewess. From Hungary. My family is dead. I am alive, unfortunately. There is no one in the world to care whether I live or die. It would be better for me to die, for I think God himself has surely forgotten me.\u2019\u2018No, Magda, God has not forgotten you. And there are many who will be glad you lived.\u2019She gave a short bitter laugh.\u2018Who are they?\u2019\u2018People you will meet when you go back into the world again.\u2019\u2018But if I don\u2019t go back, I shall not meet them and how can they be glad or sorry?\u2019\u2018Well, I shall be very glad if you get better.\u2019 \u2026Bit by bit she told me about herself \u2026 I brought several other girls to see her, taking care to choose those with a cheerful nature and firm character. To my joy, one of them became her fast friend. She, too, had no relations. When I left Belsen she was convalescing rapidly.[CITATION-55] Though articulated only from his side of the conversation, by spending time with Magda, encouraging her to talk, and by being there to listen, as chaplain Stewart participated in the first stage of her recovery.At liberated Belsen chaplains therefore carried out diverse tasks which went beyond initial mass burials and which sought to provide pastoral care for survivors. This challenges the existing assumption that liberators treated survivors with \u2018shock, bewilderment, and lack of understanding\u2019.[CITATION-56] The medical teams, according to historian Johannes-Dieter Steinert, made little allowance for the emotional needs of survivors and thought little of the \u2018lifelong consequences of the recent trauma\u2019.[CITATION-57] But chaplains could respond to survivors differently. They demonstrated a level of pastoral responsibility which was concerned both with the physical recovery of survivors and also with addressing the long-term psychological impact of the trauma the survivors had experienced.It is difficult to judge the extent to which chaplains\u2019 pastoral work was a success. Nevertheless, in sharing his narrative of chaplaincy, Stewart demonstrated something of his own development in response to hearing survivors\u2019 stories. At the beginning of his report the survivors were anonymous and they were victims: \u2018the inmates were louse-ridden, emaciated and helpless. The living slept in the huts with the dead\u2019.[CITATION-58] However, by the end of his account, Stewart was demonstrating a relationship with individuals who had names, stories, relatives, a painful past, but also the possibility of a future. They were no longer anonymous victims who were all the same; now they were Hanka, Julia, Sara, Vera, Genia, Susie, Klara, Marieka, Magda, Eirena, Blanca, Anna, Guta, David. In this way, Stewart showed how, in listening to survivors\u2019 stories as a form of pastoral care, chaplains could engage with the survivors as individuals, and, in most cases, this meant they could begin to have some understanding of those survivors\u2019 Jewish identities.Contemporary narratives of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen often contained few references to Jews and Jewish experiences of persecution. Historians have explored how the context of the liberation in the last weeks before Germany\u2019s final defeat obscured knowledge of the eastern death camps such as Auschwitz. It has been suggested that Belsen was absorbed into what was already known about pre-war camps and not understood for its place within the escalation of Nazi persecution. The extent of the horrors revealed there meant that Belsen became the ultimate evidence of the evil of Nazism. The timing of its liberation close to the end of war in Europe contributed to its swift adoption as the symbol of the British role in defeating such evil.[CITATION-59] Joanne Reilly has noted that few of the soldier liberators of Belsen were able to comprehend something which was so horrific and therefore they could not understand its place within anything wider that would become known as the Holocaust.[CITATION-60] The Jewish story was neglected.Examining the experience of Belsen through the eyes of Christian army chaplains has allowed us, in the previous section of this article, to see how far the chaplains committed themselves to the pastoral care of survivors and interacted with them. Even then, Michael Morrison still referred to survivors in mass numbers. Describing the survivors he encountered when he arrived at the so-called \u2018Horror Camp\u2019, Morrison wrote that \u2018about fifty thousand people were herded\u2019 into it.[CITATION-61] But was this how all chaplains encountered the survivors of Belsen, or did others consider survivors as individuals and, specifically, as Jews? In examining how they articulated their interactions, it becomes clear that most chaplains had some understanding of the Jewish identities of Belsen\u2019s victims and the particular suffering of the Jews in Nazi Europe.Of the more than 60,000 people alive in Belsen at the time of its liberation, around two-thirds were Jews.[CITATION-62] In fact, there were more Jewish survivors of Belsen than of any other concentration camp liberated by the western Allies.[CITATION-63] Yet when British observers responded to reports of Belsen, the Jewishness of the camp, its victims and its survivors was mostly absent from the narrative.[CITATION-64] Scholars have generally agreed that for the liberators and for British society more widely, Belsen was a universal, not a Jewish, experience. Tony Kushner has argued that \u2018the ambiguities of liberalism\u2019 characterised the context in which the British conceived of the persecution of the Jews: in other words, an attitude of \u2018liberal universalism\u2019, which opposed \u2018religious/racial intolerance\u2019 but which could not comprehend \u2018Jewish\u2019, meant that the Jews were absent from British reports of Belsen.[CITATION-65] Tom Lawson has maintained that for the Church of England the ambiguities of liberalism were articulated in a Christian framework: war with Nazi Germany was a war for Christianity itself.[CITATION-66] When the concentration camps were liberated, this narrative was ultimately unaffected: the camps were evidence of Nazi anti-Christianity, not antisemitism. For example, Lawson quoted the, the leading Anglican newspaper, which in August 1945 blamed the \u2018secularisation of society\u2019 for the atrocities.[CITATION-67] When theis compared with other church newspapers, it is clear that the attitude of the Church of England was replicated across other Christian denominations. The Catholic press failed to recognise the liberation of Belsen as evidence of the persecution and attempted destruction of the Jewish people. The first report in thewas headlined \u2018Westminster Mass For German Torture Camp Victims\u2019. The article announced: \u2018There will be a Solemn Requiem Mass in Westminster Cathedral at 12 noon on Monday, April 30, for the repose of the souls of the victims who have died in German concentration camps\u2019.[CITATION-68] There was no room in this report for Jewish victims. The Mass at Westminster Cathedral was reported on the front page of the Catholicon 4 May. The paper reported that in the congregation \u2018[t]he Poles, probably the chief sufferers from Nazi cruelty were largely represented \u2026 They were mourning death and cruelty not so much to soldiers, who accepted the risks, but to men and women like themselves, whose main crime was that they resisted un-Christian domination\u2019.[CITATION-69] Catholic readers in Britain, therefore, absorbed a view of Belsen which was largely understood in national, Christian and, specifically in the Polish case, Catholic terms, without room for an understanding of antisemitism, Jews and the Final Solution.It is important to recognise, however, that historical analysis of this Christian\u2013Jewish interaction in the wake of the Holocaust has primarily focused on the accounts of those who did not witness the concentration camps for themselves. Once eyewitness testimony is integrated, these conclusions become complicated. For example, Russell Wallis\u2019s work on British prisoners of war has challenged the conclusions of Kushner and others that liberal universalism prevented the Allies from recognising the Nazi treatment of Jews. Wallis has demonstrated how those British soldiers who witnessed the persecution of the Jews at first hand, working as prisoners of war alongside Jewish forced labourers, or encountering Jews on forced marches in the latter stages of the war, for example, understood far better the particular place of Jews within Nazi ideology.[CITATION-70] Restoring chaplains to the historical record also allows us to assess the Christian response to the Holocaust in the light of the accounts of individuals who actually witnessed something of the consequences of Nazi persecution. In encountering the realities of Belsen, chaplains, as Christian ministers, were prompted to respond differently to the Jewishness of the experience. As in the case of British prisoners of war, this suggests that those non-Jews whom circumstances placed alongside Jewish survivors for sustained periods of time were able to understand more of the experiences of Jews in comparison with those who either encountered survivors only briefly or who formed a narrative from a distance. A context in which they were intimately involved in Jews\u2019 welfare enabled many chaplains firstly to identify survivors as Jews and, secondly, to understand something of the uniqueness of Jewish suffering in the Nazi catastrophe. Moreover, in recognising for themselves the Jewish experience of Belsen, chaplains wanted others to understand this too.The Jewish chaplains who witnessed Belsen, of course, could not fail to see survivors as Jews. Leslie Hardman was the first Jewish chaplain to arrive at Belsen. He wrote movingly of the first encounter between Jewish survivors and a rabbi from the liberating forces. One spoke to him in Yiddish:[A]nd I spoke to them in the same language. I don\u2019t know what I said, but my words had no more effect on them than my appearance. Then the girl pointed to the Magen David on my tunic, and they came forward cautiously, one by one, and peered. Slowly, almost reluctantly, recognition reached their tired, tormented minds.[CITATION-71] As a rabbi, identified by his Star of David and communicating in Yiddish, the common language of much of Eastern European Jewry, a Jewish chaplain was able immediately to form a powerful emotional connection with Jewish survivors. For Hardman, entering Belsen\u2014and confronting the realities he found there\u2014was an intensely Jewish experience.[CITATION-72] Christian chaplains at Belsen gained a better understanding of the victims\u2019 identities through their frequent interactions with their Jewish colleagues. Describing his first burial service, Hardman recalled standing by the graveside with a Protestant chaplain. Hardman asked his fellow chaplain whether he would like to pray first. Hardman recorded the Protestant chaplain\u2019s response:[H]e said it would be more fitting if I did so, as most of the dead were Jewish. And so, with bursting heart, the salt tears coursing down my cheeks, I said the prayers for the dead \u2026 Then the Protestant padre said his prayers, and the three of us stood with bowed, uncovered heads. As we left the grave I was still crying, and my companions, too, were deeply moved. My fellow padre turned to me, saying, \u2018There is very little I can do here. Most of the people are Jewish, and I cannot talk even with those of my faith, as I do not know the language. You are needed, you must stay.\u2019[CITATION-73] Even if this particular Protestant chaplain could not communicate in English with survivors, the experience of standing over a mass grave and witnessing his colleague\u2019s deep emotional response and spiritual connection with those still living in the camp emphasised to him that the majority of the victims and survivors of Belsen were Jews. There was no attempt to impose Christian understanding or language at this moment, only a deep and moving respect for Jewish suffering, grief and survival. It is a powerful image of Jewish\u2013Christian interaction in the stark aftermath of the Nazi catastrophe.In many more cases, Christian chaplains identified survivors of Belsen as Jews. Stretch made a real effort to try to understand who the victims of Belsen were. \u2018[W]ho are these people who have suffered so much?\u2019, he asked and then answered himself: \u2018We don\u2019t know; nobody knows\u2019. Stretch listed some of the \u2018crimes\u2019 for which the survivors had apparently been interned: listening to anti-Nazi broadcasts, speaking out \u2018against the state or against Hitler\u2019 and being \u2018underground workers in occupied countries\u2019. Others, Stretch emphasised, \u2018belonged to different races and creeds; they were Poles or Jews\u2014that was their only crime\u2019.[CITATION-74] Here, Stretch demonstrated that in the midst of his work at Belsen he was reflecting on who the victims were and why they were at Belsen. Although his conclusion displayed some universalism, he did acknowledge that, for many of Belsen\u2019s victims, it was their Jewishness which had singled them out for persecution. When John Ross first entered the camp, he encountered a group of girls who had only recently arrived at Belsen. \u2018The majority of them were Jewesses\u2019, he wrote, \u2018\u2014French, Czech, Hungarian and German\u2014who spoke several languages and were now acting as interpreters for the British\u2019.[CITATION-75] He identified survivors by nationality but before doing so emphasised their Jewishness. Later in his report he was even clearer: of those in the camp, \u2018[c]ertainly 60% at least were Jews\u2019.[CITATION-76] David Stewart was equally unequivocal: \u2018A very large proportion of the internees were Jewish, of German, Polish and Hungarian origin\u2019.[CITATION-77] Indeed, the identities of the survivors whose stories Stewart published were not anonymous: where relevant he clearly affirmed the fact of their being Jews.[CITATION-78] It has been noted, however, that Roman Catholic chaplains carried out some specifically Catholic roles at Belsen, such as administering the Last Rites to the dying. In some cases this limited Catholic chaplains\u2019 opportunities to reflect on the Jewish identities of survivors. Michael Morrison, the first Roman Catholic chaplain to enter the camp, did not mention Jews in any of his writing about the experience. In his first letter from Belsen, dated as early as 18 April, he described the victims as \u2018dead civilians\u2019. Already he was focused on his duties as a Catholic to Catholics: \u2018Administering the sacraments is very difficult as none of the people speak English and no record of religion is kept\u2019.[CITATION-79] A more detailed letter describing his work at Belsen, written on 11 May, referred to patients in the hospitals as \u2018Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Russians, French, Belgians, Dutch\u2019, and not as Jews and non-Jews.[CITATION-80] Similarly, Morrison\u2019s published account of Belsen, which appeared in 1947, made no mention of Jews. He wrote that in Camp 1, the \u2018Horror Camp\u2019, \u2018[i]t is very difficult to assess the number of Catholics but it must have been about 30%\u2019.[CITATION-81] Clearly Morrison was aware that the vast majority of victims and survivors were non-Catholics, but he did not feel any need to qualify this non-Catholicism with the word \u2018Jews\u2019. Another Catholic chaplain, Herbert Welchman, visited Belsen as early as 17 April. In his memorandum on his visit he also made no reference to Jewish victims. Instead, he spoke of Poles and French and particularly emphasised a group of Frenchmen who \u2018were overjoyed when they heard that a British Military Chaplain was coming to live in the camp and that they would be able to attend Holy Mass and the Sacraments. They proudly produced their tattered prayer books and said that they had used them daily\u2019.[CITATION-82] The challenging language barrier which Morrison experienced may have been a factor, but it is also possible that he did not make reference to the Jewish identities of the majority of Belsen victims because he was writing for a Catholic audience; perhaps he felt that it was the details about Catholics, and not Jews, which Catholic readers wanted to hear. Welchman\u2019s experience also suggests that he sensed an urgency in his own responsibilities as a Catholic priest to fellow Catholics. The introduction to, an edited collection of experiences of Catholic chaplains during the Second World War, in which Morrison\u2019s account of Belsen appeared, described Catholic chaplaincy duties narrowly as being \u2018for the specific purpose of ministering to the spiritual and moral needs of Catholic personnel in the Army\u2019.[CITATION-83] It is not surprising, then, that in the extreme circumstances of Belsen, Morrison and Welchman persisted in seeking out Catholics to whose needs they could continue to minister.However, this approach was not representative of all Catholic chaplains at Belsen. Morrison entered the camp in the very early stages, when there were Catholics dying around him. The need to administer the Last Rites and anoint the dying and the dead, in his role as spiritual caregiver, was urgent. Catholics who arrived later and spent more time in Belsen, however, did identify some victims as Jews. Vincent Fay, for example, entered Belsen on 27 April with 9 British General Hospital and was stationed there until 17 June. In letters written from the camp he described the administering of the Sacraments to Catholic survivors but he also stated of the survivors that they were \u2018of every nationality especially Poles, Russians, Czech-Slovaks and many Jews\u2019.[CITATION-84] George Galbraith, who entered Belsen with the Vatican Relief Commission in Europe, was quoted at length by thein September 1945. The editorial line again strongly emphasised the Catholic and Polish victims, especially those who had been priests. The headline was \u2018Priests\u2019 Death Roll in Horror Camps: Scottish Chaplain Reports From Belsen\u2019 and the lead read: \u2018Fr. Galbraith informs us that 80 priests, mostly Poles, died in this compound and that in Dachau 1,200 priests died, 800 of whom were Polish\u2019.[CITATION-85] Galbraith himself, who wrote of the time he spent in the hospitals at Belsen, contradicted the editorial line and emphasised that despite the national mix, most people in the camp were Jewish: \u2018The camp was cosmopolitan. Poles in large numbers, Dutch, Belgians, Italians, Czechs, Slovenes, Yugoslavs, Hungarians, Austrians, Greeks, German, French. The Jewish element predominated. 80 per cent Jews\u2019.[CITATION-86] Edmund Swift first encountered survivors of Nazi persecution at what he called the \u2018Bremen Concentration Camp\u2019 and which was most likely the Bremen-Farge sub-camp of Neuengamme. He recalled that the survivors \u2018were all Europeans, and from their response towards us appeared to be all Catholics. We anointed them all\u2019.[CITATION-87] Of Belsen, however\u2014where Swift arrived on 14 May, staying for two weeks and returning on 28 June until leaving for good on 9 August\u2014he reported that \u2018[a]mong the Belsen prisoners Jews were predominant\u2019.[CITATION-88] Swift\u2019s account also demonstrates that chaplains did not simply identify victims and survivors of Belsen as Jews but also understood something of the particular nature of the Jewish experience of Belsen. As an interesting addition to Galbraith\u2019s report for the Vatican Mission, Swift added that one of the Mission\u2019s key clerical roles was to gather information from Jewish survivors \u2018about relations and friends, and whether they were already dead or perhaps still alive but in some unknown locality\u2019. The information was collected by Vatican staff and it \u2018thus became possible for families to be reunited or at least to learn what members of the family were still alive and where they might be found\u2019.[CITATION-89] In undertaking this task, chaplains learned about the particularities of the Jewish experiences, above all the severe displacement wrought by the Nazi persecution.Other work conducted by chaplains also helped them to understand the uniqueness of the Jewish experience of Belsen and of Nazi persecution more widely. John Ross ran what he called an \u2018Interview Room\u2014answering questions, dealing with requests and complaints etc. etc. and running a kind of Post Office for those who wanted to write letters\u2019. He noted that his office was shared by a Jewish chaplain: \u2018He could speak German and most of our clients were Jews but I, of course, had to have an interpreter \u2026 We had a very fine Hungarian Jewess and her daughter of twenty working with us and she had a wonderful way of dealing with our callers\u2019.[CITATION-90] This work\u2014the interactions with Jewish survivors, the close working relationship with the Jewish chaplain and Jewish interpreters\u2014suggests that Ross had numerous opportunities to understand the Jewishness of Belsen.The Jewish chaplain with whom Ross shared an office was most probably Leslie Hardman. The latter recalled that \u2018I had been given the use of a small room which served me as an office. Here hundreds of people came to seek my help\u2019, for example in tracing lost loved ones.[CITATION-91] The sort of insights which Ross might have learned from sharing a close working environment with Hardman, who was himself dealing with so many Jewish survivors and their families, can be gleaned from a conversation Hardman reported having with other British officers in the camp. His colleagues were finding it difficult to empathise with the survivors. \u2018Be patient\u2019, Hardman advised them, \u2018these people are not just sick recovering from an illness; they have not just been pardoned for any crime or holding some political idea \u2026 They have been subjected not only to a deliberate extermination of themselves as a people, but to a disintegration of their souls\u2019.[CITATION-92] Hardman made it clear to his colleagues that this was not simply a horror camp but evidence of the Nazis\u2019 attempted destruction of the Jewish people. This was the understanding which Christian chaplains could obtain from working with their Jewish colleagues.Engaging on a pastoral level with survivors was another important way in which chaplains could understand the Jewish experience both at Belsen and earlier. Large numbers of the Jews at Belsen were survivors of the forced death marches from Auschwitz and elsewhere in the winter of 1944\u20135.[CITATION-93] They had survived many of the realities of Nazi persecution beyond the horror of Belsen itself. David Stewart wrote that \u2018[o]ne could always detect the Jewish patients by the number neatly tattooed on their forearms. This was done on their arrival at their first Concentration Camp\u2019.[CITATION-94] Although not all Jews were tattooed at Auschwitz, the majority of those with tattoos were Jewish. Stewart\u2019s reference to \u2018first\u2019 concentration camp implies some understanding of the long experience of continued, repeated, escalated persecutions enacted against the Jewish people by the Nazis and their collaborators. Belsen was not simply a detention centre for political opponents, nor was it the only camp where Jews had suffered.In one testimony Stewart told the story of a teenage boy called David. He was clearly deeply moved by his relationship with David and shared something of how the boy would \u2018sit and gaze out of the window and say nothing\u2019 on his numerous visits to Stewart\u2019s office. After reflecting on this, Stewart then said: \u2018There does not seem to be any peace for the Davids of this world\u2019.[CITATION-95] Perhaps Stewart meant that there was no peace for children on whom the horrors of war had had an impact. But is it simply a coincidence that this young Jewish boy held the name of the foundational Jewish King David? Is it possible that here Stewart was actually saying that through his experience he saw something of how there had been no peace for the Jews as a people as a whole? Perhaps, being a David himself, Stewart especially identified with him. Either way, it suggests a degree of solidarity with the survivor. Nowhere did Stewart\u2014or indeed any of the Christian chaplains studied\u2014exhibit evidence of antisemitism, use of anti-Jewish stereotypes or attempts at conversion, all things which, although not universally practised in the Church of England of the time, were nonetheless widespread.[CITATION-96] Stewart did not force his own faith on the Jews he met, nor did he minimise their experiences or seek to diminish their faith and identity. He appears to have respected them as Jews. As we have already seen, when one Jewish survivor, Magda, told him that she thought that \u2018God Himself surely has surely forgotten me\u2019, Stewart responded: \u2018No, Magda. God has not forgotten you. And there are many who will be glad you lived.\u2019[CITATION-97] T.J. Stretch, like Stewart, demonstrated some understanding of the wider Jewish experience across Europe. Rather than simply associating Belsen with Nazi persecution and Nazi persecution with Belsen, he was aware that Belsen was only part of the story. He recognised that the dead he encountered \u2018are a small portion of the great unknown number who have been systematically killed by the Nazis\u2019.[CITATION-98] Tony Kushner has noted that in contemporary accounts Belsen was often portrayed as the very worst example of Nazi atrocities\u2014Auschwitz was absent; and, particularly in the later Belsen trials, British accounts of the evidence were emphasised over and above Jewish voices.[CITATION-99] But chaplains complicate this narrative: because they interacted with survivors, they learned about what survivors had suffered, not just at Belsen but also elsewhere.Not only did chaplains gain some understanding of Jewish experiences of Nazi persecution, in some cases they were committed to communicating these experiences to a wider audience. Edmund Swift shared how one Czech Jewish woman talked to him in distressing detail about the gas chambers and crematoria of Auschwitz. One of her companions interrupted her and said: \u2018Ugh! Let us not talk about all this frightful business. It is now passed. Let us put it behind our backs and forget all about it\u2019. But the first woman replied: \u2018No my dear, we must talk about it. We must let the world know howhave been treated, and whathave been through\u2019.[CITATION-100] Swift\u2019s account of Belsen was written in 1989, decades after the events he described, but if accurately remembered, this particular anecdote illustrates both how Swift took note of Jewish experiences of persecution and that he continued, many years later, to agree with the survivors he had met: the world should know how \u2018they\u2019, the Jews, had been treated. And unlike Swift\u2019s, Ross\u2019s account was written soon after the war. Stewart\u2019s account was published just months after he left Belsen. Stretch wrote in the camp, a week after the first Allied troops entered. Thus, survivors\u2019 Jewish identity was not just something which chaplains later considered in the context of post-war reassessment of the Christian\u2013Jewish relationship; they did so inside the camp itself as a reaction to the circumstances in which they encountered survivors themselves and, crucially, survivors\u2019 stories.The question remains, then, as to why Christian chaplains responded so differently from other eyewitnesses at Belsen in their understanding of something of the Jewish experience of the camp. Joanne Reilly has claimed that for the liberators, Belsen was \u2018not a particularly Jewish tragedy but a human one\u2019.[CITATION-101] The very fact of being present at Belsen, therefore, was not enough to convince liberators of the Jewishness of the majority of the victims and survivors. There appears to have been something more specific about the role of the chaplain, which means that many of them did not conform to the established British narrative of Belsen as a universalist horror. The distinctions between chaplains\u2019 accounts suggest that there was no simple Catholic/Protestant divide to explain differences in reporting. On a personal level, it was what chaplains did in practice\u2014and how they thought about their presence at the camp at the time and afterwards\u2014which enabled them to recognise the Jewishness of survivors. Because chaplains approached survivors as individuals and listened as survivors bore witness, they had the opportunity to understand them as Jewish victims and as Jewish survivors.Tony Kushner has said that the silence of some when it came to the Jewishness of survivors was \u2018not accidental\u2019.[CITATION-102] If this omission was deliberate, then stating the Jewishness of survivors was not accidental either. Chaplains chose to articulate and to seek to understand the Jewishness of those they met because they saw survivors as people with individual stories. Indeed, they told others about survivors\u2019 identities because they wanted others to learn. In expressing his reasons for recording his experience at Belsen, John Ross wrote that he hoped to \u2018awaken and keep alive our sympathy for all, Jews and Gentiles alike, who have suffered during this war and before it, immeasurably more than we have\u2019.[CITATION-103] Ross stated that there are lessons for everyone, but he singled out Jews for particular mention because his experience at Belsen taught him something of the uniqueness of Jewish suffering under the Nazis and the necessity of \u2018our\u2019 sympathy. For Ross, identifying victims of Belsen as Jews was not just a matter of telling something of the truthful reality of the experience. Acknowledging that victims were Jews should lead to a response: it motivated sympathy and inspired a change in the Christian attitude towards Jews. It also shaped how chaplains wrote about their experience in order to help others understand what they had witnessed.At the beginning of his report on Belsen, T.J. Stretch reflected on how, and whether, he ought to tell others of the experience:I don\u2019t know whether I ought to write this. Something seemed to tell me that many may say it is a flight of my imagination; others may say that at least there is a semblance of truth in what I write, but that I have laid on the colours much too thickly. But for all that, I feel it ought to be done \u2026 This is so ghastly a story that the whole world should know about it.[CITATION-104] Though they found it difficult, it was in writing that chaplains first felt able to articulate their response to Belsen. They were concerned to tell the truth of the camp, what they knew of its history and the conditions for its inmates, and, most interestingly, some chaplains shared the testimony of survivors themselves. In so doing, chaplains at Belsen provide a powerful corrective to the claim that \u2018no one was interested in the testimony of the survivors\u2019 and considerably supplement more recent work on those who sought to preserve the stories of those who had survived Belsen.[CITATION-105] Chaplains recorded their encounters with survivors and these interactions formed the basis of their response to Belsen in the initial period following the camp\u2019s liberation.Chaplains\u2019 first justification for writing concerned the imperative of telling the truth. When Stretch wrote his report, he signed and dated it \u2018T.J. Stretch C.F. [Chaplain to the Forces], Belsen Camp, April 221945\u2019 in an effort to establish the authenticity of his account.[CITATION-106] Just days after the camp was liberated Stretch was eager to state the truth of what he had witnessed, and his effort to record this truth was reinforced by what he did with the report. Stretch did not write for his family or friends; he wrote for a wider audience. The report was dictated to his batman and several copies were made. One was sent to Stretch\u2019s superior, the Assistant Chaplain General, John William Jackson Steele, who, recognising the importance of Stretch\u2019s account, sent it on 2 May, along with a report by the Jewish Chaplain Isaac Levy, to all senior chaplains. Indeed, in his memorandum which accompanied Stretch\u2019s and Levy\u2019s accounts, Steele\u2014who himself visited Belsen\u2014also acknowledged the importance of telling the truth of Belsen: \u2018As it was impossible to arrange for all chaplains to see this camp, these two papers may give you the atmosphere of an eye witness account \u2026 I hope it will allow you to judge the accounts that have appeared in the newspapers and to appreciate their true worth\u2019.[CITATION-107] In this way, Stretch\u2019s response was circulated, read and absorbed, alongside a Jewish account, by other Christian clergy serving in the British armed forces. At least one such chaplain, Bryan Isaac, kept his copy of Stretch\u2019s report for the rest of his life.[CITATION-108] Even more than this, Stretch\u2019s report reached a still larger audience because it was sent to theand was quickly published in this mainstream Christian newspaper later in May 1945.[CITATION-109] Part of Stretch\u2019s intention was therefore not just to tell the truth but also to ensure that the Church at large\u2014and Christians\u2014would know what he had witnessed.Similarly, David Stewart articulated his sense of purpose in telling others the truth about the experience of Belsen. His account was written just a few weeks after leaving the camp. The report was published as a pamphlet and included a number of his own photographs. In his opening reflection, Stewart outlined his objective, writing that the experiences of the survivors he met \u2018entered so deeply into my soul that forever I cannot forget\u2019 and that in the account that followed \u2018I have tried to draw a picture of what I know to be the truth\u2019.[CITATION-110] John Ross, too, commented on his need to inform others. In his report, he recalled writing home to his family when the \u2018Horror Camp\u2019 was burned on 21 May 1945.[CITATION-111] In all these examples there is a clear sense that these chaplains recognised the importance of telling others about their experience in the immediate aftermath. Neither Stretch nor Stewart nor Ross wrote about the rest of their war service. Belsen had such an impact on them that it was this alone that they felt others needed to understand.It is important, then, to consider what truths the chaplains wanted others to hear. Dramatic, horrific details were not absent from the narratives they told. In the early part of his account, Stewart wrote: \u2018There is a shocking ugliness in the thin whimpering of a man who is longing for the relief which death alone can give; the gasping screams of a woman in the throes of dysenteric cramps \u2026 At Belsen, these things were a commonplace\u2019.[CITATION-112] Examples of potentially sensationalised language in Stewart\u2019s account are, however, almost always instances where he was describing the early days of the liberation, something he himself did not witness, since he arrived at Belsen on 14 May. Where his account is impersonal or graphic in tone, this reflects the observations of others. His accounts of his own experiences are far more personal, and his encounters with survivors displayed a deep sense of respect, such as his response to a non-Jewish Polish patient who wept at the realisation that she would never see her mother again. To this, Stewart wrote: \u2018What could one say in the face of such grief as that? Here was sacred ground\u2019.[CITATION-113] Even if the horrors were occasionally voiced, most chaplains\u2019 accounts of Belsen were not sensationalised or overly dramatised but were attempts to establish a factual record. Edmund Swift used fifteen pages to outline its location, the story of the liberation and the conditions which survivors experienced, writing for example of the \u2018half a litre per day\u2019 of soup to which inmates were restricted.[CITATION-114] As chaplains to the hospitals, Swift and Fay were particularly determined that their readers should understand the conditions which patients experienced.[CITATION-115] In his report, Ross took his readers with him as he described the camp, writing, for example: \u2018In order to give you some idea of what the camp itself was like, I am going to ask you to visit it with me now. We enter through the administrative block at the main entrance.\u2019[CITATION-116] Similarly, Stretch shared details of the survivors he met, including their ages and insights into their experience, noting, for example, that a \u2018girl who spoke to me had been there for six months; she had been in another camp for six months and before that, in prison for one year\u2019. He directed readers\u2019 attention beyond Belsen to other camps, writing that \u2018some internees say it is not the worst camp by any stretch of imagination\u2019, thus broadening the understanding of readers back home that Nazi persecution was about more than the horrors of Belsen. The way Stretch wrote was also deeply affecting, addressing his readers directly and involving them in responding to Belsen: \u2018Can you imagine your children living in such surroundings?\u2019, he asked.[CITATION-117] His account was not merely descriptive; he shared the details with an intention to initiate a response from others, just as he, too, had been forced to respond.Stretch\u2019s report was designed for immediate consumption and was therefore short. Other chaplains were able to say far more about the individuals they encountered in Belsen. Indeed, they used their responses to share the testimonies of survivors. Of the sixty-eight pages Swift wrote about Belsen, he used almost twenty to record stories from his many conversations with survivors, such as a Jewish woman who described the process of selection at Auschwitz and the murders of children.[CITATION-118] Swift indicated clearly to the reader that what he knew of Belsen and other evidence was founded on what survivors had told him. For example, he related information regarding German burials of victims in the last few days before the liberation based \u2018[o]n the testimony of a survivor\u2019.[CITATION-119] The value of survivor testimony in conveying the lived realities of Belsen was also recognised by another chaplain, Daniel Cummings. Cummings did not visit Belsen itself, but as a Catholic chaplain to a British military hospital in Bassum, around seventy miles from Belsen, he met many survivors who had been transferred there from the camp. With a knowledge of German, Cummings was able to act as interpreter between patients and the medical staff, in this way encountering and hearing the stories of many survivors.[CITATION-120] For example, the story of a young teenage boy called David affected Cummings in particular. He shared what David told him about his experience: of the German invasion of Poland, the arrival of troops at his village, the rounding up of Jews, the murder of David\u2019s mother and sister, his forced labour in mines, his escape, recapture, evasion of an execution squad, and eventually his liberation by the British. Cummings also noted that the Nazis \u2018gave him a number as his name\u2014it was tattooed on his upper arm. He pulled up his shirtsleeve and showed me the light blue figures marked clearly on his skin. Why had they done this to a Jewish child?\u2019[CITATION-121] In sharing David\u2019s testimony, Cummings confirmed his commitment to replacing a number with a name and a story, restoring identity where it had previously been erased.As I argued earlier, David Stewart moved from an anonymised description of survivors towards sharing individual stories. Twenty-nine of the fifty-eight pages Stewart wrote were dedicated entirely to individual survivors\u2019 testimonies. Most of these accounts were told in the survivors\u2019 own words as they had related them to Stewart in the course of his pastoral care, and they were accompanied by photographs of the respective survivors, not horror images of masses of anonymised victims but named and captioned portraits. For example, alongside a photograph of four young women, arms around each other, he shared the story of \u2018four sisters\u2019: Blanka, Irena, Magda and Anna, all Hungarian Jews. Stewart shared what they told him of their deportation to Auschwitz, the selections, the murders by gas and the operations of the crematoria, but he also included small facts about their lives before the war which could only have been revealed from personal attention to the detail of their conversations: \u2018Their father had a big drapery business in Hungary. Blanka\u2019s husband was an officer in the Hungarian Army\u2019.[CITATION-122] He also related small aspects of his relationship with them in the passing on of their testimony:The last time I saw the four sisters, they were all recovered from typhus and sharing a room in Camp 3. They were happy, for they had just received news that their father and brother were alive. Blanka\u2019s husband was safe, too. They gave me Vienna sausage and sauerkraut, and cold tea, and we ate together.[CITATION-123] The act of listening to survivors\u2019 testimonies and recording them was therefore evidence of an expansive approach to survivor care, in which food and fellowship were shared between chaplain and survivors, as well as stories of the past and hopes for the future. They revealed something of the individual experiences of survivors and some of the truth of the Holocaust, but they also emerged directly from Stewart\u2019s attention to pastoral care. He wrote:That they suffered degradation and indignity is no fault of theirs. It leaves no taint or stigma upon them. The stigma will be ours, who have the power to set them again on their feet, if we fail in our duty to do them this simple service. They have earned their future. Let it be our pleasure and our happiness to ensure that that future holds nothing for them but peace and rest.[CITATION-124] His intention was to ensure that society at large would co-operate with him in guaranteeing a better future for survivors who had suffered so much. Highlighting lived experiences through the recording of testimony was a way to illuminate this duty to a wider audience.In doing so, Stewart was particularly attentive to women\u2019s testimony, sharing details of the sexual violence to which women were often subjected during the Holocaust. For example, an English-speaking woman whom Stewart referred to as \u2018Madame B\u2019 related stories of exploitation at Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp:\u2018No woman was really safe\u2019, she said, \u2018I have been there when an S.S. man has come into the hut and looked around speculatively. I have heard him say, \u201cYou, and you, and you \u2026 come on. Get yourselves washed, the soldiers are waiting.\u201d These girls had to go \u2026 They had to submit to the most beastly usage.\u2019[CITATION-125] It is possible that in a different context such horrific details could have been used in a sensationalist way, to prove the horror and the evil of the Nazi regime. But in the context of Stewart\u2019s pastoral care, and his intention of bearing witness to the truth of what was experienced by the victims of Nazism, he seems to have shared these details in order to give voice to real experiences of women under Nazi persecution. These stories were shared in the words of the survivors themselves, just weeks after they were first spoken to Stewart. The conveying of such testimony by Stewart complicates historians\u2019 existing assumptions that people did not listen to the specifically gendered experiences of women during the Holocaust.[CITATION-126] Just weeks after the liberation, it is clear that a male chaplain did engage with female survivors; he listened to the stories they told of the particular abuses they suffered because they were women as well as Jews; and he deemed these examples important enough to be written up.In Britain, according to David Cesarani, Belsen was not understood through the voiced experiences of survivors themselves, despite the willingness of some survivors to tell their stories.[CITATION-127] Studying Belsen through the accounts of chaplains shows that some of them asked questions and wanted to hear survivors\u2019 stories: chaplains recognised the value of testimonies, both with the express desire that people should know and learn from them, but also so that, in reading and listening to them, the world could safeguard the wellbeing of survivors themselves. Boaz Cohen has concluded that child testimonies collected in 1945 and 1946 in a school in the post-war Displaced Persons camp were \u2018unique \u2026 in their closeness to the events described\u2019.[CITATION-128] Yet chaplains\u2019 accounts were recorded even earlier, gathering testimony from survivors who were just beginning to speak only days and weeks after the liberation.The twenty-nine pages of survivor testimonies in Stewart\u2019s report are not the most detailed testimonies of the Holocaust. They are not recorded interviews, published memoirs or professional oral history accounts. Nevertheless, they are among the very earliest attempts to record the experiences of camp survivors. Stewart\u2019s work precedes by three months the founding of the first Jewish archive of survivor experiences in the British-occupied zone of Germany, and by twelve months the well-known and much-studied documentation work conducted among Displaced Persons by David Boder.[CITATION-129] Both during and immediately after the events of the Holocaust, Jews pursued with urgency a tradition which has been termed \u2018salvage ethnography\u2019, preserving evidence of their plight for the future.[CITATION-130] The uniqueness of Stewart\u2019s account is that he, as a non-Jew, just one month after the liberation of Belsen, recognised an urgent need to record and preserve Jewish survivors\u2019 stories as they were told to him.If most chaplains responded to their experience of Belsen by writing in the immediate aftermath, how they continued to respond later in life\u2014to what must have been the traumatic experience of their time at Belsen\u2014is more difficult to trace. Scholars of the impact of trauma in wartime suggest that it is not the fact of witnessing something particularly painful which is the trigger for trauma. More influential is the nature of the context in which pain is witnessed and later remembered by the individual.[CITATION-131] Chaplains were attached personnel, operating on their own, alongside and within but not as a permanent part of their units. Support\u2014and the opportunity to begin to process what they were encountering\u2014had to be found where it could. In the camp itself it was from each other that chaplains were first able to seek and provide support for themselves. Vincent Fay, for example, wrote home about his \u2018usual clerical visitors\u2019, Morrison and Swift.[CITATION-132] Swift wrote of the way in which chaplains met together as a group \u2018every week\u2019 to divide responsibilities, organising different hospital visit rotas, for example.[CITATION-133] In such circumstances, it is probable that chaplains shared experiences with each other and offered one another mutual support.When chaplains returned to their parishes after the Second World War, however, they were again left on their own to pursue their potentially isolating priestly vocations. T.J. Stretch was interviewed in the camp bynewsman Paul Wyand. In his memoir, Wyand wrote about the deep impact Belsen had on him, describing nightmares and admitting to never having been \u2018quite the same after Belsen\u2019.[CITATION-134] When Wyand\u2019s memoir was serialised in the national press in the late 1950s, Stretch was able to contact him and a very close friendship was renewed between the two men. Stretch\u2019s daughter believes that their friendship must have helped them both to cope with the trauma of what they had experienced.[CITATION-135] Similarly, John Ross maintained contact with several former colleagues from the camp, including one of the Jewish chaplains.[CITATION-136] Although their correspondence can no longer be traced, it can be supposed that these continued relationships, based on very specific shared experiences of witnessing the consequences of genocide, helped chaplains to process this trauma.Re-entering parish ministry after witnessing such acute human experiences at Belsen was not, however, an easy process. In 1952, David Stewart became rector of Kenchester, Bridge Sollars and Bishopstone in the diocese of Hereford, where he enjoyed happier times, such as the village celebration of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. But trauma remained a reality of life. On 9 February 1956 a five-year-old girl was knocked down and killed by a milk lorry in Bishopstone. The children with whom the girl had been playing moments before ran to the rectory, where they roused Stewart from his sick bed. The funeral was held five days later. Four days after that, Stewart himself died at home, aged sixty-six.[CITATION-137] When a reporter from thevisited Stewart in 1953 and asked him about his time at Belsen, Stewart replied, \u2018those things are best forgotten\u2019.[CITATION-138] But the chaplains did not forget Belsen and did speak about it, which is why the reporter knew enough to ask about it. Local parishioners in Herefordshire\u2014as well as in Uggeshall, Suffolk, Stewart\u2019s pre-war parish to which he first returned after the war\u2014knew of Stewart\u2019s Belsen experience. Copies of his Belsen report remain in the possession of local families to whom he gifted them after the war.[CITATION-139] Though it cannot be shown that the experiences he wrote about were disseminated far, it is clear that Stewart would not have written, published and continued to share his report unless he wanted other people, specifically Christians in local British communities, to remember.In some cases, then, chaplains did not feel able to articulate their experiences in direct conversation but still managed to pass on their message to others. Perhaps, in the case of Stewart or Stretch, they felt, as Stretch\u2019s daughter believes of her father, that they had said what they could in their written responses in the immediate aftermath.[CITATION-140] As time went on, it was more difficult to process the experience, but they had at least recorded their response. John Ross might not have spoken to his daughters about Belsen but he preserved his report. If he had not, his experience might have been lost to the historical record. As it was, chaplains\u2019 own words stand as testimony both to what they witnessed at Belsen in 1945 and to their ongoing response in subsequent decades.There is an appropriateness to this ongoing response. Throughout their time at Belsen, chaplains prioritised the welfare and the voices of survivors themselves. It is fitting then that in telling the world of their experience, chaplains spoke less about themselves and their own reaction and allowed their written accounts\u2014which did so much to share the testimony of survivors\u2014to have the final word. As Stewart concluded in his report, he was \u2018glad\u2019 to have experienced Belsen and \u2018glad beyond words I met these people\u2019. He went on to say that he would continue to hold them in his memory into the future: \u2018I hope I shall meet many of them again. My home will always be open to them\u2019.[CITATION-141] When Stretch concluded his report on Belsen, he wondered whether anyone would believe him. His response, he said, \u2018is a simple one. All I have written about I have seen. And what I have seen, I shall never forget. Never\u2019.[CITATION-142] By preserving his experience in a written record, Stretch committed himself to ensuring that others would remember too.In exploring here for the first time the experiences of Stretch and other Christian chaplains, this article has only investigated one side of the encounter between Christian and Jew in the aftermath of Belsen\u2019s liberation. Further work is ongoing to analyse critically the extent to which Jewish voices could be heard, and their experiences understood, through chaplains\u2019 own personal narrative framings. Nevertheless, this study has identified the particular part that chaplains played in the liberation of Belsen, its aftermath and British interactions with the Holocaust. It has also challenged a number of prevailing historical assumptions. Approaching Belsen through the Christian army chaplains is a different way of encountering Holocaust history. The chaplain was not victim, perpetrator or bystander. Nor does the chaplain fit easily into the unhelpful category of \u2018liberator\u2019.Chaplains responded to the Holocaust as Christians in a distinct way. Though much of the British Christian discourse about Belsen minimised or ignored the Jewish identity of most of the camp\u2019s victims, chaplains often recognised Jewish experiences at Belsen and they tried to disseminate an understanding of Jewish identity and Jewish testimony to a larger public. The fact that this article uncovers many of their writings for the first time suggests that their accounts did not have much impact on the wider Christian community, although they certainly tried. This says something about the difference between the response to Belsen of chaplains and the reactions of those Christians who relied on newsreel footage to shape their understanding. Chaplains do not overturn historians\u2019 assumptions that the \u2018liberal imagination\u2019 prevented Britain and the organised churches from understanding Jewish experiences of suffering under the Nazis. Clearly, the wider Christian discourse was different. But chaplains do nuance previous historical understanding: those Christians who witnessed Belsen for themselves identified victims and survivors as Jews and understood something of the distinctiveness of Jewish suffering during the Nazi catastrophe.Finally, they demonstrate that at the very moment of liberation and in the immediate aftermath some people recognised the urgent importance of testimony. Chaplains wanted to listen to survivors\u2019 experiences and they shared such stories both in their attempts at pastoral care and in the clear intention to ensure people learned the truth of what survivors had experienced.The meaning of Colonel Campbell\u2019s 1945 foreword to David Stewart\u2019s account of Belsen is clear: \u2018The true physicians here are the padres, and they are doing more good to the patients than anyone else\u2019.[CITATION-143] Chaplains practised a particular form of care for survivors that exhibited sensitivity to their identities and stories. By restoring knowledge of the distinct role of British Christian chaplains in the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, what Stretch and his fellow chaplains saw\u2014and the lives of the survivors they ministered to and whose testimonies they recorded\u2014can in this way, at last, not only be believed, as Stretch hoped, but be appropriately remembered as well.",
