    "article": "This article examines the work of the jurist and political and social theorist, Joseph Rey. It explores Rey\u2019s role within a French and international network of intellectuals and conspirators who sought to overthrow established monarchies and replace them with popularly elected democratic republics. The article shows how Rey\u2019s extensive writings on legal, political, social and educational questions give a unique insight into France\u2019s political, intellectual, social and ideological life in the first decades of the nineteenth century. We argue that Rey\u2019s contribution to the debates that defined the modern ideological categories of liberalism, republicanism and socialism was significant in its endeavour to reconcile all three. This attempt at reconciliation was motivated by a powerful desire to end the internecine struggles that marked France in the aftermath of the Revolution and Empire. This led Rey to draw on the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and the Philosophical Radicals in order to nourish a French republican liberalism rooted in the work of theand combine this with his profound reading of Robert Owen\u2019s work on co-operation. It goes on to show how Rey became known as France\u2019s principal representative of Owenism, and sought to shape the debates between the dominant schools of French Socialist thought, Fourierism and Saint-Simonianism, by introducing into those discussions a radical conception of equality and the idea of co-operation. Rey\u2019s attempts to reconcile the liberal-republican preoccupation with liberty and self-governance with socialist considerations on equality and social justice stand out from the works of his contemporaries. It is this unique, and long-forgotten, contribution to French and European political and social thought that makes Rey worthy of renewed attention.On 19 August 1820, a series of events convinced the highly respected judge and jurist Joseph Rey that it was time to flee for his life from his home in Paris. Rey had been an important member of a group of distinguished French liberals who were vocal in their objections to the repressive policies of the ministers of Louis XVIII. The group conspired to provoke nationwide armed insurrection against the Bourbon king and his government. Rey was one of the key conspirators, and when the plot was foiled he evaded capture by leaving his native France, eventually making his home in England from the summer of 1821. After his flight, Rey was triedand sentenced to death.[CITATION-1] During Rey\u2019s time in England, between 1821 and 1826, a good deal changed both for him personally and for France. Finding sanctuary in London, he joined a community of prominent European liberal exiles.[CITATION-2] He was welcomed into Jeremy Bentham\u2019s orbit and developed close ties with Robert Owen\u2019s disciples in the city. The impact of Benthamite utilitarianism and Owenite socialism on Rey\u2019s intellectual development and ideological orientation proved decisive. By the time he published his,, in 1836, he had achieved a new and distinctive way of thinking about the constellation of ideas that would, in the 1820s, \u201930s and \u201940s, through contestation and debate, crystallise in the ideologies of liberalism, republicanism and socialism.was ambitious in scope and intent. It offered a deep rethinking of human relations and social organisation. Its objective was revolutionary, and its impact wide-ranging. It was a major intervention in the struggle of ideological formation that marked nineteenth-century French political thought. In that moment, when the great ideological categories of modernity were being forged, Rey sought to bridge a widening gap between the competing and contested variants of liberalism and socialism. He sought to reconcile liberal freedom with republican self-determination, and to accommodate both to a radical and thoroughgoing idea of equality that had been disavowed by French socialists such as Charles Fourier, Henri Saint-Simon and their disciples, but championed by the eighteenth-century revolutionary Gracchus Babeuf and his followers. In the struggle for ideological dominance between competing political beliefs, the challenging ideas ofwere a bridge too far. Failing to fall neatly into any of the ideological parties that forged, and were being forged by, French politics in the first half of the nineteenth century, Rey\u2019s ideas were relegated to the margins of the battles of ideas.Time has been cruel to Joseph Rey. There are remarkably few studies of him or, for that matter, of the intellectual and political life of his native Grenoble, which was rich, vibrant, almost feverish.[CITATION-3] The most famous Grenoblois, Stendhal, clearly had great regard for Rey\u2019s intellect, and saw him as a philosopher of distinction.[CITATION-4] Along with other natives of Grenoble, such as Louis Crozet and Fortun\u00e9 Mantes, Rey was an esteemed figure. But in the twentieth century he was forgotten. Only a tiny number of scholars gave his work any attention. His name appears in a small number of articles devoted to the reception of Owenism in France.[CITATION-5] The remaining handful of articles and books that actually discuss his work are severely dated and limited in scope.[CITATION-6] More recently, Rey has attracted some attention, but for his juridical works.[CITATION-7] Overall, Rey\u2019s writings languish in the shadows of French political thought.Our intention in this article is to correct that deficiency by offering a fresh account of Rey\u2019s work and intellectual trajectory across two distinct phases of his life. Our aim is threefold. First, to make Rey\u2019s life and work more widely understood, and, by doing so, to shed light on the ideological struggles that led to the sharpened outlines of the various concepts, and their relational configuration, that came to make up the grand ideologies of liberalism, socialism and republicanism. Secondly, to show through Rey\u2019s life and work how our understanding of liberalism, republicanism and socialism, and the relation between the three, is impoverished, and how this poverty of understanding is the result of conceptual re-definitions reflecting the ideological struggles of our own day.[CITATION-8] Thirdly, to demonstrate how, through Rey\u2019s work, we can gain a deeper insight into the relationship between liberty and equality, which, after the French Revolution, nineteenth-century French liberalism and socialism alike treated as problematic. This was to leave a lasting legacy in the way our own age confronts questions of equality, and how it attempts to reconcile it to liberty: witness the recent chequered history of the \u2018Third Way\u2019 championed by Anthony Giddens and Tony Blair in the British politics of the 1990s, or Emmanuel Macron\u2019sparty in contemporary France. Through an analysis of Rey\u2019s work, we aim to challenge the widely held conviction (which dominates the historiography on nineteenth-century French political thought) that liberalism and republicanism were in tension, and that the two\u2014French liberalism in particular\u2014stood in conflict with socialism.[CITATION-9] A close analysis of Rey\u2019s work reveals just how complex the relationship between these ideologies was, with each vying for primacy and struggling to find the intellectual resources to solve the burning issues of the day. Rey\u2019s life and work represent a prism through which we can view almost the entire spectrum of political, economic, social, philosophical, juridical, cultural and educational questions that perplexed France in the first half of the nineteenth century. This is testament not only to the fruitfulness of Rey\u2019s thought and to a fertile mind driven by curiosity and a powerful urge to find answers to the fundamental problems of the epoch: it reflects also the myriad issues and their many layers of intricacy that confronted Rey and his contemporaries in their efforts to make sense of a complex and contested world, and through that understanding to establish what they took to be a just and inclusive social order.In addition to these wider objectives, we believe Rey\u2019s life and work merit study for other important reasons. First, born in 1779, Rey represents an intermediary, or intellectual bridge, within the cohort of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European \u2018social reformers\u2019. His year of birth falls between the generation of early socialists, the founders of romantic socialism, Henri Saint-Simon (1760), Robert Owen (1771) and Charles Fourier (1772), and their first disciples: Saint-Amand Bazard (1791), Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my-Prosper Enfantin (1796), Pierre Leroux (1797), Philippe Buchez (1796) and, later, Victor Considerant (1808), Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809), and Louis Blanc (1811). His placement between these generations explains a number of the important characteristics of Rey and his writings.The first of these characteristics was Rey\u2019s desire to act as a kind of intercessor between the principal philosophical and political currents of his day. His motivation for doing this was both intellectual and political. He sought to stimulate and sustain a conversation between republicans and liberals on one hand and Saint-Simonian, Owenite and Fourierist socialists on the other. While this role of intellectual and ideological intermediary was bound up with a deep-seated spirit of inquiry and intellectual openness, it was also motivated by an important social and political concern. This was to prevent, in the aftermath of the Revolution, the further division and eventual atomisation of French society. Rey perceived the principal danger to be the growing intellectual, political and social menace of a narrow economic liberalism, and the profound inequalities arising from it. This liberalism, expressed in the works of Jean-Baptiste Say (1767\u20131832), Charles Comte (1782\u20131837), and Charles Dunoyer (1786\u20131862), narrowed the scope of political economy by separating considerations of wealth creation from wider political and social questions, which their moralising discourse and tone tended to sideline.The second significant characteristic is that Rey\u2019s works serve as a lens through which to analyse the ideological cross-fertilisation that took place between liberalism, republicanism and socialism in the years following the French Revolution and up to the revolutions of 1830 and 1848. Rey\u2019s work is relevant here because, as we will see, his writings on law, politics, economics and education cut across three distinct intellectual orientations: Antoine Destutt de Tracy\u2019s, Jeremy Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism, and Robert Owen\u2019s socialism.Finally, Rey merits study because he represents an exceptional figure in establishing a bridge between intellectual developments in France and Britain. Along with Montesquieu, Tocqueville, Hal\u00e9vy and Aron, he can be seen as a member of an \u2018English\u2019 school in French political thought. In his, Raymond Aron stressed how this \u2018English\u2019 school was wedded to political liberty, the importance of civil society and intermediary bodies and the autonomy of the political sphere, and how it defended the need for political realism and moderation against the allure of utopianism.[CITATION-10] But this was a selective and\u2014given the politically charged era in which Aron was writing\u2014an ideologically motivated reading of British political thought, one that sought to reshape French political thinking in the image of the conservative liberalism of what Quentin Skinner has called \u2018the juridical state\u2019.[CITATION-11] Through Rey, and his attachment to Owenite socialism\u2014including his attempts to reconcile Saint-Simonianism and then Fourierism to it\u2014we can observe a different and more radical English filament in French political thought, one that has been written out of the historiography.[CITATION-12] This strand reflected on both equalityreform, seeing the goal of equality not as a utopian objective but as the achievable objective of reform. Given the turbulent context in which Rey was writing, this aspect of English political thinking became, as he openly avowed, his compass on questions of equality in which the English had benefited from the first and most instructive lessons. This proved a difficult admission for a patriot in a country of revolutions, and a difficult standpoint to comprehend for contemporaries who believed the French, a people who spawned the Montagnard and Gracchus Babeuf\u2019s Conspiracy of Equals, needed no additional lessons on how to think about equality. Yet by engaging with, and learning from, English political thought, in the form of Benthamite utilitarianism and Owenite socialism, Rey\u2019s achievement was to renew intellectually French republicanism and French socialism. As we will see, this intermeshing of utilitarianism and Owenite socialism lent a coherence to Rey\u2019s thought, correcting important deficiencies in republican-liberalism, with its stress on freedom and self-determination, and in utilitarianism, which in turn gave meaning to republican-liberal freedom and self-determination by stressing happiness as the goal of all human action. But for Rey, the new industrial order and the vast inequalities it generated meant that neither freedom nor self-determination nor happiness could ever be realised by the overwhelming majority. The answer to this dilemma, Rey discovered, lay in Owenism, and in the radical equality it offered through ideas of community of goods and the principle of co-operation\u2014a principle that, through a thoroughgoing interrogation and rooting out of all forms of domination, achieved the liberal-republican goals of freedom and self-determination. That this original political theory ultimately failed to inject lasting new life into either French liberal-republicanism or French socialism was not the result of its being a flawed intellectual undertaking; rather, it was the consequence of Rey\u2019s self-effacing personality, and of a political and intellectual culture that, self-absorbed and insular, tended to draw on its own limited intellectual resources, while remaining myopic to other intellectual traditions.Joseph Rey was born in Grenoble on 24 October 1779. Like so many of his generation he was profoundly affected by his childhood memories of the French Revolution. In 1797, he left Grenoble for Paris, where for two years he pursued an eclectic education studying natural sciences, philosophy and politics. In 1799, he returned to Grenoble to join his family\u2019s distillery business. But in 1802 Rey found himself once again in Paris, this time with direction and resolve. He began to study law and fell under the spell of Antoine Destutt de Tracy, the friend and admirer of Thomas Jefferson, author of, and intellectual and political leader of the. Tracy became Rey\u2019s mentor, patron and protector, his \u2018second father\u2019.[CITATION-13] After Rey narrowly failed to become secretary to the eminent philosopher, historian and politician, the comte Constantin Volney, his cause was taken up by another of Tracy\u2019s friends, the leading jurist and judge, Claude-Antoine R\u00e9gnier.[CITATION-14] It was through Tracy and R\u00e9gnier\u2019s patronage that Rey was first appointed to the judiciary in the conquered territories of the Empire and united departments. He sat as a judge in Plaisance, Mayence and Lunebourg, acquiring a reputation as an assiduous and hardworking member of the judiciary: after Napoleon\u2019s fall in July 1814, the restored Bourbon monarchy made Rey president of the court of Rumilly (Savoie). Upon Napoleon\u2019s return to Paris in May 1815, Rey penned a short pamphlet entitled. This widely read and admired work echoed his friend Benjamin Constant\u2019s more famous(1814). In a blistering attack on the Bourbons\u2019 \u2018despotisme militaire et minist\u00e9riel\u2019, Rey painted a picture of Napoleon as a man of genius, a founder of peoples, someone who, through the \u2018power\u2019 of his \u2018genius\u2019, was able, in Rey\u2019s words, \u2018to bring together in the shortest possible time the most varied phases of the whole of human history\u2019. Rey appealed to Napoleon to embrace principles of reason and justice and adopt a moderate liberal constitution \u2018founded solely on the eternal foundation of the greatest wellbeing of the governed\u2019. The, penned by Constant, was the result. But barely had the ink dried on this extraordinary constitutional document when Napoleon\u2019s \u2018Liberal Empire\u2019 was brought to a definitive end. On Louis XVIII\u2019s return, Rey refused to renounce his liberal opinions, repudiate his, or swear allegiance to the Bourbon king. He was removed from the bench, but allowed to practise law. This ushered in a new period in Rey\u2019s life during which he spent much of his time combining theoretical reflection with legal practice: a mixture of theory and practice that would come to define Rey and his work. In the five years after Napoleon\u2019s fall, Rey devoted his time to the composition of works of political commentary and more theoretical works on law, which, unsurprisingly, were concordant with the principles of. This first period of Rey\u2019s writing career (roughly from 1815 to 1820) saw the publication of works such as(1815), and(1819). These theoretical writings were complemented by a series of political interventions, including(1816),(1818),(1818), and(1820).At the end of the second decade of the nineteenth century, and in reaction to the White Terror, Rey joined the ranks of prominent liberal constitutionalists opposing the Bourbons. The government led by the duc Decazes and the first and second Richelieu administrations pursued authoritarian policies, including the politicisation of the judiciary and removal of genuinely independent judges; political interference in elections; and attempts to crush all liberal opposition with the suspension of press freedom in March 1820. These policies violated the 1814 Constitutional Charter, and caused Rey to relaunch the liberal group \u2018Union\u2019 which he had originally started in 1816.Rey first founded the Union as a secret society, along the lines of the Italian Carbonari.[CITATION-15] The group was, in the words of \u00c9douard Gillon, \u2018timid and discreet\u2019, and soon became integrated into the more public and prominent liberal, whose members included Constant, the marquis de Lafayette and Jacques Laffitte. When Rey relaunched the Union in 1820, he could count on the support of a core group from the, which had been suspended in 1819. Rey and his Union championed the cause of the \u2018general propagation of enlightenment and the just principles of social rights\u2019. In Paris the Union attracted to its ranks established liberals such as Lafayette, the duc d\u2019Argenson, Dupont de l\u2019Eure, the lawyer Odilon Barrot, the journalists and political economists Charles Comte and Charles Dunoyer, the journalist Ren\u00e9-Th\u00e9ophile Chatelain of theand the philosopher Victor Cousin. Rey\u2019s place within the Union was important. His, along with hisand, had brought him both notoriety and esteem among those within the group and those outside it, including Constant. The assassination of the duc de Berry in February 1820 led to widespread repression and an immediate crackdown on liberal opinion in France. Leadingliberals, such as Fran\u00e7ois Guizot and Prosper de Barante, were dismissed from the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat; Guizot\u2019s and Cousin\u2019s lectures, which, in Rey\u2019s words, \u2018held the youth in a constant state of agitation against the march of power\u2019, were suspended. At the beginning of June, popular and student protests at the curtailing of press freedoms and other repressive measures were violently crushed.[CITATION-16] These events prompted members of the Union to join with Bonapartists, republicans, liberals and sympathetic officers in the French army to plot an armed uprising. While Rey was noted for his opposition to violence, by the summer of 1820 the regime\u2019s oppression had become too much to bear. Around the end of June he joined with others to conspire to topple Louis XVIII. The insurrection was planned for 19 August.[CITATION-17] The plot, which involved numerous military regiments and other groups throughout France, was an open secret.[CITATION-18] Worse, although the plot\u2019s leaders all agreed on overthrowing the Bourbons, they could not decide on what kind of regime to put in their place. Some, like Lafayette and Dupont de l\u2019Eure, along with a large contingent of students from the Sorbonne and \u00c9cole polytechnique, wanted a republic. Others, such as Manuel, believed it was too damaging to overturn monarchical institutions and so advocated replacing Louis XVIII with the duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. This lack of agreement on the plot\u2019s aims proved a fatal weakness.[CITATION-19] Rey was lucky to evade arrest. He fled first to Switzerland and then to Germany, where he could count on the support of a network of Italian, Swiss and German sympathisers. He subsequently made his way to the Netherlands and, after nearly a year on the run, finally found refuge in Britain.Rey arrived in London in July 1821. Jeremy Bentham and his acolytes, particularly John Bowring, welcomed him and offered financial support.[CITATION-20] Rey joined the select circle of the Utilitarian Society, where he met \u2018the young John Mill\u2019, and discussed and debated with the Philosophical Radicals topics such as \u2018unlimited freedom of trade\u2019.[CITATION-21] Rey was also a key figure in the international network of progressive thinkers and politicians which included Bowring and Edward Blaquiere. Lafayette was critical to this network, and liberal internationalism more generally. He organised the Madrid-basedand, in 1826, the Paris-based.[CITATION-22] He raised funds for Rey, and encouraged him in assisting General Fran\u00e7ois-Antoine Lallemand\u2019s efforts to establish a legion of French exiles to defend the Spanish government at C\u00e1diz.[CITATION-23] Rey became, in his own words, Lallemand\u2019s \u2018charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s lib\u00e9raux\u2019.[CITATION-24] He helped obtain passports for many of these \u2018liberal refugees\u2019, Britain being the only European country to support the new liberal regimes in Spain and Portugal.[CITATION-25] He also served as an important intermediary between these liberal exiles and the Philosophical Radicals. His close ties to Tracy, Lafayette and Bowring, combined with the fact that Bentham supported the new liberal governments, kept Rey\u2014as he had been since 1816\u2014at the centre of a web of European liberal exiles and conspirators.[CITATION-26] His organisational skills were accompanied by important theoretical reflections. Rey\u2019s preoccupation with law and judicial institutions prompted him to imitate the efforts of his old tutor, the comte Lanjuinais, who ran a \u2018Free School\u2019 of law during the Restoration. Not long after arriving in London, Rey offered his own course of lectures on French law and judicial institutions.[CITATION-27] The course was popular with English and \u00e9migr\u00e9 liberal and radical audiences in London, and would serve as the foundation for his 1828.[CITATION-28] Rey\u2019s lectures, and the answers he supplied to Bentham\u2019s many questions on French law, were important for the latter\u2019s, a work that was only finalised in 1830.[CITATION-29] Bentham opened his library to Rey, who used this access productively. He wrote two parallel works to Bentham\u2019s:(1828) and, as we have already noted, the. Both works represented an important maturation in Rey\u2019s reflections on penal, civil and constitutional law. And both owed a profound debt to Bentham, who enthusiastically welcomed the publication of, describing it as a \u2018parallel view\u2019, and even trying to get his French translator, Etienne Dumont, to translate it into English.[CITATION-30] In, Rey drew extensively on Bentham. At the same time, he departed from Bentham\u2019s principle of utility by giving it a more egalitarian interpretation, arguing that Bentham\u2019s formulation of the \u2018greatest happiness of the greatest number\u2019 was inadequate for securing social harmony and that social peace could not be achieved without attending to the welfare ofmembers of society.[CITATION-31] What caused this departure from Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism?While playing an important role among French \u00e9migr\u00e9 liberals and occupying a place in the community of English Philosophical Radicals, Rey also immersed himself in London\u2019s rich intellectual and political life. He attended meetings of religious sects, participated in the meetings of political clubs and philosophical societies, and frequented \u2018coffee houses intended exclusively for the working class\u2019, where he \u2018heard men of great understanding, and sometimes very good orators\u2019.[CITATION-32] Most importantly, Rey attended meetings of the Co-operative Society, the forum of the Owenites. It was in this milieu that, as his memoirs record, he found answers to some of Europe\u2019s most pressing problems, and his liberalism took on a decidedly more egalitarian turn.[CITATION-33] Rey\u2019s attendance at both the Utilitarian and the Co-operative Societies pitched him into the centre of an animated debate between the Philosophical Radicals and the followers of Owen. Rey\u2019s adherence to the underlying epistemology ofmeant that he defended Bentham\u2019s thought against those who saw it as a eulogy to hedonism. According to Rey, the great value of Benthamite utilitarianism was twofold. First, its great philosophical and social purpose was to disperse the \u2018clouds of mysticism\u2019 that enveloped so much legal and political thought. Second, by specifying the concept of utility, it defined an objective criterion of human, political and social happiness. But on this latter point Rey departed from Bentham\u2019s classic formulation, proposing instead to define utility as the \u2018happiness of the greatest number, and of, if possible, of every individual\u2019.[CITATION-34] Rey\u2019s definition bore the imprint of Owen\u2019s ideas on co-operation and community. He believed this recasting of utility to be an improvement on Bentham\u2019s felicific calculus, which tried, but failed, to reconcile individual self-interest with a common good. Rey\u2019s more egalitarian understanding of utility reconciled, he believed, knowledge of individual conduct with the aim of political and social activity, thereby achieving the legislator\u2019s elusive goal of social harmony.[CITATION-35] The attempt to reconcilewith utilitarianism, and both with a more thoroughgoing equality, was reflected in Rey\u2019s impressive. This work claimed a rigorous impartiality that stemmed from an extensive observation of the \u2018economic and moral state\u2019 of the English people, while concluding with a balance sheet inspired by Bentham\u2019s.[CITATION-36] It was a text that, in drawing on Bentham\u2019sand, attacked William Blackstone\u2019sand its underlying aristocratic bias. But Rey went beyond Bentham, contending that the harmony of a nation expressed in its institutions could not be achieved by unfettered social interactions. There was no \u2018invisible hand\u2019 that reconciled competing interests, no system that led to a providential balance of advantage. Instead, from inequality sprang an incessant struggle, which was only ever temporarily interrupted by the imposition of a Hobbesian politics of force and fear, involving the dominion of the powerful few over the many. At bottom, the \u2018laws of England\u2019 legitimised avarice and conquest as the principles of \u2018social organisation\u2019. Rey believed Bentham had set out the objective bases\u2014and measure\u2014of social activity. Just legal institutions reflected this. But Rey pushed the argument further. He contended that what Bentham really showed was that if legal institutions were to be true to the principle of utility, they had to be defined collectively, and from below. To illustrate this point Rey offered an alternative history of England in his chapter on the \u2018mass of the people\u2019. There, he listed the numerous political and legal accretions brought about by England\u2019s elites, and discussed how these carried with them the means by which \u2018the people\u2019 could resist despotism. These gains consisted of the election of members of the House of Commons, of transparency and publicity, the use of committees, the rights and privileges of certain towns and religious sects, and education.It is clear that Rey shared with Bentham a profound desire to, as he put it, \u2018p\u00e9n\u00e9trer d\u2019une mani\u00e8re plus fructueuse dans l\u2019examen des institutions sociales\u2019.[CITATION-37] His adherence to the\u2019 epistemology, methodology, historiography and programme of political and social reform all mirrored Bentham\u2019s liberal utilitarianism and the more radical forms of egalitarian polities that it could lead to. Rey\u2019s similarity of approach and political intent with Philosophical Radicalism stimulated Bentham to write glowingly of Rey\u2019s work to defenders of the liberal cause, and to introduce Rey\u2019s work to an English and American readership.[CITATION-38] Rey\u2019s focus on law and judicial institutions was complemented by a preoccupation that fuelled discussions in meetings of the Co-operative Society: that law was all too easily usurped as an instrument of domination. This constant threat of domination by, in Bentham\u2019s phrase, \u2018sinister interest\u2019, took on many forms historically. The advent of commercial society liberated many from the yoke of the, or, in the rhetoric of late eighteenth-century liberals, freed producers,, from the parasitic machinations of an idle aristocracy,. But the triumph of a new commercial and industrial order created its own form of domination, reduced to a single and threatening form. Drawing on his own experience as a minor distiller driven out of business by a powerful commercial rival, and anticipating what would become, by the mid-1830s, a widespread fear within liberal, socialist and conservative circles of a rising hegemonic industrial aristocracy, Rey showed how a new \u2018extreme inequality\u2019 was emerging in European societies.[CITATION-39] The \u2018colossal fortunes\u2019 of a new and exclusive class of individuals contrasted sharply with the common people\u2019s poverty. According to Rey, systemic and widespread greed, masked by a Burkean or Blackstonian rhetoric of \u2018naturalness\u2019 and of \u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018organic\u2019 evolution, instilled in subjects and lawmakers alike a \u2018mechanical veneration for antiquity\u2019 and left unquestioned increasingly harsh forms of domination in \u2018a country ruled by industry\u2019.[CITATION-40] This allowed for, and justified, an economic system that, in Rey\u2019s words, contrived to see wealth \u2018accumulate in a small number of hands\u2019.[CITATION-41] Rey\u2019s adherence to, and in particular to Tracy\u2019s programme of(its fourth volume being devoted to political economy), inspired him to undertake a thorough investigation of industrial Britain. The study, which enumerated Britain\u2019s industrial successes and ills, was a defining experience for Rey. It led him, as he would later explain, to move away from reflecting on ameliorating existing legal institutions, which ultimately served \u2018the maintenance of a more or less vicious social system\u2019, toward \u2018the examination of the fundamental conditions of any organised society\u2019, the principles of social harmony.[CITATION-42] In his unpublished memoirs, Rey described two fundamental causes for this change of intellectual preoccupation, though he never saw it as a departure from. The first involved a visit in 1822 or 1823 to an enlightened asylum and its infant school in Spitalfields. Rey\u2019s knowledge of French infant schools, and a thorough understanding of the\u2019 and\u2019 reflections on education, informed what he saw. This was an example of the unlimited possibilities of learning, properly conceived, a trope of both theandthat Rey knew well. The visit confirmed his belief that education, was, in his words, \u2018one of the principal paths of the peaceful transformation of society\u2019.[CITATION-43] The second factor in his new intellectual orientation, which occurred around the same time, was his taking cognisance of Owenism. Rey described in his memoirs having read Owen\u2019s work carefully, notably, and participating regularly in meetings of the London Co-operative Society. Though Rey never broke with, his participation in the Co-operative Society led to an assimilation of Owenism\u2019s fundamental principles summarised in two words: \u2018community\u2019 and \u2018equality\u2019. Rey recalled that he \u2018finally saw the sweet harmony spread over all the members of the magnificent family, united forever by the bonds of love, of the general fraternity\u2019.[CITATION-44] If Rey was awestruck by his reading of Owen, it was not long before he was also reading the works of Charles Fourier and the first issues of the Saint-Simonian journal,. Shortly afterwards, Olinde Rodrigues invited Rey to contribute his reflections on Owenism in the pages of that journal. Two short articles were published, in the September and October issues of 1826. They were later combined with a third article in a small volume under the title(1828), the first comprehensive discussion of Owen\u2019s work in French.Rey\u2019s initial article identified the fatal characteristics of the nineteenth-century economy. The first was what he called \u2018the spirit of exclusive INDIVIDUALITY\u2019.[CITATION-45] This spirit placed the \u2018principle of competition\u2019 at the heart of all social interactions and justified the prime consequence of both private property and wealth: \u2018extreme inequality in the distribution of goods \u2026 [and] the accumulation of wealth by a small number of individuals\u2019.[CITATION-46] This buttressed a world of scarcity, with an inefficient use of resources, and produced mutual distrust in society. This paradoxical and anomalous condition was, as Rey saw it, the \u2018systematic organisation of disorder\u2019.[CITATION-47] The Owenite alternative was a \u2018true social order, that is to say, the only one that can give man in society the greatest possible sum of happiness\u2019.[CITATION-48] How could such alchemy work? Rey listed some fifteen features of Owen\u2019s system, which could be grouped under two broad headings: the economic and social, and the political and moral. Economically and socially, a community relied on the common ownership of land and \u2018instruments and capital\u2019. This was driven by the imperative of the equal enjoyment of goods, or in Rey\u2019s words, positing a direct relationship between community and equality, of a community in which there was \u2018l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de jouissance dans les produits\u2019.[CITATION-49] At the political and moral level, Rey stressed that Owen\u2019s system was co-operative and therefore a significant departure from the community of fear that marked life under Europe\u2019s established orders. The Owenite community was governed by an \u2018unlimited freedom\u2019, the prerequisite for \u2018the establishment of any co-operative community\u2019.[CITATION-50] Rey envisaged the widest definition possible of freedom. This included an expansive understanding of individual liberties, encompassing freedom of thought, expression and association, and also political liberties, including freedom of participation, deliberation and self-governance. Bound up with these two complementary conceptions of freedom were ideas of learning and education, which were directed toward, and informed by, individual and social co-operation, particularly the idea that education was a collaborative process of discovery defined by a non-hierarchical relationship between student and teacher. Rey\u2019s thoughts on equality in learning drew on an understanding of the Socratic method. This idea of learning as a collaborative activity informed all of Rey\u2019s writings and projects on education, from(1828) to(1841), and the practical projects he undertook in Grenoble after 1844, including the establishment of a cr\u00e8che and(refuge).Rey believed that Owen\u2019s system enunciated an understanding of community shaped by equality. The community of equals whose members lived co-operatively was not only the guarantee of \u2018social harmony\u2019, it was also the key to eradicating the \u2018deadly principle of competition\u2019. He summarised these twin ends thus: \u2018It seems to me beyond doubt that a system of mutual co-operation conjoined to community and the equal enjoyment of goods, would destroy the germ of the divisions born of the state of individual competition, that is to say the clashing of efforts in production and the laying of claims to enjoyment\u2019.[CITATION-51] Rey\u2019s second article provided a history of similar systems of co-operation, and it listed and analysed ongoing British and American experiments in co-operative living, concluding that the idea of the co-operative community was in the process of realisation. The third article responded to the principal objections to the idea of co-operative community. Rey contended that it was possible to achieve such a community to the extent that its members were properly educated and lived according the principles of sympathy and altruism. These principles would serve as the foundation for a form of social organisation representing a significant improvement on the deplorable situation of the day, while being brought about without violence or any counter-productive upheaval in the existing social order.Rey returned to France in the middle of 1826 after being pardoned by Charles X\u2019s government. For two years he lived in Saone-et-Loire under police surveillance, and in 1828 he finally returned to Paris. In the aftermath of the 1830 revolution, Rey harboured hopes that his former liberal co-conspirators, now in positions of power, would help find him a post either in the teaching of law or in the Parisian judiciary. Rey\u2019s impressiveplaced him in an ideal position to be considered for both. Yet his shift toward socialism had alienated many of his former liberal confederates. It was only thanks to Lafayette\u2019s help that Rey was able to obtain a position as adviser to the law court at Angers. He moved there in October 1830 and remained for nine years. He did not flourish in the post, and often described himself to friends as a \u2018poor exile in the provinces\u2019.[CITATION-52] On his return to France in 1826, Rey quickly took on the role of France\u2019s leading apostle of Owenism. His efforts at promoting Owen\u2019s ideas were not limited to his transmission of them in his. About the time thewere published, he undertook to create a co-operative society in Paris on the model of the London organisation. He was joined in this by Owen\u2019s other leading French disciples, Marc-Antoine Jullien, Charles de Lasteyrie, Adolphe Radiguel and Louis Evrat. While the first article of the society\u2019s statutes referred to the three pillars of the Owenite system, the second article affirmed that the society was not just about the \u2018propagation of the principles\u2019 of Owenism, but also about encouraging \u2018the creation of practical communities based on this system\u2019. Though the society failed to realise its goals, Rey was indefatigable in continuing to promote Owen\u2019s ideas to a wide audience, notably through the work of the Society of Christian Morality (), whose members included leading liberals such as Guizot. One of the Society\u2019s central preoccupations was education. It was on this question that Rey proved to be a leading innovator, combining the lessons ofand Owenism. Rey published two important texts at this time on education:(1829), a critical analysis of Joseph Jacotot\u2019s innovative educational system, and, in the aftermath of the July Revolution,. In this latter text, Rey advocated a revolutionary and comprehensive educational system aimed at all classes, sexes and ages. It involved the education of children from an early age, favoured an encyclopaedic approach, inspired by Jullien\u2019s, and stressed instruction in practical arts. It treated all forms of knowledge equally, intellectual and practical, and emphasised the essential complementarity of moral, intellectual and physical improvements. It also highlighted the need to avoid the hierarchical classification of the faculties and competition in learning. Against traditional pedagogical approaches, Rey stressed the complementarity of family life and formal schooling, effacing the boundary between learning and affection and tenderness. He rejected religious instruction because it maintained established social hierarchies and divisions. Finally, he advocated extending education beyond the primary, secondary and post-secondary levels. He contended that education should be an integral dimension to an individual\u2019s life; that it should, through institutions such as free schools, theatres, exhibitions, concerts and the plastic and fine arts, continue for the duration of an individual\u2019s lifespan.Rey frequently cited the 1791as informing some of his ideas. The leading liberal Marc-Ren\u00e9 Voyer d\u2019Argenson, who lived through the 1789 Revolution, was clearly impressed by Rey\u2019s ideas. In writing to Rey, Voyer d\u2019Argenson praised the idea that \u2018the social body must govern education\u2019,[CITATION-53] and that this emphasis would diminish the deleterious effects of an ideological impulse and rallying banner of the July Monarchy, the idea of \u200b\u200b\u2018capacity\u2019 or ability. This idea emerged in response to the perceived chaos of the French Revolution, with its transfer of sovereign power from the monarch to the people. For those who advanced the idea of \u2018capacity\u2019, including Guizot and the Saint-Simonians, popular sovereignty represented a threat to political stability and therefore needed to be replaced by a new \u00e9lite politics, anchored in the idea of \u2018capacity\u2019 or ability, which would achieve order and stability. But the idea of \u2018capacity\u2019 also arose as a response to profound social changes. It signalled a shift away from the hierarchical order of thetoward meritocracy. Capacity, or ability, so liberals and socialists believed, cut across old class and cultural cleavages. But it also rested on the separation and hierarchical ranking of individuals\u2019 intellectual and physical qualities, favouring the former over the latter.[CITATION-54] This led to new inequalities.[CITATION-55] But these, liberals and socialists believed, were justified, a position summed up in the pithy Saint-Simonian slogan, \u2018From each according to his abilities to each according to his works\u2019. In his letter to Rey, d\u2019Argenson stressed that the new class of notables, whose representatives would dismiss Rey\u2019s, \u2018completely ignore that the intelligent use of the muscular strength requires the development of judgment, of increased common sense and often of strength of character\u2019.[CITATION-56] This dimension to Rey\u2019s reflections on education occupied a central place in his 1829 pamphlet on Joseph Jacotot\u2019s method,. Rey described Jacotot as a revolutionary \u2018inventor\u2019 whose principles \u2018consist[ed] above all in making pupils\u2019act in the acquisition of knowledge instead of enslaving it to the preconceived ideas of a master\u2019.[CITATION-57] Rey was also struck by the privileged status Jacotot assigned to analysis, the use of analogies, the orderly and systematic progression of the acquisition of knowledge, the balance between memory and judgement, and the advice Jacotot offered when it came to practical exercises of repetition to develop a pupil\u2019s attention span. But Rey objected to Jacotot\u2019s account of the \u2018equality of intellect\u2019 or \u2018aptitude\u2019 (), which, while praiseworthy because it promoted the \u2018intellectual emancipation\u2019 of the individual by \u2018giving each person a strong sense of his strength and dignity\u2019, was also detrimental for two important reasons.[CITATION-58] First, and paradoxically, the \u2018equality of intellect\u2019 or \u2018aptitude\u2019 could lead to an even greater stigmatisation of inequalities. Such stigmatisation Rey saw arising not because of differences of intellect or aptitude, but of willpower or determination: \u2018the idea of \u200b\u200ban inferior inclination toward intellect is as discouraging as that of an inferior inclination toward a strong will\u2019.[CITATION-59] Moreover, according to Rey, this thesis of \u2018the equality of intellect\u2019 was indicative of a residual fetishism around the conception of intellect itself, with some facets being considered superior to others. Rey drew on the\u2019 and Owen\u2019s ideas, particularly their views on the relation between environment, learning and adaptation, to defend the idea of \u200b\u200bthe variety and diversity of forms of intellect, as well as the impossibility of ranking them: \u2018according to the laws of our [physical, mental, and social] organisation, there is an infinite variety in the various elements of our intellectual and moral faculties, as well as in our physical faculties\u2019. Despite these serious disagreements with Jacotot, Rey, along with the progressive educational theorists of his day, from Pestalozzi to Owen, subscribed to the universality of the principles, as well as the constant improvement of the application, of an enlightened, adapted and adaptable, comprehensive and tolerant education. Rey would apply these principles and practices in experimenting with the creation of an infant school in Angers, which employed his new teaching methods.Rey\u2019s reflections on Owen\u2019s ideas and their potential application in France, from the community of goods to the equal treatment of the faculties and equal education, met a mixed reception. Hiswere openly condemned in the liberal press. In, the organ of young, liberal France until it was taken over by the Saint-Simonians in October 1830, Tanneguy Duch\u00e2tel attacked them as presenting a \u2018pure chimerical\u2019 vision of society, one that was fundamentally at odds with the institutions that upheld a sound, decent and respectable social order: the family, private property and religion.[CITATION-60] While the liberal press was hostile, minority socialist and radical opinion in France, which continued to be nourished by the writings of Robespierre and Babeuf, was receptive. In the, Marc-Antoine Jullien praised Owen\u2019s work, and published Charles Renouard\u2019s flattering review of Rey\u2019s 1828, along with an equally adulatory review of Rey\u2019s 1830.[CITATION-61] Rey\u2019s defence of radical equality and the abolition of private property was anathema to liberals. But to egalitarian socialists, such as Jullien, it presented one of the definitive formulations of equality, co-operation and fraternity.Philippe Buonarroti, author of, shared Rey\u2019s defence of equality. Buonarroti and Rey were introduced probably through their mutual friend and co-conspirator, Joachim de Prati, whom Rey met in Switzerland at the end of 1820.[CITATION-62] Buonarroti admired Rey as a fellow defender of the cause of equality and liberty. And, influenced by Rey\u2019s adoption of Owenite principles and arguments favouring radical equality, Buonarroti became convinced of the similarities between Owen\u2019s ideas on community and his own.[CITATION-63] In the first edition of his(1828), Buonarroti devoted a long note to Owen, obviously inspired by his reading of Rey\u2019s. In that note, Buonarroti drew parallels between Owen and the \u2018democrats of the Year IV\u2019, saying \u2018What they were unable to implement in France, a generous man has recently tried to achieve by other means in the British Isles and America\u2019. He praised Owen\u2019s critique of private property, and highlighted just how similar Owen\u2019s understanding of co-operative communities was to Babeuf\u2019s view of society. He commended Owen\u2019s \u2018communities based on the principle of equal distribution of pleasures and pains\u2019, in which individuals would be in \u2018perfect equality\u2019.[CITATION-64] In Buonarroti\u2019s estimation, Robert Owen and Gracchus Babeuf were the great visionaries of equality.A similar encounter with Owen\u2019s ideas took place among Buonarroti\u2019s allies and former conspirators in the \u2018Great Firmament\u2019 of French and Italian republican conspiracies: Saint-Amand Bazard, Philippe Buchez, Pierre Leroux and Prati, now Saint-Simonians.[CITATION-65] They were intrigued by Owen and sought to make his ideas more widely known. At the heart of this Saint-Simonian universe was a fevered intellectual activity, and Rey was drafted in to introduce Owen\u2019s ideas to the French. Rey\u2019saroused intense interest among the Saint-Simonians. From the publication of that work until the 1832 arrest and trial of the leading Saint-Simonians Prosper Enfantin, Michel Chevalier and Charles Duveryier, Rey played an important role among the Saint-Simonians. But, unlike the majority of those who participated in the movement, his position was, in the words of Pierre Avril, \u2018that of the questioner, the potential dissident, the latent heretic\u2019.[CITATION-66] Rey was present at the first session of the meetings ofon 17 December 1828, by which time he had already distinguished himself by his critical questioning of Saint-Amand Bazard and his ideas.[CITATION-67] Once Rey arrived in Angers, he became the correspondent of the Saint-Simonian group for Maine-et-Loire and Mayenne, recruiting disciples to the movement, and disseminating its doctrine in local newspapers. In his letters to Michel Chevalier, Charles Duguet and Charles Lemonnier, he distinguished himself by being a person of, in the words of Duguet, \u2018generous independence\u2019.[CITATION-68] Rey would always recognise that, despite representing Owen\u2019s doctrine of community, he and the Saint-Simonians were working towards a common future that involved the end of man\u2019s exploitation of man. He recognised that in this undertaking the Saint-Simonians had made decisive advances, \u2018an intellectual and moral appearance that will occupy more space than one believes in the serious history of progress\u2019.[CITATION-69] Yet, despite this praise, Rey constantly raised serious concerns about Saint-Simonianism, particularly the Saint-Simonians\u2019 objections to Owenism. He summarised these concerns in a letter to Michel Chevalier of 17 December 1831. While arguing for the rapprochement of Owenism and Saint-Simonianism on the basis of their common \u2018social leanings\u2019 (\u2018tendances sociales\u2019), he highlighted several caveats. The first was directed at the Saint-Simonians\u2019 progressive conception of history. Rey explained that he could not accept a conception of history that was blindly wedded to ideas of constant progress and a boundless human perfectibility. He signalled to Chevalier that he especially objected to the Saint-Simonians\u2019 reverence for the supposed organicism of the Middle Ages and their relative undervaluing of the eighteenth century. Here, the Saint-Simonians were unwittingly allying themselves to aristocratic liberalism\u2019s reverence for a natural aristocracy that, as Prosper de Barante argued in his widely read(1821), served to check the supposed baleful consequences of the modern democratic society, such as social atomisation, popular sovereignty and political immoderation.[CITATION-70] Rey believed, too, that the epistemological foundations of Saint-Simonianism leaned dangerously close to a philosophic spiritualism, which had been transmitted in articles, books and lectures by Joseph Marie de G\u00e9rando, Pierre Royer-Collard, Th\u00e9odore Jouffroy and Jean-Philibert Damiron. This spiritualism, in Rey\u2019s opinion antithetical to the aims of Saint-Simonianism, sought to denigrate the Enlightenment and direct the French on an altogether different path from that set for them by theand their natural heirs, the.[CITATION-71] Rey saw more clearly than the Saint-Simonians themselves the intellectual, social and political trajectory of this new spiritualism. Its origins lay in legitimism and the conservative liberalism of the. For this reason, it was fundamentally opposed to the Saint-Simonians\u2019 social and political objectives and to the logical and epistemological foundations of the movement in empiricism. Rey also argued that the new spiritualism underpinningwas more tightly bound to Catholicism\u2014a \u2018distortion\u2019 of primitive Christianity\u2014than the Saint-Simonians cared to recognise. He asserted that if a religion was to be maintained and to evolve so that it corresponded to a new era of industry, it could only do so not by some dubious overvaluation of spiritualism but by a proper regard for materialism and material circumstances. In a similar vein, as Rey explained to Chevalier, the idea of the presence and imprint of the divine could be nothing more than a na\u00efve hypothesis in the era of positive knowledge; knowledge that must more clearly adopt the \u2018analytic\u2019 method rather than yield to the vague approximations of \u2018synthesis\u2019. According to Rey, the economic implications of this were significant. Even if Saint-Simonianism and Owenism shared a critical stance toward the established social, economic and political order, and aspired to reshape it positively, they would diverge fundamentally on two critical and related issues because of Saint-Simonianism\u2019s careless rejection of materialism. First, by conceiving of redistribution in terms that were strictly proportionate to contribution, the Saint-Simonians would reintroduce social inequality and therefore the \u2018venom\u2019 of \u2018hostile competition\u2019 within the new industrial organised world. Secondly, the Saint-Simonian idea of \u200b\u200bassociation remained firmly hierarchical.[CITATION-72] Against the Saint-Simonian system of ranking from above, Rey noted \u2018that the system of the election from below could be perfected in such a way as to avoid the disadvantages it has presented up to the present day\u2019.[CITATION-73] In a concluding observation, he highlighted the important role of women in the future life of the community, a role the Saint-Simonians could not agree on. The movement was significantly weakened by the dramatic schism between its two leaders: Saint Amand Bazard, who was not interested in the question, and Prosper Enfantin, who called for women\u2019s sexual liberation.[CITATION-74] Unless we close our eyes to the light, it is impossible for any man who has really read the fundamental writings of the [Saint-Simonian] School, not to be at least struck with admiration for the greatness of the problems that its disciples proposed to solve in the three fields of industry, fine arts and science, united in a common assemblage by the incalculable bond of a universal religion, based solely on the love of all members of humanity.[CITATION-75] This was the verdict Rey passed on Saint-Simonianism around 1830. But this generous assessment carried with it a powerful punch, which would hit hard those other socialist doctrines which had a similar rootedness in \u2018capacity\u2019, such as Fourierism. Rey pointed to a weakness inherent to Saint-Simonianism from its inception: that it carried the vestiges of religion which authorised, through the idea of ability, \u200b\u200bthe reintroduction of essential differences and inequalities between individuals; inequalities reflecting a divine division between the elect and the not elect; inequalities that the new industrial association would consecrate. Against this, Rey would pit a vision of economy, society and polity that emerged out of a thoroughgoing intellectual engagement with Tracy, Bentham and Owen.was a comprehensive synthesis of Rey\u2019s research and ideas up to the mid-1830s, the culmination of many years of systematic reflection, and an impressive attempt to bring together the empiricist liberal-republicanism ofand the various strands of Fourierist and Saint-Simonian socialism under the banner of the radical equality of Owenism. Published in two large volumes, and dedicated to Rey\u2019s mentor and old friend Destutt de Tracy, who had died in March 1836, the book begins with a movingto the famous. Tracy was, in Rey\u2019s words, a \u2018profound philosopher\u2019 and \u2018excellent man\u2019. His work, dedicated to the cause of \u2018social progress\u2019, was an \u2018immortal monument raised to the true science\u2019 and \u2018triumph of truth\u2019.From the outset,directs the reader toward considerations of methodology, the hallmark ofas the starting-point for tackling the fundamental problem of social order. Rey began the preface with an arresting statement: \u2018the present era is marked by one of those crises of humanity where social reality appears on the verge of collapse, where everything is called into question\u2019.[CITATION-76] The solution to this perilous situation was to secure the foundations of the social order on a veritable \u2018science of social organisation\u2019, which involved drawing on a positive method and not mere supposition.[CITATION-77] This, according to Rey, required starting from observation and directing knowledge towards a pragmatic goal \u2018which touches on our true needs\u2019.[CITATION-78] The stress on need was followed by Rey\u2019s account of a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 science of social organisation, drawing from Tracy\u2019sand Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism. This science rested on \u2018calm reason\u2019 and the \u2018experimental method\u2019 in which normative claims flowed directly from empirical observation. It was informed by the other natural sciences and the \u2018observations of phenomena\u2019. From these observations, man could draw \u2018the conclusions \u2026 for the satisfaction of his interests\u2019.[CITATION-79] The science of social organisation was a pragmatic one whose purpose was to direct human action. Much like Bentham\u2019s \u2018science of legislation\u2019, it would instruct the legislator in \u2018rationally directing human actions\u2019.[CITATION-80] In a move that followed the logic of Bentham\u2019s felicific calculus and Tracy\u2019s science of ideology, Rey judged that this science of action was by definition political economy, a science whose \u2018general object is to consider men\u2019sin society in relation to\u2019.[CITATION-81] And, like Tracy and Bentham, Rey saw that this \u2018theory\u2019 (itself \u2018the consequence of human actions\u2019) had to examine what determined the conditions of actions, sentiments and ideas. These three interrelated dimensions were themselves rooted in the \u2018knowledge of the laws of human organisation\u2019, in physiology: \u2018as PHYSIOLOGY is the science of observation of all, it is obvious that it must include intellectual, moral and economic phenomena, as all other outcomes of our constitution ()\u2019.[CITATION-82] Rey contended that the originality of this \u2018science of the social man\u2019 must be expressed not only by a structure but also in a particular language. To this end, he sketched out the following synthetic table:Or the science of man in all its generality and of which an important branch is that which is the object of this volume:Or the science of the functions of the LIFE of, which general division includes in turn the following three subdivisions:IdeologyOr the science of our ideas,PhrenologyOr the science of our feelings,PraxeologyOr the science of our actions.[CITATION-83] After providing this sketch, Rey asked rhetorically, in a direct challenge to Saint-Simonianism andliberalism, whether there was an essential element missing from this table, namely religion, a form of unifying knowledge that served as the \u2018means of linking [individuals] to a common goal\u2019? Such a hypothetical element, which, given the current state of knowledge, could not confirm the existence of God or the reality of life after death, was, according to Rey, detrimental to the investigation of human happiness. In an era dominated by Catholicism, religious dogma, \u2018far from contributing to social harmony, far from uniting men, as the etymology of the word religion indicates, has only sown ferment and discord\u2019.[CITATION-84] The first volume ofwas at heart an updating of the\u2019 original project in the light of recent advances in physiology. Rey\u2019s materialism was here explicit. He made clear in the concluding chapter that \u2018no aspect of the science of man\u2019.[CITATION-85] The \u2018functions of our system\u2019 (\u2018\u2019), of the human and social bodies in their various constituent elements, should be classified and categorised. But, as Rey reminded his readers, these classifications and categorisations, which \u2018resulted from\u2019, could not be treated in isolation from each other; they had to be considered in the totality of their interconnectedness, and in relation to their natural and social environments, including social interactions: \u2018The human organism is ONE, all of its elements are connected and interlaced at all points; each of its parts affects all the others and is affected in turn by each\u2019.[CITATION-86] Rey\u2019s stress on the physicality of the human organism and its connection to the social body and body politic\u2014what was subsumed under Anthropobiology and Anthropology\u2014scotched any idea of \u200b\u200bthe independence, orpre-eminence of the mind, of the \u2018intellectual faculties\u2019 as a distinct or independent entity from matter.[CITATION-87] Instead, Rey drew on the neurophysiological ideas ofsuch as Cabanis, and stressed the centrality of the nervous system to intellectual processes. It was the source of intellect, emotions and actions, and it was in a reciprocal relation with the natural and human environments, and all social interactions.[CITATION-88] Anthropobiology worked at two levels: that of individuals, and that of groups, and went so far as to encompass the species as a whole. Rey\u2019s definition of anthropobiology was rooted in the basic epistemology of, but it also bore the imprint of Owenite ideas, particularly the role assigned to environmental factors\u2014what Rey called \u2018the empire of the circumstances\u2019\u2014in shaping human behaviour. Anthropobiology took account of the variety of these factors, including geography, environment, race, gender, age and class. Despite the wide variation of circumstances affecting human behaviours, Rey stressed that humans shared a common trait, which, once social circumstances were altered correctly, could be fully and universally realised. This was perfectibility, a perfectibility that directs human action in the properly educated and bounded individual toward a form of self-interest that saw the person recognise his interconnectedness with, and dependence on, others. Instead of the limited liberal vision of \u2018self-interest rightly understood\u2019, Rey presented a conception of self-interest that had mutuality as its defining characteristic.Having established the physiological basis of social order in the first volume, Rey devoted his second to three dimensions of the social condition: ideology, or the study of ideas, phrenology, or the study of sentiment or feelings, and praxeology, the study of human action. According to Rey, ideology revealed that among the four properties of the living, that which predominated in the individual was what he called. He contended that \u2018on one hand, all our INTELLECTUAL existence has its foundation in the faculty that we have to PERCEIVE a part of those impressions that are made in us, and, on the other hand, that the exertion of this faculty, or what is called INTELLIGENCE, is entirely dependent on the ORGANS in which these functions take place\u2019.[CITATION-89] Against Cousin\u2019s eclecticism, and the spiritualist philosophy of Maine de Biran and his followers Jouffroy and Damiron, Rey drew attention to the fact that he was advancing ideas inspired by Tracy and the, while taking them much further. Reminding readers of Aristotle\u2019s observation that \u2018there is nothing in the mind that has not previously emerged from the senses\u2019, Rey declared that thought was nothing more than \u2018a function of the brain\u2019; that it could not be conceived of without a system of physical organs that received and processed these impressions.[CITATION-90] The individual\u2019s differential and selective treatment of impressions made it possible to move to the level of phrenology, the \u2018affective and sentimental movements.\u2019 Affectability was the \u2018faculty of being AFFECTED in various senses, with consciousness of this affection\u2019. And consciousness prompted intelligence to guide the reception, selection and use of our sense impressions in conformity with the dominant idiosyncrasy of the individual. For the individual, this idiosyncrasy was expressed in terms of sympathy for one\u2019s neighbour. Rey believed that this orientation was in the direction of goodness rather than evil; that it was directed toward human sociability (\u2018the dominant desire of our nature\u2019) rather than to individual selfishness. The realisation of this tendency depended on the \u2018science of the legislator\u2019, whose task was to foster those conditions in which social organisation encouraged sociability rather than selfishness. In an important departure from his earlier works, Rey argued that the legislator should not privilege coercion based on either the threat of punishment or the disciplining power of economic competition, the result of which was an unforgiving dog-eat-dog social order. Rather, he advocated a form of education, which, in treating all the human faculties equally, saw the teacher as a kind of Socratic tutor, who attended to their students with compassion by fostering their talents, and with the aim of achieving their fullest intellectual, moral and physical development. This form of education, Rey concluded, would lead to \u2018a peaceful overhaul of social elements\u2019. What Rey proposed, unlike Bentham\u2019s felicific calculus, would result in an economy and form of social organisation that was genuinely authentic, achieving \u2018the greatest happiness of the greatest number\u2019. This, according to Rey, was the object of praxeology.The greatest happiness of the greatest number was, in Rey\u2019s words, the \u2018law of our SELF-INTEREST RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD\u2019, which, for him, accorded first and foremost with \u2018a rule of fair distribution\u2019.[CITATION-91] This rule was informed by a radical equality\u2014what he called \u2018true equality, modified by benevolence\u2019\u2014that led him to question the usual rules of distribution.[CITATION-92] Rey agreed wholeheartedly with Owen on this point, but he pushed the bounds of Owenite thought further. Finding inspiration in the work of the radical egalitarians of 1793, Rey questioned the Lockean foundation to liberal thought (and Destutt de Tracy\u2019s own premise regarding the foundation of political and social life), that labour and property were the key components of the self, that property was the medium through which human relations were conducted, and the means by which the self defined itself in space and time.[CITATION-93] While Rey conceded that labour was certainly an important source of wealth, it was not the only source, and as a result it had to be accompanied by guarantees for those unable to work: \u2018there must therefore be an exception to the material faculty of appropriation by work itself, and it is in favour of the incapacity to work that it must exist\u2019.[CITATION-94] Property and wealth might be based on work, but they were also grounded in another principle: benevolence. According to Rey, benevolence weakened the principle of competition by altering fundamentally the conception of equality on which the new reorganised society of sympathy and sociability rested. Rey believed that if one pursued effectively the quest for a just and caring society, the logic of inequality would be completely reversed: \u2018As long as equilibrium does not exist, it is not the principle ofthat must be promoted () but that of a piousin favour of the poor, because only it will conform with justice, with charity, with the satisfaction of the noblest moral impulses\u2019.[CITATION-95] In an indirect reproach to the ideological zealotry of the supporters of the Jacobin Republic, Rey argued that these ideals of benevolence and justice had to accommodate times of \u2018transition\u2019, with \u2018reformers\u2019 having to be attentive to social circumstances and adjust their actions accordingly. At the same time, he did not temper his indignation against established social and economic relations. He believed that social reformers subscribing to his ideals would logically reject the principles of conventional political economy and its scandalous \u2018systematic organisation of DISORDER\u2019, which consecrated \u2018absolute and disordered individualism\u2019, and ended with an \u2018extreme inequality of distribution\u2019.[CITATION-96] Rey believed that benevolence and justice would gradually transform injurious inclinations and actions, and, through the \u2018redesign of social elements\u2019, replace them with a culture of goodness. He contended that these transformative experiences had been achieved briefly at various junctures in human history, and that at the time he was writing one could witness their renewal. Proof appeared in the concrete examples of mutual aid and co-operative societies, savings banks, insurance companies, agricultural colonies and new economic ideas and theories; and also in transformed manners and morality. Rey highlighted developments in education and his own innovative contributions to pedagogy. In his view, reform achieved the transformation of the present not through a violent overthrow of the established order, but by a gradual modification of the system from within. It also projected the possibility of an altogether different order, based from its inception on human actions and institutions guided by principles of sociability and benevolence. Here, Rey drew on the insights of the Saint-Simonians, Fourierists and Owenites. Their ideals and promises for the future served to nourish a sentiment of hope. All revealed a deep dissatisfaction with the current social order and an aspiration to transform it fundamentally and positively. But on the critical issue of material distribution both Saint-Simonianism and Fourierism were unable to break with the notions of competition, selection and classification. The Saint-Simonian maxim \u2018from each according to his ability, to each according to his works\u2019, and the Fourierist prescription that saw wealth distribution within the Fourierist ideal community, the Phalanst\u00e8re, according to ratios of three-twelfths for capital: four-twelfths for talent: five-twelfths for work, left open the possibility of recreating inequalities, and therefore domination, mistrust and social division.Rey\u2019s treatise ended with Owen\u2019s \u2018plan of the co-operative community\u2019, which, with its ideas on environment, education and, above all, radical equality, would, in Rey\u2019s words, succeed in \u2018ERADICATING AT ONCE the root of the evils born of the principle of INDIVIDUALISM\u2019.[CITATION-97] failed to achieve the widespread readership or favourable public reception for which Rey had hoped, falling prey to doctrinal divisions among socialists and rejection by liberals. Auguste Comte praised Rey for having identified the \u2018fundamental crisis that agitates modern society, and chart[ing] the only course that can lead to a real and definitive solution\u2019.[CITATION-98] But Adolphe Blanqui reproached him for being \u2018a little antimachinist\u2019.[CITATION-99] The most notable response came from L\u00e9on Brothier. His lengthy review article inpraised Rey\u2019s work for its vision and thoroughgoing critique of conventional political economy. Brothier was convinced by the egalitarian thrust of Rey\u2019s argument, yet he maintained that the Saint-Simonian adherence to \u2018capacity\u2019 was fundamentally correct. In response to Rey, he argued for the abolition of the proletariat and proposed the creation of a minimum guaranteed income based on the formula, which Marx would later appropriate, \u2018from each according to his works, to each according to his needs\u2019. What Brothier advocated was thus a union between Saint-Simonianism and Owenism.[CITATION-100] Rey remained in Angers until 1839. He then returned to his native Grenoble, where from 1844 he served as a city councillor. It was in Grenoble that he embarked on a series of practical social reforming initiatives, including a school for the deaf and mute, an orphanage, a nursery for the children of the poor, an agricultural colony for young offenders, and an industrial-agricultural colony at the confluence of the Drac and Is\u00e8re rivers, which was to be dedicated to education and the elimination of poverty. All of these initiatives he conceived of as part of what he termed \u2018transitional socialism\u2019. But this transition was, Rey believed, jeopardised by a fatal competition that existed between the various schools of socialist thought. It became Rey\u2019s burning ambition to reconcile them, with the aim (anticipating Marx and Engels\u2019 later efforts) of establishing a unified socialist movement that could challenge the July Monarchy. In marked contrast to Marx and Engels, who took pleasure in disparaging their socialist rivals, Rey believed that the only way to achieve a united socialism was by promoting a constant dialogue between the various parties. What he termed the \u2018rallying\u2019 cause depended on a formula of dialogue, equalisation and co-operation. This formula was characteristic of Rey, who had always sought to empathise with his interlocutors and engage with them sympathetically and respectfully in the spirit of enquiry and accommodation. Rey first tried to engage with fellow socialists at a theoretical level, by writing a critical history of social reforming movements and initiatives from antiquity to his present day. He saw in these historical developments a deep agreement between socialist ideas that rendered differences irrelevant. His \u2018Histoire critique des tentatives d\u2019am\u00e9lioration sociale depuis les temps les plus recul\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 nos jours\u2019 remained, however, unfinished.[CITATION-101] From the turn of 1840, through to the revolution of 1848, Rey also sought to fulfil his goal by studying, and corresponding with, leading socialists.Throughout these years, Rey remained a firm supporter of Owenism. In 1837, when Owen\u2019s arrival in Paris was announced, Jules Gay contacted Rey and the correspondence that ensued discussed the creation of a journal and a co-operative. It evoked the pioneering experience of 1828, and discussed supporters and possible allies in France and England.[CITATION-102] Nine years later, in 1846, T.W. Thornton, the French translator of Owen\u2019s, acknowledged Rey as the apostle of the doctrine of community in France.[CITATION-103] To both Gay and Thornton, Rey expressed the same idea, which was that \u2018after having conscientiously studied the views of Saint-Simon and Fourier \u2026 I still remained convinced that in relation to the fundamental principle of association, only Owen\u2019s conception of it can eliminate the source of all social divisions, and develop to the highest degree the feelings of benevolence, without which there can be no genuine harmony\u2019.[CITATION-104] Rey recognised the need to adapt the spirit of Owenism to the French context and hence in the early 1840s situated himself between the two main doctrines then vying to dominate socialism in France: Fourierism and Communism. He undertook a thoroughgoing analysis of key works and engaged intelligently and constructively in discussions and debates.\u2018A new era has just begun for the world\u2019, proclaimed France\u2019s first communist gathering, or, which was held in Belleville in July 1840. The \u2018new era\u2019 to which this referred evoked the memory of 1793 and the ideals and aspirations of the Jacobin republic.[CITATION-105] Rey followed this with interest. He read Th\u00e9odore D\u00e9zamy\u2019s and \u00c9tienne Cabet\u2019s works and corresponded with the neo-Babouvistes of the newspaper. An exchange of letters between him and the paper\u2019s editor Beno\u00eet Voisin, a cobbler by profession, reveals Rey\u2019s enthusiasm for what Voisin and contributors towere doing. He praised the role workers played in writing the newspaper and the way they drew inspiration and ideas from D\u00e9zamy\u2019s(1842). These worker-authors were, in Rey\u2019s estimation, \u2018the purest representatives [of] the egalitarian school\u2019, sharing with him a fundamental belief in the bedrock of Owenism, \u2018the equal enjoyment of social benefits by all members of the community\u2019.[CITATION-106] Even more intensely, Rey\u2019s lengthy correspondence with Cabet in 1846 signalled the close proximities between Voisin and his contributors\u2019 ideas and those of Babeuf and Owen. Rey was sympathetic to the Babouviste leanings of these rebellious workers, and he even partly absolved this communism for its violence, seeing it as a natural and entirely justifiable reaction to the far more severe and systematic violence perpetrated by the economic and political order of the July Monarchy. Despite Rey\u2019s praise for Voisin and those writing for, his correspondence reveals concerns over the potential for the neo-Babouvists to become dogmatic and domineering in their zeal for a new egalitarian society. Rey laid out four conditions that had to be respected in making the new model world. First, the new community had to be governed by the principle of non-coercion, especially in labour and social co-operation. Secondly, the new community could not impose on individuals any particular belief system. Empiricism and materialism had to give free rein to individuals\u2019 choices of belief. Yet he believed firmly that the new community had to be governed by an ideal of justice, which, in functioning as a regulative principle, guided individuals and the society in their actions. Here, he recalled the Owenite belief in the centrality of environmental factors for shaping character and actions. This point served as the prelude to his third condition, which was to abandon the individualising notions of virtue and will, which appeared in the neo-Babouvist discourse. These republican ideas ran counter to the equality of the just society. Instead, they buttressed individuality, capacity and hierarchy. Fourthly, Rey expressed his complete agreement with the neo-Babouvists in their shunning of elites and insistence that the movement for social reform had to be animated and directed from the bottom up. But he also signalled that this movement should proceed gradually and opt for small-scale experiments: \u2018a single limited experiment, well done, would be of an irresistible power\u2019.[CITATION-107] Rey believed in the necessity of achieving a fully united communist movement, especially as this would become an irresistible force of reform, leading to a new egalitarian society. For Rey, achieving this end could only come about through a Fourierism that endorsed his form of egalitarian socialism. Victor Considerant\u2019s(1839\u201344), with its appeal to \u2018un, un, une DECOUVERTE SOCIALE\u2019, openly endorsed Rey\u2019s egalitarian socialism.[CITATION-108] Around 1845, Rey exchanged several letters with Considerant while the latter was editing the journal.[CITATION-109] The correspondence, and a parallel one with D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Laverdant, centred on questions of infant schools and education more broadly. These letters also reveal Rey\u2019s belief in communism\u2019s ability to formalise the ideals of the future community, especially on the issue of radical equality. Fourierism, though deficient on the question of redistributive justice, would lend communism a practical dimension\u2014especially on the matters of enjoyable and stimulating labour, non-coercion and a broad-minded and accepting attitude to small-scale experimentation\u2014that was critical to the transition to the new egalitarian era. Rey\u2019s commitment to such social experimentation is also revealed in letters to the poet and cabinetmaker Antoine Boissy, who sought to establish a version of the open schools devoted to the propagation of Fourier\u2019s ideas, the so-called. Boissy\u2019s proposal for anwas, in Rey\u2019s estimation, significant and praiseworthy. Boissy conceived of it as a \u2018small scale\u2019 association that, in its aim to examine questions pertaining to the \u2018organisation of labour and the association between labour and capital\u2019, would draw on people\u2019s lived experience, and he wanted the initiative to stem from workers themselves.[CITATION-110] The extent to which Rey believed different socialist schools could rally to the cause of radical egalitarianism was also made clear in correspondence with Alfred Raginel, a communist who rubbed shoulders with Buonarroti in prison, was closely allied to Fourierism, and advocated the creation of a phalanstery that he called.[CITATION-111] While acknowledging the divisions and quarrels between the different socialist schools, especially the communists and Fourierists, Rey suggested to Raginel that the 1840s presented an opportunity requiring compromise. Circumstances necessitated that communists should yield to Fourierism, an \u2018already very satisfactory system\u2019. They could be confident that Fourierism itself would in future transform itself into \u2018the fully egalitarian system\u2019.[CITATION-112] Shortly before the Revolution of 1848, Rey summarised his views in his last published work,. Here he argued that, faced with \u2018the present state of instability and collapse\u2019, a \u2018science of government\u2019 worthy of the name was now possible.[CITATION-113] This \u2018science\u2019, which combined theory and practice, would carry out the theoretical work of reflection, and mobilise both the enlightened masses and social reformers. Some little time before Marx and Engels highlighted in thethe power of technology, factory organisation and infrastructure to unite workers, Rey suggested that the liberating qualities of the sciences and the arts could be joined to new \u2018methods of communication of thought\u2019, which, through developments in the press and telecommunications infrastructure such as railways and telegraphs, would serve the same aim. These powers were \u2018immense\u2019, and their revolutionary potential boundless.[CITATION-114] Rey believed it necessary to bring together classical republican preoccupations with questions of sovereignty and suffrage with socialist preoccupations with the social question. He also argued for the unification of the different socialist factions. He concurred with the Fourierists who stressed how human nature aligned with the pacificism and absence of coercion of any future association. This invited experimentation and opened the door to the introduction of, first, a \u2018guaranteed MINIMUM [income]\u2019 that \u2018comprised the fullest satisfaction of all basic needs, with all possible assistance in cases of illness and infirmity, and second, the benefits of a complete education for children, as well as the enjoyment of all means of development arising from the arts and sciences\u2019.[CITATION-115] This was coupled with a broad programme of guaranteed rights and a plan to regulate distribution. Missing from this salutary Fourierist agenda was the critical (and Owenite) idea of \u200b\u200ba \u2018community of goods and equality of distribution\u2019.[CITATION-116] In ascribing this idea to communism more generally and its promise of a future community governed by the radical equality of the community of goods, Rey indicated that \u2018communists\u2019 had first to revise their understanding of labour and alienation and then to adopt what he believed to be the more enlightened and self-affirming understanding of labour, with its ability co-operatively to unite diverse personalities and interests that was at the core of Owenism.[CITATION-117] Owen, Rey suggested, had anticipated the synthesis between the different types of socialism that he himself was proposing.[CITATION-118] Shortly before the publication of, Rey wrote a revealing letter to Cabet. He stated that after years of studying thoroughly the ideas of the Saint-Simonians and those of Fourier and other socialist schools, he had never been \u2018for a single moment shaken from the completely egalitarian and communist convictions that I had brought back from England\u2019.[CITATION-119] In May 1849, Rey ran for legislative office as a candidate for his native Grenoble. He began his political manifesto with a bold pledge: to ensure \u2018the rigorous application of JUSTICE in the distribution of social benefits\u2019 and to end \u2018for those who already possess in excess\u2019 an accumulation of wealth which was injurious to \u2018those who do not have the necessities of life, or for those who find it difficult to obtain them\u2019.[CITATION-120] That simple and bold statement of political intent encapsulated Rey\u2019s life\u2019s work. It was not just a politically revolutionary programme; it was also a statement of intellectual synthesis. In drawing on what were, by the middle of the nineteenth century, comparatively peripheral elements of French political culture (Tracy and), and on a conspicuously English approach to political and social thinking embodied especially in the work of Bentham and Owen, Rey was able to fashion an oeuvre that, by modernising and adapting to new industrial times, succeeded in regenerating the revolutionary legacy of 1793. This remarkable synthesis proved to be one of the most intellectually rigorous counterweights to the kind of political liberalthat Rey\u2019s former allies in the conspiratorial politics of the 1820s had adopted as their own by the time of the July Monarchy. This intellectual synthesis rested on a perspicacity characteristic of Rey\u2019s political judgement, one that allowed him to see clearly that at the heart of much of socialism, especially the kind of Saint-Simonianism embodied in the formula \u2018from each according to his abilities to each according to his works\u2019, was the liberal idea of capacity. Rey believed this led to the most \u2018extreme inequalities\u2019 and betrayed socialism\u2019s.At the heart of Rey\u2019s critique of liberalism, and much of French socialism, lay a judicious understanding that, by embracing the idea of capacity or ability, socialism would arrive at an intellectual impasse and betray the cause of social justice. Rey\u2019s reflections came at a critical time in the life of French and European socialism, and may also speak to our present. In recent decades, when many advanced polities have witnessed a crisis of socialism, commentators have noted that the solutions on offer, rooted in a vision of a meritocratic society that appears to cut across class, race, gender and culture by elevating an idea of personal ability, leads, ironically, to new inequalities.[CITATION-121] It should therefore come as no surprise that some years ago President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s brand of socialism was equated with \u2018a kind of Saint-Simonianism\u2019,[CITATION-122] or that, more recently, Emmanuel Macron was dubbed \u2018the spiritual son of Saint-Simonianism\u2019.[CITATION-123] Rey\u2019s verdict on that particular intellectualof nineteenth-century socialism holds up a mirror to the politics of the twenty-first century.",
