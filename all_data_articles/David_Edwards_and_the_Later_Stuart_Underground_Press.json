    "article": "This article investigates the English underground press in the later Stuart period. Following the end of pre-publication licensing in 1695, the ongoing threat of government reprisals meant that controversial political and religious tracts continued to be printed in secret; yet the survival of the underground press into this period has been neglected in recent works of political, religious, social, cultural and literary history. The dominant view, established by some of the most influential book historians of the past century, is that the materials necessary for a study of secret printing do not survive. This article argues otherwise. Through a detailed case-tudy of the career of one such printer, David Edwards, it illustrates how the clandestine activities of a subset of printers helped shape contemporary debate. Combining historical and bibliographical modes of investigation, this article explores the fundamental mechanics of how controversial tracts, written and printed in secret, reached the public. It examines Edwards\u2019s training under the Whig printer Thomas Braddyll, his subsequent links to the exiled Jacobite court, the clandestine techniques he used to disguise his activities, and the authorship of books he printed. These included the use of indentures and tokens to ensure against imposters and tweaking copy texts to mask distinctive stylistic tics. The article concludes by arguing that the vibrant culture of partisan print associated with the later Stuart public sphere was enabled not solely by the demise of pre-publication licensing in 1695, but also by the persistence of the underground press.The production of books in early modern England was both a commercial activity and an ideological one. This was particularly true during the later Stuart period, when a fitfully imposed system of pre-publication censorship restricted the printing and publication of unlicensed books.[CITATION-1] Even after the collapse of the licensing regime in 1695, men and women involved in the underground book trade continued to be subject to harsh penalties for the crimes of seditious libel and treason: informal harassment, arrest, imprisonment, the pillory, and in one extreme case execution.[CITATION-2] In the eyes of the law, printers, publishers and booksellers were no less responsible than authors for the \u2018making\u2019 of libels.[CITATION-3] Many were intellectually and ideologically engaged in the works they produced. By issuing new polemical works, or repackaging older texts for new audiences, members of the book trade made their own distinct interventions in contemporary political debate.[CITATION-4] The \u2018prime mover\u2019 in all these activities, writes Ian Green, \u2018was not the printer or the bookseller but the publisher\u2019.[CITATION-5] Much recent scholarship rests on this assumption. Literary scholars have tended to concentrate either on giants of the trade such as Jacob Tonson or on characterful rogues such as Edmund Curll.[CITATION-6] Where historians of early modern political thought have ventured into the terrain of book history, their focus has likewise been on the intellectual milieux of publishers: of John Streater, who published the works of James Harrington, or of Thomas Hobbes\u2019s publisher William Crooke.[CITATION-7] Printers, on the other hand, were driven by \u2018business acumen, rather than political enthusiasm\u2019.[CITATION-8] Yet the truth is that the distinction between printers and publishers in the later Stuart period was far from clear-cut. Some printers absorbed the functions of publishers and distributors, particularly when approached directly by authors, as was commonplace.[CITATION-9] No less than the publishers and booksellers alongside whom they worked, printers were not neutral vehicles for the communication of texts, but could be ideological agents in their own right.Building on the erratic prosopographical research of Henry R. Plomer, there is now a rich vein of scholarship demonstrating that printers operated according to their political convictions.[CITATION-10] George Larkin was well known among Whigs for his radical sympathies, as was Francis Smith.[CITATION-11] John Darby collaborated with John Toland and the Whig commonwealthmen to generate a celebrated canon of oppositional literature in the 1690s.[CITATION-12] Nathaniel Mist was a notorious Jacobite, who, despite repeatedly falling foul of the law, refused to turn his coat.[CITATION-13] Recent work on the Quaker press has reinforced the sense that authors employed printers drawn from their own community, notably Andrew Sowle and, after 1695, his daughter Tace.[CITATION-14] Other printers, like Henry Hills, were reviled and assailed for their confessional tergiversations.[CITATION-15] Many of these printers operated at the fringes of the profession, covertly producing seditious pamphlets. They were elusive in their lifetimes and remain so today. Few printers left behind archives, account books or inventories, presenting a significant methodological hurdle.[CITATION-16] Donald McKenzie, one of the modern pioneers of \u2018the history of the book\u2019, observed that whereas Robert Darnton and subsequent historians of the French underground press have been \u2018richly served by their archival records, there is nothing comparable for seventeenth-century England\u2019. Even by the end of the century, the government\u2019s \u2018fitful and inefficient censorship has left few telling accounts to enliven our reports of those affected by it\u2019. For McKenzie, this lack of documentation prompted a methodological reliance on \u2018two invaluable tools\u2019: the archives of the Stationers\u2019 Company and the, which a generation of book historians have used to direct the kinds of inquiries which McKenzie thought \u2018most profitable\u2019.[CITATION-17] And yet such an approach has also proved extremely limiting. After the lapse of the Printing Act (sometimes called the \u2018Licensing Act\u2019, though its remit was much broader than that name suggests) the Stationers\u2019 Company relinquished much of its control over the book trade. Its records become less useful. On the other hand, theis limited by the information contained on title pages. While the imprints of controversial political tracts occasionally list the identities of publishers and booksellers, they seldom name printers.[CITATION-18] Most such pamphlets are, as one scholar has recently put it, \u2018nothing shy of a bibliographical mess\u2019.[CITATION-19] Fearful of prosecution, printers of political tracts guarded their identities with various typographical tricks. Consequently, the vast majority of any individual printer\u2019s output has gone unseen by those historians who are trained to look only at imprints and catalogues, and not at ornaments, watermarks, and typography, as David R. Como has done with pamphlets from the English civil wars.[CITATION-20] Despite acknowledging that roughly half of printed matter in the later seventeenth century appeared anonymously, and that bibliographical analysis might be used \u2018to attribute anonymous work and refine the figures\u2019, McKenzie made no attempt to reckon with this \u2018uncomfortable fact\u2019 and instead focused his attention on prestige literary texts issued by reliable publishers.[CITATION-21] One unfortunate result of these entrenched methodological priorities is that, while much has now been written about the output and connections of individual members of the book trade, the basic activities of the underground press remain something of a mystery.My arguments here are both methodological and substantial. By combining the skills and techniques of the historian with those of the bibliographer, we stand to learn more than previously thought possible about the methods of clandestine printers in this period, and how those methods were entangled with their ideological commitments. Using personal correspondence, government papers and legal records alongside a forensic bibliographical examination of printed books, this article constructs for the first time a detailed portrait of one such printer: David Edwards. Contrary to McKenzie\u2019s assumption that government censorship \u2018left few telling accounts\u2019 of the later Stuart underground press, Edwards\u2019s numerous brushes with the law laid a rich trail of documents which provides a unique snapshot of the inner workings of a clandestine printing house. My aim in what follows is to illuminate the hidden but fundamental mechanics of how controversial texts were printed and distributed\u2014the processes that occurred between a manuscript leaving an author\u2019s desk and a finished pamphlet arriving in a bookshop; to illustrate how printers changed texts, added to them, disguised, transformed and repackaged them.This case-study reveals Edwards to have been one of the most prolific and controversial printers active during the decade following the lapse of the Printing Act in 1695.[CITATION-22] Although this period is usually considered one of substantial change in the book trade, and in the history of communication more generally, close examination of these records instead reveals deep continuities with earlier decades.[CITATION-23] Edwards may have specialised in the manufacture of Jacobite and Catholic books, but his strategies and techniques closely resemble those of the nonconformist printers under whom he trained. Those old strategies endured after the lapse of the Act precisely because the end of licensing did not constitute the end of censorship. Instead, the continuing activities of the underground press laid the foundation for a reinvigorated literary opposition in post-revolutionary England, with a vibrant but secretive print culture to mirror the clandestine scribal circulation of libellous texts. The covert arrangements surrounding the printing and publication of these texts were a crucial factor in ensuring their extensive public impact. The final section of this article will outline how, by shielding authors from state retribution, Edwards and his fellow underground printers performed a vital role in sustaining the later Stuart public sphere.It is first necessary to situate Edwards\u2019s career as an underground printer against the backdrop of his early training. He was bound as an apprentice to Thomas Braddyll on 2 July 1683, for the duration of seven years, having travelled from the family home in Bodfari, a tiny village in a stridently royalist part of Denbighshire.[CITATION-24] Although Edwards had no family ties to the London book trade, there were local connections. At nearby Galltfaenan Hall lived Robert Salusbury, whose two sons, Thomas and John, were both apprentice stationers.[CITATION-25] It may be that Edwards\u2019s father, a minor yeoman, arranged his son\u2019s apprenticeship through his neighbour. Scanning imprints in thegives the impression that Braddyll was strictly a jobbing printer. Yet those titles are merely the tip of a much larger iceberg, for a good deal of Braddyll\u2019s trade was in surreptitious Whig propaganda. According to his fellow dissenting bookseller, John Dunton, Braddyll was:a first-rate Printer, and has always been a very active, diligent man. He is religiously true to his word, and faithful to the Booksellers that employ him, of which his making no discovery of two thousand Books I once burned in an oven is, to me at least, a very pregnant instance.[CITATION-26] The identity of Dunton\u2019s cremated books remains a mystery. But in 1680 the dissenting publisher Nathaniel Ponder accused Braddyll and \u2018five of his Confederates\u2019 of printing a surreptitious edition of John Bunyan\u2019s(1678) in \u2018a base old letter, almost worn out, hardly to be read\u2019, and denounced him and his workers as a crew of \u2018\u2019.[CITATION-27] In November 1680, Braddyll was named by the publisher Richard Janeway as one of six printers whom he had hired to print, a savage example of Whig polemic, which, in the judgement of the House of Commons, contained \u2018several Reflections\u2019 on the conduct of Sir Edward Dering.[CITATION-28] Seven months later, on 6 June 1681, the Stationers\u2019 Company resolved to \u2018goe to Counsell about the Bye Law concerning a Presse in a hole & about Mr Bradylls breach thereof\u2019, referring to an ordinance of 1678 which prohibited \u2018any Private Presse or Presses commonly called a Presse in a hole\u2019.[CITATION-29] That Braddyll was printing illicit material on this private press is indicated by his reaction when Roger L\u2019Estrange\u2019s deputy and messenger of press, Robert Stephens, was instructed to search the premises in December:The said Master and Wardens with Robert Stephens, coming two several times to the Printing House of one Thom. Bradyll Printer (a member of the Company of Stationers) they were both times, not only after several demands refused Entrance, but reflected upon and abused; By reason whereof the said Master & Wardens were not able to give any account what the said Bradyll was Printing, which the said Stephens does belive may be of ill Consequence, he keeping all his doors Locked against them.[CITATION-30] Braddyll\u2019s nonconformist associates come into clearer focus during the months surrounding the discovery of the Rye House Plot. In November 1682, Braddyll printed three sheets of, an anonymous sequel to Andrew Marvell\u2019s celebratedof 1677. The originalwas printed by John Darby senior with a false Amsterdam imprint; thewas printed in London with a false Cologne imprint.[CITATION-31] The job had been outsourced by the Baptist publisher Francis Smith junior and split across several presses, a common strategy to lend printers a veneer of deniability.[CITATION-32] In the following May, Braddyll learned of an active warrant for his arrest and, with \u2018matters look[ing] a little dark upon him\u2019, surrendered himself to the authorities.[CITATION-33] Although he claimed that the relevant sheets had been printed by his wife in his absence, \u2018with protestations that he knew nothing of ydoing it\u2019, that seems an unlikely story.[CITATION-34] Under interrogation, Braddyll confessed to L\u2019Estrange that he was close with the men he thought responsible for the book: \u2018About a month since, he saw,,,, And, at a Tavern together, here in the Town. (Not Ferguson, as I thought: but he was mentioned upon another Occasion)\u2019.[CITATION-35] Those were significant names. About Robert Ferguson much has been written, not least regarding his instrumental role in the abortive Rye House Plot.[CITATION-36] Aaron Smith was a stalwart of the Green Ribbon Club and a well-known Whig agitator.[CITATION-37] There is a tantalising possibility that \u2018Starkey\u2019 was the Whig bookseller John Starkey, who published major works of republicanism by Henry Neville, James Harrington and Machiavelli, alongside the later writings of Milton.[CITATION-38] More likely, though, this was Samuel Starkey, who acted as clerk to Aaron Smith, and who would soon turn state\u2019s evidence against his former master.[CITATION-39] The Baptist Samuel Harris was a close associate of republican Green Ribbonites such as John Ayloffe and John Wildman, knew John Locke well, and had energetically promoted Whig petitions.[CITATION-40] In 1686, it was put about that he had \u2018disperse[d] many of the late dangerous papers\u2019 and \u2018would rather loose his life than to change his Principall whe declares to be agall maner of Kingly Government\u2019.[CITATION-41] Thomas Dare was another extreme Whig, whose house in Amsterdam has been described by Richard Ashcraft as \u2018headquarters of radicalism\u2019 in the city.[CITATION-42] \u2018Whitacre\u2019 is almost certainly the lawyer Edward Whitaker, memorably labelled by one newsletter writer \u2018yCommon Solicitor for all Phanaticks\u2019.[CITATION-43] Early in 1683, while Braddyll was purportedly meeting with this group, the informant Sir Robert Vyner mentioned Whitaker as one of those \u2018well known for crown stealers\u2019.[CITATION-44] Another turncoat implicated him in a late \u2018designe for yAssassination of his Ma& Royall Highness as they should goe abroad by water or Land\u2019.[CITATION-45] After much examination, Braddyll was \u2018positive\u2019 that the manuscript ofwas written in Whitaker\u2019s hand, with which he was already familiar.[CITATION-46] On 7 June 1683, L\u2019Estrange reported that \u2018By Braddil and by Braddils means I doubt not (if I be left to me selfe) to do yKing some Considerable service\u2019, presumably catching the author of.[CITATION-47] And yet the next mention of Braddyll comes after his workshop was raided roughly a fortnight later, on 23 June, by Sir Philip Lloyd. Through the spring and summer of 1683, Lloyd had been investigating the Rye House conspirators. As part of his duties for the Secretary of State he ran spies among the radical Whigs: he was the point of contact for Nathaniel Hartshorne, a double agent who infiltrated the chambers of Richard Goodenough and witnessed him scheming with John Ayloffe and others on how best to kill the king.[CITATION-48] It was Lloyd who, on 26 June, just three days after the raid on Braddyll\u2019s workshop, seized the papers of Algernon Sidney, including the damning manuscript of the.[CITATION-49] So his simultaneous interest in Braddyll is significant. During his inquiries, Lloyd received a tip-off about \u2018a Hamper\u2019 that was sent to the printer from the house of Robert West, one of the leading conspirators. Lloyd stormed Braddyll\u2019s shop to discover that his informants were mistaken; the hamper had in fact been sent to that other radical printer, John Darby senior. L\u2019Estrange suspected foul play: \u2018It was a palpable Abuse, for they do know; (Both of them) that Braddyl does not live in St Bartholomews Close; if the Information poynted thither: And then that Darby the Printer, does Live there: as dangerous, and Desperate an Anabaptist as lives\u2019.[CITATION-50] Could Braddyll have been in on the deception? Or was he being framed as Darby\u2019s stooge, in retribution for collaborating with the government?Edwards started his apprenticeship less than a fortnight after Braddyll\u2019s workshop was raided on suspicion of involvement in the Rye House Plot. After this brush with the law, Braddyll kept a low profile. His imprint barely appears over the years of Edwards\u2019s apprenticeship: between 1683 and 1689 he is mentioned as the printer of only three books listed in the, none of which contains controversial material. And yet the survival of his business indicates that he must have continued to produce pamphlets, books or primers in secret, without advertising his role. Edwards learned about clandestine printing from a virtuoso: how to cover one\u2019s dealings with authors and publishers and booksellers; how to design false imprints; which ornaments and founts could be traced and which could not; which booksellers he could trust and which he ought to avoid; when to resist questioning, and, equally importantly, when to admit defeat and co-operate with the government. He learned those lessons from his master but did not, as we shall now see, inherit his views on politics or religion. For Edwards used his knowledge to assist Braddyll\u2019s enemies: the Tories, the Catholics, and the Jacobites.Edwards was \u2018sworne and admitted into the Freedome\u2019 of the Stationers\u2019 Company on 6 April 1691.[CITATION-51] He worked as a journeyman for another three years before setting up on his own in 1694, in rented premises on Nevil\u2019s Alley, off Fetter Lane. Those were a tumultuous three years for the London book trade. Despite the nominal control over the press offered by pre-publication licensing, the Jacobite press flourished.[CITATION-52] As one commentator observed in 1693, it \u2018appears the Law is far insufficient to the end which it intends. Do we not see, not once or oftner, but weekly, nay daily, that continuedagainst our present happy Establishment, are printed and dispersed amongst us; for all thatcan do?\u2019[CITATION-53] This state of affairs prompted a government crackdown on the underground press, particularly the three major Jacobite printers in London.The first to be targeted was the printer William Canning.[CITATION-54] On 8 November 1692, Canning\u2019s primary distributor, Anne Merryweather, was committed to Newgate following a brilliant sting operation by the government spy Dr Richard Kingston.[CITATION-55] A warrant followed soon thereafter for a messenger to \u2018search for seditious and unlicensed papers or pamphlets\u2019 at Merryweather\u2019s house.[CITATION-56] Kingston advised that she had a secret cubby-hole \u2018between the seeling of the roofe and the partition wall of the house, so private that it is believed it is not yet found out; there she alwaies hid her private papers\u2019.[CITATION-57] Although Merryweather initially held out under interrogation, \u2018having resolved rather to dye honourably than live basely\u2019, the prospect of death by burning eventually loosened her lips.[CITATION-58] On the eve of her execution, Merryweather declared her intentions to \u2018discover her accomplices, and those that set her on work, provided she may have her pardon\u2019.[CITATION-59] A flurry of warrants for underground printers followed John Trenchard\u2019s appointment as Secretary of State in the following spring.[CITATION-60] On 2 May, the press of William Anderton, \u2018whence most of the Jacobite books have come\u2019, was discovered in a secret room at a carpenter\u2019s workshop in Westminster.[CITATION-61] Anderton had previously evaded capture in Hoxton in 1691 and again more recently at locations around Soho and Shoreditch, where he was running a secret press under the alias \u2018Thomas Topham\u2019.[CITATION-62] He was convicted for printing two treasonable pamphlets and duly sentenced to die by the gallows, though not before he offered \u2018to discover to save his life\u2019.[CITATION-63] On the day the warrant for his execution was signed, Narcissus Luttrell reported further orders \u2018for taking up 36 severall persons concerned in the trade of libells\u2019.[CITATION-64] The third and last of the major Jacobite presses to fall was run by David Douglas on Peter Street. His two principal workers were William Newbolt and Edward Butler, both of whom were entrapped in July 1693 by the double agent William Chaloner, who had commissioned them to print forty illegal Jacobite declarations to be \u2018sent to a private gentleman in the country\u2019.[CITATION-65] Under threat of death, they too co-operated and \u2018accused severall who were concerned in printing and dispersing the declarations\u2019.[CITATION-66] Unlike Anderton, their lives were spared.[CITATION-67] By the time Edwards set up on his own in 1694, then, all three major Jacobite presses in London had been compromised. But the secret networks that supplied the printers with copy remained intact. Edwards was probably first introduced to those networks soon after marrying Mary Daniel, whose deceased stepfather was the notable Catholic printer Nathaniel Thompson, and whose widowed mother had inherited her husband\u2019s printing equipment.[CITATION-68] Gathering materials from the Thompson press, Edwards began to make his mark. In the autumn of 1694, Trenchard issued a warrant for Stephens to \u2018make strickt and diligent search for David Edwards a Printer and him having found you are to apprehend and secure for treasonable and seditious practices\u2019.[CITATION-69] He was seized the following day, though seemingly not prosecuted. The first sign that Edwards was tapping into secret Jacobite networks occurs in 1695, when he printed two Catholic books by \u2018J. C.\u2019. An annotated copy in Ushaw College of one of the books,, attributes it to James \u2018Maurus\u2019 Corker, a prominent Benedictine priest and servant of the exiled Stuarts.[CITATION-70] According to William Fuller, a quondam Jacobite courier and spy, Corker returned frequently to London carrying messages from the exiled court to its allies at home.[CITATION-71] Possibly Edwards encountered Corker through his wife or mother-in-law, both of whom were Catholic relatives of the Jacobite adventurer James Counter.[CITATION-72] Nathaniel Thompson had printed and sold pamphlets for Corker during the Exclusion Crisis, so this seems a likely connection.[CITATION-73] Alternatively, Edwards may have liaised with Jacobite contacts at his preferred watering hole, the Dog Tavern, where, one of his regular authors, William Pittis, reported, Edwards drank \u2018with the rest of his Brethren\u2019.[CITATION-74] The Dog was well known as a den of Jacobite sympathisers and \u2018persons also suspected to be French spyes\u2019.[CITATION-75] On one occasion, the French ambassador himself was rumoured to have met with and \u2018Bowe[d] to a number of Jacobites that were got together at the Dog-Taverne\u2019.[CITATION-76] Here Edwards would have been able to advertise his services and make useful connections among home-grown and foreign agents.On 27 July 1695, Trenchard\u2019s replacement as Secretary of State, Sir William Trumbull, issued another warrant for taking up Edwards, who stood \u2018accused upon oath, for printing, publishing or dispersing Seditious and Treasonable Libells against the Government\u2019.[CITATION-77] This time the orders went to a younger agent, John Gellibrand. Two weeks later, Luttrell noted that the \u2018messenger of the presse has seised a private presse for printing in the custody of one Edwards, and with it many scurrilous pamphlets\u2019.[CITATION-78] The charges were not presented until 28 August, at which point no further action appears to have been taken.[CITATION-79] In the autumn, Stephens testified before the Privy Council that \u2018he lately seized a Booke as ysame was printing by one David Edwards, which he then produced Entituled, A Manuall of Prayers and other Christian Devotion, permissu Superiorum. Wherein are conteyned severall Seditious Matters\u2019.[CITATION-80] Illicit Catholic prayer books were a particular nuisance to the government of William III. Scouring the Thames customs house in October 1698, Gellibrand intercepted a \u2018great Quantity of Popish Books\u2019, including bibles printed in France which were destined for an unnamed \u2018bookseller in the Strand\u2019, and did so again in the following April.[CITATION-81] On 18 February 1699, several MPs complained about \u2018great Numbers of Popish Priests and Jesuits\u2019 in London who have \u2018imported great Quantities of Popish Books, and keep Schools to breed up and instruct Children in theSuperstition and Idolatry\u2019.[CITATION-82] One year later, James Vernon, the new Secretary of State, \u2018received Information that great numbers of Popish Books have been lately Imported\u2019.[CITATION-83] Vernon authorised Gellibrand to seize those books and arrest their \u2018Importers Vendors or Dispersers\u2019 wherever he found them. He had his work cut out. Another contemporary report neatly summarised the situation: \u2018Popish books are forbidden to be sold, but now the booksellers\u2019 shops are full of them\u2019.[CITATION-84] The standard view has long been that \u2018these editions were printed in Antwerp, Paris, or Rouen, with a move to London printers only in the eighteenth century\u2019;[CITATION-85] the numerous warrants for seizing \u2018Popish Books\u2019 at the customs house certainly suggest a thriving trade in smuggled books. Yet Stephens\u2019s testimony reveals that Edwards was already printing them in London in the 1690s. In 1695, Stephens confiscated the edition \u2018as ysame was printing\u2019, so one might assume that it was never published. There is, however, a lone copy in Lambeth Palace Library ofwhich matches Stephens\u2019s description exactly, albeit with the false imprint \u2018, | Printed in the Year, 1692\u2019. Despite the Paris imprint, the first flyleaf is annotated, \u2018David Edwards, ye printer\u2019.[CITATION-86] Its present location might suggest that this was the copy confiscated by Stephens. There are also two extant copies of another tiny octodecimo, \u2018Printed in the year, 1696\u2019, but without the \u2018Permissu Superiorum\u2019 tag. Thesuggests this is a \u2018Continental printing, possibly printed in France\u2019.[CITATION-87] However, the decorated \u2018O\u2019 initial is an exact match with an initial which appears on a broadside bearing the imprint of Mary Edwards \u2018inCourt in\u2019.[CITATION-88] Both the \u20181692\u2019and the 1696close with Jacobite \u2018Prayers for the King, Queen, and Queen Dowager, and Prince of\u2019, which explains the \u2018Seditious Matters\u2019 mentioned by Stephens.[CITATION-89] Possibly the latter book included some sheets missed during the raid. Certainly both examples were printed by Edwards.[CITATION-90] Further Catholic titles followed from the press on Nevil\u2019s Alley. Early in 1696, Edwards printed the tractby the Jesuit priest John Huddleston, alias \u2018Dormer\u2019.[CITATION-91] He later printed, a tuppenny broadside purportedly \u2018translated into English\u2019 from a copy \u2018Printed at Rome, by order from the Pope\u2019.[CITATION-92] Following the failed Jacobite assassination plot of 1696, Stephens once again looted Edwards\u2019s workshop and, hidden \u2018under the Press\u2019, found printed copies of a virulent libel entitled, damning William and his \u2018rebellious brood\u2019 with \u2018all the Plagues of Hell\u2019.[CITATION-93] On 8 July 1696, the printer was tried at the Old Bailey, where Stephens testified that he had detained Edwards \u2018several times for such Crimes, and it always proved to be Popish Work that he did Print\u2019.[CITATION-94] Successful prosecutions depended in part on political willpower; in the aftermath of the discovered plot, the government wanted to display some Jacobite scalps. Edwards was sentenced to pay a fine of \u00a350, to stand three times in the pillory, and to \u2018lye in prison till perform\u2019d\u2019.[CITATION-95] On his release, Edwards\u2019s contacts abroad continued to supply him with copy from Saint-Germain. After James II and VII died in 1701, Edwards rushed outand, in October, printed, which claimed to have been \u2018Written Originally inat St., And Dedicated to histhe. And now Translated into English with very little Alteration\u2019.[CITATION-96] Early in 1702, he received a copy of a circular letter from Chaillot detailing James\u2019s spiritual life in exile and the circumstances of his death. Edwards issued the text asand included his own \u2018Printer\u2019s Preface\u2019 explaining his rationale:[T]he following Sheets are a Translation from theOriginal, and come to me so solemnly recommended, that there is not the least Grounds to suspect, but that they are indeed the last Remains of this Good KingI hope it will not be expected, I should say anything in Apology for their Publication. I know the World is Base and Malicious enough, and but too apt to Censure falsly, and to make Insidious Conjectures, but the Honesty of the Design, and the Regard every Man ought to have for the Memory of this Great Prince, will I hope, not only Account for me, but withal recommend the Book it self successfully to the Publick.The Reader will find in every Sheet, the lively Effigies of a suffering Prince, and a Devout Christian, especially in his last Conversation, with his Queen and Children. There indeed He\u2019ll see the Picture of his injur\u2019d King drawn to the Life, and perhaps too, meet with some other Circumstances that will entirely Convince him, that he has been the most Abus\u2019d of all Mankind.\u2019Tis out of my Sphere, I confess, to enlarge upon these Matters; and yet I cannot help owning, but that there are many Passages in this little Book, so endearing Passionate and Pious, that a Man must be, in a Scripture Sense, past feeling, that is not Affected by \u2019em.[CITATION-97] This was an emotional rather than intellectual case for Jacobitism.[CITATION-98] Edwards believed his book could mobilise the sympathies of any reader who was not \u2018past feeling\u2019. The following year he anonymously printedfrom another smuggled manuscript: a transcript of David Nairne and John Caryll\u2019s \u2018extract\u2019 of James II\u2019s advice to his heir, to which he once again attached his own preface.[CITATION-99] It was not a public document, so Edwards must have enjoyed inside access to Jacobite papers through his French associates.One of the most controversial texts from this run of pamphlets was, written by the Irish Nonjuror David Fitzgerald and printed by Edwards in January 1703.[CITATION-100] The aim of this book was to reconcile Jacobite principles with the accession of Queen Anne, by arguing that she was right to accept the throne for three reasons: \u2018, to keep the Monarchy entire:, to keep the Crown, the Royal Authority, and the Power in her own Blood and Family; and, to keep St[range]rs out of theThrone\u2019.[CITATION-101] Her claim to the throne came solely from her ancestry. The tortured logic of this position was pointed out by John Toland, who thought it \u2018look\u2019d like a Design long conniv\u2019d at to under-mine the Queen\u2019s Title\u2019 and was appalled to see the pamphlet being sold outside Parliament.[CITATION-102] On 4 February, Charles Kenge was dispatched to arrest Edwards and, on 5 July, the printer was discharged on bail and bound to give evidence against Fitzgerald.[CITATION-103] On this occasion Edwards escaped the pillory, though Fitzgerald was sentenced to \u2018appear near the Courts in Westminster-hall, with a paper pinn\u2019d to his hat, specifying his crime\u2019. Decades later, John Oldmixon remembered this as \u2018a very moderate punishment, and what a zealous Irish Jacobite would rather have glorified in, than been asham\u2019d of\u2019.[CITATION-104] If, as Paul Monod has argued, the \u2018most important of all Jacobite underworlds was that of printers and publishers\u2019, then Edwards was the linchpin of that underworld.[CITATION-105] After the collapse of the Jacobite press in 1693, he became the go-to printer for agents of the exiled Stuarts. He remained so for a decade. Reflecting on his enemies in a private letter, Edwards once wrote \u2018The worst they cou\u2019d ever say of me, is, That I was a Jacobite, and I have suffer\u2019d severely for it\u2019.[CITATION-106] His suffering took the form of repeated imprisonment, fines, and the pillory. He was also a printer of Catholic books at a time when such books were considered seditious, and when few other London printers, if any, were engaged in their production.[CITATION-107] His wife was a Catholic; so too was his sister; although he and his brother both privately claimed to be in their \u2018Principle always for the Church of England\u2019, he praised James II in print as \u2018a Devout Christian\u2019.[CITATION-108] The evidence is unclear as to whether Edwards was a \u2018church papist\u2019, claiming without any obvious qualms to belong to the Church of England, or simply an Anglican open to appreciating the sincerity of Catholicism.[CITATION-109] But, to a substantial degree, the printer\u2019s claims show that he prioritised dynastic politics over issues of religion. Edwards was a Jacobite first and foremost. His press served his principles. He had no qualms about printing texts by either Catholics or nonjuring churchman, provided they supported his political creed.In 1696, the Stationers\u2019 Company filed a chancery suit against Edwards and two associates for printing primers and almanacs, over which the Company held a monopoly. Officials claimed they were \u2018not capable to make precise proof thereof\u2019 because Edwards had printed the books \u2018in soe clandestine and fraudulent a maner\u2019.[CITATION-110] Modern scholars face similar difficulties to those original Company officials. One can examine the finished books, collate them against manuscripts, compare ornaments and broken type, and trace the names supplied in imprints. But a host of questions about the inside mechanics of secret printing remain unanswered. How did printers receive texts? What strategies did they use to distribute pamphlets in secret? Where and with whom did they do their business? Did they edit manuscripts for publication and, if so, to what extent?Edwards was a specialist in surreptitious printing, which makes his activities all the more difficult to trace; but there is one exception. In 1705, Edwards printed, an anonymous pamphlet written by James Drake, probably in collaboration with Sir Humphrey Mackworth, Henry Poley, and other members of a shady cabal which met at the Devil Tavern.[CITATION-111] The book mounted a political case for enforced religious conformity and the persecution of Protestant dissenters.[CITATION-112] It argued that the recent fall of Tory ministers and subsequent ascendency of the \u2018moderates\u2019 was part of a co-ordinated plot to destroy the church and undermine the monarchical state.[CITATION-113] An annotated copy in the Wren Library provides a succinct precis: \u2018The design of it is to shew yythen Ministry were contriving ydestruction of yCh. of Eng& countenanc\u2019d it\u2019s gest enemies, & ythen all places & Prefermwere possess\u2019d by yWhigs\u2019.[CITATION-114] Thewas to be Edwards\u2019s last major commission; his business was caught in the crossfire generated by the pamphlet and, after six months on the run, he surrendered himself to the statesman Robert Harley, who then held the post of Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Harley had a long-standing interest in the workings of the press.[CITATION-115] While in custody, Edwards outlined to him precisely how he came to print and distribute the. The depositions provide a unique snapshot of the internal workings of an underground press.Edwards received the copy of theunder suitably mysterious circumstances. Following the famous \u2018communications circuit\u2019 model proposed by Robert Darnton, much recent scholarship has assumed that booksellers and publishers commissioned new writings, employing a freelance printer or printers to manufacture the books.[CITATION-116] However, the production of controversial pamphlets followed a different model. Some authors dealt directly with trusted printers, cutting out the middleman; in Edwards\u2019s case, such authors included the Tory satirists Ned Ward and William Pittis, who called him \u2018old Friend\u2019.[CITATION-117] Other authors took extra precautions to protect their identity, hiring an anonymous intermediary. To this end, the authors of theemployed a \u2018woman in a Vizard mask\u2019 to carry their manuscript to Edwards.[CITATION-118] When she spoke she held her Mask in her hand before her Face ... She told me I had people to deal with now that would stand by me, but she would not tell me the Author. She importuned me to do it, and said it would be the making of me. I read 5 or 6 Pages while she was by. She pressed to have ^\\it/ done in a fortnight, and desired my note to satisfy the Gentleman she brought it from, which I gave her; and she gave me an Indented Paper as a token for the Delivery of two Hundred & fifty Books, which I was to allow for the Copy.[CITATION-119] Edwards received no cash payment for printing the; indeed, he was to pay the authors with the 250 copies, which he later grumbled was \u2018Twelve pounds Six shillings out of my pocket\u2019.[CITATION-120] He could only turn a profit by selling a large number of additional copies. A ticket porter was later dispatched to take delivery of the 250 books with the corresponding half of the \u2018Indented Paper\u2019. This was another reasonable safeguard. Not only did the token ensure that Edwards would not surrender the books to the wrong man, it also enabled the authors to shield themselves by employing yet another anonymous agent to collect the books on their behalf. Once Edwards had finished printing the edition, the masked woman urged him to \u2018burn the Copy & break all\u2019, destroying the manuscript evidence.[CITATION-121] He did not heed the warning.Edwards printed \u2018about 1500\u2019 copies of thein total.[CITATION-122] He took the standard precautions he had learned during his apprenticeship under Braddyll. The title page bears no name and the imprint reads only \u2018: | Printed in the Year 1705\u2019. The paper is coarse and unwatermarked. For decoration on the title page he used a hexagonal arrangement of squatfleurons, probably inherited along with the rest of Nathaniel Thompson\u2019s equipment. He had deployed those fleurons on the title pages of other recent books. Two examples from 1703 include, a cryptic imitation of Virgil\u2019s fourth, and the satirical, which one of Harley\u2019s press spies attributed to Ned Ward.[CITATION-123] But, crucially, those books were all printed and published anonymously. Edwards never used these particular fleurons on books which bore his imprint; they were reserved for clandestine publications only.[CITATION-124] Unlike wooden ornaments and factotums, metal fleurons were mass-produced by the same method used for the production of type. This particular variety of fleuron can be traced back as far as 1660.[CITATION-125] In the same years Edwards was active, identical fleurons from the same punches were being used by Jeremiah Wilkins, Charles Bill and the music specialist John Heptinstall. Edwards must have known that ornaments could be investigated. Back in 1664, L\u2019Estrange had managed to trace a specific fleuron used for the printing of a libel to the press of Simon Dover.[CITATION-126] William Anderton was convicted and hanged partially on a superficial bibliographical analysis of the founts discovered in his possession.[CITATION-127] By using such a common fleuron for his deniable work, Edwards made it difficult for government henchmen to trace the books to his workshop.The printer also fiddled with the text. On the seventh and eighth pages of the manuscript, concerning quisling MPs who voted against the occasional conformity bills, Edwards blotted out several names and jotted in the margin, \u2018out wa Blank\u2019, rendering the passage: \u2018If [blank] were to beupon Oath, what wrought this wondrousin \u2019em? They wou\u2019d Answer, that the L\u2014 T\u2014 requir\u2019d it of \u2019em, and that theytheirby that\u2019.[CITATION-128] By removing those names, Edwards may have hoped to lessen the chances of a prosecution for criminal libel. He also \u2018alter\u2019d the manner of the Dashes from what they were in the Copy\u2019, for he thought the idiosyncratic patterning of dashes and \u2018the style and pointings\u2019 in the manuscript might be used to hunt down the author.[CITATION-129] He was equally diligent in correcting the proofs. In some of Edwards\u2019s previous work for Sir Humphrey Mackworth, proof sheets had been carried by an intermediary to Mackworth\u2019s home at Snow Hill, and, once corrected, delivered back to the printing house.[CITATION-130] We know this because Edwards secretly tailed the courier, a bookseller called George Strahan, after handing over the sheets at a tavern.[CITATION-131] One of Edwards\u2019s former apprentices explained how, on other occasions, \u2018a certain Lord & an other person\u2019 would visit \u2018to read & Correct ythings ysEdwds was printing\u2019.[CITATION-132] Proofs for thewere corrected in house. Without access to the author, Edwards employed an old friend called Hughes, who read the manuscript aloud while Edwards scanned the printed text. Usually a servant could perform this role. But in this instance he preferred to employ a trusted friend\u2014one who was not part of the book trade and who \u2018knew no more the Author of the Memorial, than the man in the moon\u2019.[CITATION-133] Edwards trusted Hughes to keep his mouth shut.Copies of thecould not be purchased directly from Edwards by the public. Once the 250 copies for the authors had been handed to the courier, \u2018the rest of the Impression was delivered to Brag, Nutt, Strahan\u2019.[CITATION-134] Strahan was a jobbing bookseller with whom Edwards worked closely; he was, in Edwards\u2019s words, \u2018a niggardly covetous fellow\u2019 from whom he had recently borrowed money, so he was given a hundred free copies to settle the debt.[CITATION-135] Anne Croome confessed to hawking fifty copies which she probably received from her husband, George.[CITATION-136] Benjamin Bragg and John Nutt were two of the major \u2018trade publishers\u2019 in London, to use a term coined by McKenzie and elucidated by Michael Treadwell.[CITATION-137] For a small mark-up, they would distribute pamphlets among the trade\u2019s \u2018underdealers\u2019 and deflect unwanted government attention.[CITATION-138] Nutt, in particular, was associated with the Tory interest.[CITATION-139] His successor, John Morphew, explained that it was \u2018a very usual thing for persons to leave books & papers at his House and at the Houses of other Publishers\u2019 without leaving their names, \u2018and if the Government makes enquiry concerning the Authors of any books or papers so left, in order to bring them to punishment, it often happens that nobody comes to make any demand for the value of the said Books\u2019.[CITATION-140] If similar tactics were used for the, the distributors would have known nothing of Edwards\u2019s involvement up front. Doubtless he did not find the chance to collect his profits from the distributors before being forced to abscond. If Edwards sought purely financial gain from printing this pamphlet, his plan was not a good one. But if he wanted to make a distinctive political intervention, he was on firmer territory.Of the first 250 copies, there is some evidence to suggest they were sent by the authors to Oxford, where they were circulated by the master of University College, Arthur Charlett, who sent multiple copies of theto friends in the provinces.[CITATION-141] An anonymous informant tipped Harley off that Charlett \u2018receiv\u2019d by the Carrier & dispers\u2019d thro\u2019 yuniversity great numbers of y\u2019.[CITATION-142] Another letter in the same hand addressed to Charlett and signed \u2018John White\u2019 accused him of distributing \u2018a great parcel\u2019 of copies, and offered him the chance \u2018voluntarily to inform yGovernment what you know of yAuthor or Authors\u2019.[CITATION-143] That same summer, Thomas Hearne recalled toasting \u2018the Health of the Author of the\u2019 with his Oxford colleagues. In August, the university leaders, bowing to government pressure, sponsored a sermon \u2018recommending union and Moderation, and not suffering our Zeal to carry us so far as to bespatter our Governours in libellous Pamphletts, such as he insinuated had lately appear\u2019d\u2019. Hearne understood which seditious pamphlet the preacher had in mind: \u2018without doubt that useful one the\u2019.[CITATION-144] The case of theshows Edwards adopting similar tactics to those employed by the radical Whig printer under whom he trained. Like his former master, Edwards worked within a complex network of authors, couriers and distributors. He simply had no need to rely on publishers or booksellers because, for clandestine jobs, he dealt directly with authors and their agents, who muddied the waters by preserving their anonymity. He distributed the books anonymously via trade publishers. He used indentures and tokens to ensure against imposters, and tweaked copy texts to mask distinctive stylistic tics. Many of the same covert techniques applied both to the production of controversial polemical tracts and to the pirated almanacs and primers which so deeply irritated the Stationers\u2019 Company. The primary difference was that, with the latter, Edwards needed only to protect himself and not an author.This article has, first, reconstructed the contexts in which Edwards learned the skills and techniques of underground printing; secondly, documented his prolific career as a printer of seditious Catholic and Jacobite books; and, thirdly, illuminated some of the techniques he used to mask his involvement in printing controversial tracts. We must now examine the final phase of Edwards\u2019s career: his recruitment and activities as a government asset.Furnished with an inside knowledge of the trade, printers often made excellent spies. Robert Stephens had initially trained as a stationer before accepting the role of messenger of the press under L\u2019Estrange.[CITATION-145] Gellibrand too had formerly printed and sold prohibited books. After brushes with the law in 1677 and 1685, in 1690 he offered to \u2018discover the Printer of a scandalous Libel\u2019 for the House of Lords and, on 20 February 1691, was assigned the post of messenger of the press, granting him authority to \u2018make diligent search in all printing houses, Booksellers and Bookebinders shops and Warehouses\u2019 in order to hunt down anybody \u2018found to print, stitch, cry and sell, or privately convey, or any way disperse such unlicenced, seditious, false, and scandalous Books\u2019.[CITATION-146] By the time thewas published, Gellibrand had officially been seconded to the customs office, though this role appears to have been little more than a smokescreen for his real activities intercepting illicit books.[CITATION-147] Robert Clare, whom Harley recruited in 1705 partly to hunt down Edwards, explained the particular skills which he, as a printer, brought to surveillance work: his years as a compositor had furnished him with an ability to \u2018read the Metal as well as the Print\u2019.[CITATION-148] In other words, he claimed he could decipher the text of pamphlets before they were even printed, while they were still slabs of uninked standing type on the compositor\u2019s workbench.But there were also disadvantages to recruiting from inside the book trade. Once a printer was exposed as a snitch, they could be shut out of the trade\u2019s inner workings; an informant without access was not of much help to the government. Thus, Clare\u2019s utility wore thin within a few months of his defection. The churchmen likewise viewed Edwards as a turncoat, as his missives to Harley elucidate:my Coming in to serve the Government, ha[s] Provok\u2019d a Restless Party that make it their Business to study my Ruine. They have set all the People I dealt with against me, insomuch; That if your Honour stands not favourably my Advocate, there\u2019s nothing but Ruine will Ensue, by reason they are so Numerous and Powerful, and put (as above) Defiance to all. My Landlord sent to me this very day to acquaint me, That he\u2019ll play no longer than Tuesday next, and that if I be not Ready for him then, he\u2019ll seize what I have, being told by some of \u2019em, That the Government will Turn me off with Nothing.[CITATION-149] Edwards thus had much to offer Harley and Harley much to offer Edwards. His pardon for printing thewas conditional on the quality of his information, and his financial security dependent on Harley\u2019s willingness to pay for it.[CITATION-150] But, equally, Harley\u2019s investigation into the pamphlet\u2019s authorship was doomed without the printer\u2019s contribution. Over the coming months, Edwards and his wife chased leads while Harley provided \u2018suitable Encouragement\u2019 in the form of secret service payments of between \u00a35 and \u00a315 a time, at fairly regular intervals.[CITATION-151] Once it became clear that Edwards could not gather enough evidence to charge the suspected authors, two of whom were sitting MPs, he lobbied Harley for more permanent employment. In January 1707, he was offered the role of printer to the customs house, a job currently filled by a customs official who, Edwards complained, \u2018has neither Knowledge, Right, nor Title to [the] Art and Mystery of Printing\u2019.[CITATION-152] And in July his name was floated as Stephens\u2019s replacement as messenger of the press:My Wife tells me you were pleased to offer the messenger of the Press\u2019s Place, which is but 40ll per Ann. If the sallary was now as when SRoger Le\u2019Estrange officiated in ysaid place, viz. one hundred pounds per Ann: I wou\u2019d Accept of it; tho\u2019 after this Blunder [i.e. Stephens], who was always look\u2019d upon as the scum of yTrade; with a Proviso, That if I shou\u2019d Survive MMary Jones, I may succeed in her Place in ySavoy.[CITATION-153] That Edwards believed himself in any position to bargain shows how far he was out of his depth. Edward Jones, who printed the official government newspaper, the, had died in the previous February, leaving his printing workshop at the Savoy and the lucrativecontract to his wife, Mary Jones, who was not long for this world. Her natural successor was John Nutt, who managed the Savoy press alongside his distribution business.[CITATION-154] In his above-board dealings, Edwards had experience printing newspapers and comment serials, including the short-lived(1701), the(1702), and William Pittis\u2019s amusing periodical(1703\u20134). But if the printer thought his experience and service had been valuable enough for the Secretary of State to intervene and reassign thecontract, he was deluding himself. He was never appointed to the role of messenger and did not succeed Mary Jones as printer of the. Harley was distracted by the more serious business of backstairs court intrigue and, before the year was done, by the crisis mounting from the treachery of one of his clerks, William Greg.[CITATION-155] Edwards continued quietly to work for the customs office.[CITATION-156] He and his wife would occasionally print literary and satirical works by old friends, such as Ned Ward\u2019sin 1710. But he no longer earned his living from libels.Collaborating with a government investigation did not constitute wholesale treachery. When Braddyll assisted L\u2019Estrange in his search for the authors ofhe did not renounce his Whig principles; Dunton could still praise Braddyll as \u2018religiously true to his word\u2019, while also mentioning that he \u2018was once a good Friend to Sir Roger L\u2019Estrange, when matters looked a little dark upon him\u2019.[CITATION-157] Even Merryweather, who wished \u2018rather to dye honourably than live basely\u2019, cracked in the end.[CITATION-158] Self-preservation was no sin, and Edwards had learned enough from Braddyll to know when the game was up. The printer did not turn his back on his principles. At no point did he offer information on his Jacobite contacts. He agreed only to root out the authors of the, specifically Sir Humphrey Mackworth and Henry Poley, neither of whom was a Jacobite and both of whom had abandoned Edwards in his hour of need. His willingness to take the position of messenger, for the right price, reflects only the potential for corruption in that role. Richard Kingston\u2019s investigation into the messenger service exposed a startling number of crooked agents: Benjamin Maris, whose \u2018Wife is a Papist, and communicates all she knowes to that Faction\u2019; Francis Clerke, who \u2018keepes company with the Jacobites and is much commended by all that party\u2019; William Jones, who \u2018receives gratuities from the Club at the Dog near the palace gate Westminster\u2019, where Edwards drank and met with his Jacobite \u2018brethren\u2019.[CITATION-159] Like those three messengers, Edwards may well have hoped to turn this position to his own nefarious ends.Much has been written about how the growth of the public sphere in post-revolutionary England was facilitated by access to political ideas through printed texts. Central to J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s influential thesis was \u2018the elimination of the institution of censorship\u2019 with the lapse of the Printing Act in 1695.[CITATION-160] Few historians remain so na\u00efve as to think the end of licensing ushered in a new era of free expression; the legislation was allowed to lapse only because common law provided a more effective means to suppress seditious texts.[CITATION-161] Admittedly, the end of licensing did open up new opportunities for the periodical press and for printing beyond the traditional urban and academic centres of London, Oxford and Cambridge.[CITATION-162] And there is general agreement that increased access to print in coffeehouses, taverns and on the street did much to foster public engagement in political debate.[CITATION-163] But the career of David Edwards provides a salutary reminder that this climate of political engagement and partisan controversy was built not on the sudden emergence of a free press, nor even solely on an expanded market for periodical journalism, but rather on the continuing secretive labours of a literary underground.[CITATION-164] Mastery of the techniques of covert printing allowed a relatively small operation like Edwards\u2019s press on Nevil\u2019s Alley to exert a disproportionate influence on political debate. Almost without exception, the most provocative and disputed books from any particular year were products of the underground press, whether those were famous examples by Toland or Tindal or Defoe or Swift, or neglected polemics from Edwards\u2019s workshop such as theor. These pamphlets would be read alongside and in dialogue with conventionally printed books and newspapers. Illicit books provided ammunition for the licit press, the vibrancy of which owed much to fact that it could both draw on and argue against controversial texts emanating from the literary underground.Coffeehouse patrons were daily exposed to all manner of clandestine publications, ranging from the handwritten newsletters of John Dyer to the latest printed pamphlets and journals.[CITATION-165] Readers characterised libellous books by the surreptitious manner of their printing. Thus, when Hugh Chamberlen attacked an anonymous pamphlet in 1696, he observed that the \u2018Author designed it a Libel, as it appears by the manner of its coming Abroad, having been plentifully dispersed in Town and Country, without either the Authors or the Printers Name\u2019.[CITATION-166] Even the Whig controversialist John Tutchin complained about the \u2018vast numbers of Papers Issued from the Press Weekly, most of \u2019em Convicted of being Libels in the very Frontispiece, or Title Page, without either Author Printer or Publishers Name to \u2019em\u2019.[CITATION-167] Of the roughly eighty books targeted by government officials as seditious libels during the two decades following the lapse of the Printing Act, more than half have minimal information in the imprint: sometimes the city and year of publication, but not always, and occasionally the noncommittal tag \u2018to be sold by the Booksellers ofand\u2019.[CITATION-168] Sixteen imprints contain the names of trade publishers, who neither printed the books nor had any financial stake in their production nor knew the identity of the authors, and a smattering have demonstrably false imprints, for instance attributing books to the phantom publisher \u2018A. Moore\u2019.[CITATION-169] Beyond books which were singled out for legal censure, it is important to recognise that a massive proportion of all potentially controversial pamphlets and newspapers were printed with such false, deniable or vague imprints. Their broad distribution, combined with their mysterious authorship and origins, made them a fixture of coffeehouse gossip. Readers would debate whatever scanty information was provided on title pages and comb through texts for distinctive identifying quirks.[CITATION-170] This link between clandestine printing, anonymous authorship and the putative public sphere is yet to be fully explored by historians, bibliographers or literary scholars. For in the revisionist and post-revisionist battles of early modern historiography, \u2018manuscript\u2019 and \u2018print\u2019 have usually been conceptualised as uniform but discrete categories: one private, the other public.[CITATION-171] Although recent scholarship by Noah Millstone and others has usefully grappled with the tension between manuscript circulation and public politics, historians continue to discuss print in the later Stuart era as an intrinsically public form.[CITATION-172] And yet the tension between texts which were written and printed in secret, but consumed and read and debated in public, lies at the heart of later Stuart political culture. It was the confidentiality of Edwards\u2019s operation that allowed the results of his press to have such extensive public impact. Because of the difficulty of tracing pamphlets like theback to Edwards\u2019s workshop, they could be distributed outside Parliament, on the streets, and in bookshops, coffeehouses and taverns. With scholars such as Mark Knights constructing new models of a later Stuart public sphere, one which,Habermas, was neither bourgeois nor polite nor rational, and which was fuelled by malicious gossip, libel, propaganda and \u2018false news\u2019, it becomes even more crucial to understand how this public culture was sustained and manipulated by the underground press.[CITATION-173] Printers played a key role in mobilising this politically engaged public by issuing propaganda in anonymous formats. Pamphlets and periodicals were often designed to jolt individual readers into action: to encourage MPs to legislate one way or another, or to sway enfranchised voters towards particular parliamentary candidates, or to embolden readers to participate in mass demonstrations on the streets.[CITATION-174] This form of agitprop required anonymity not merely for the authors to avoid prosecution; it needed to be anonymous in order to be effective. By advertising their identities, authors enabled their opponents to respond with personal invective or attribute spurious motives to their original polemical interventions. It was altogether easier for an anonymous pamphlet to be situated in a broader political campaign. And some specific forms of black propaganda, such as Defoe\u2019s(1702), relied entirely on the mechanics of underground printing for their efficacy, disguising the true source of the text to grant it the appearance of a genuine high church screed veering into Jacobite sedition.[CITATION-175] Like the authors of the, Defoe employed a press agent to carry the anonymous manuscript ofto the printer George Croome, a Nonjuror whom some \u2018would insinuate as though he favoured the Jacobites\u2019.[CITATION-176] Misled by Defoe\u2019s expert impersonation, Croome printed and sold the books in good faith. Only by publishing anonymously and shielding his true identity from his printer could Defoe ensure that the argument would be taken seriously, and therefore that both Parliament and his fellow partisans would mobilisehis book.[CITATION-177] Underground printing was fundamentally entwined with his polemical strategy.Vicious forms of libel, polemic and propaganda were central to the later Stuart public sphere. Partisan writers were emboldened to experiment with those forms not solely by the end of pre-publication licensing in 1695, but rather by the persistence of the underground press. It was in secretly printed pamphlets that writers took their greatest liberties. The government treated the underground press seriously and printers understood the danger posed by government agents; they devised new strategies and adapted old ones to combat the threat of surveillance. Without access to the anonymising services provided by Edwards and other printers of his sort, more pamphleteers and polemicists would have been made accountable for their words.
