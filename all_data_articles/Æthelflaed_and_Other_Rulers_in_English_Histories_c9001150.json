It argues that these writers evaluated and compared rulers based not on sex or bloodline, but on the quality of a ruler\u2019s achievements relative to the set and scale of challenges the ruler faced. They thought \u00c6thelflaed remarkable because her triumphs for Mercia distinguished her from other rulers. The article shows that a new understanding of attitudes in twelfth-century England towards rulers, past and present, is required. It accounts for the absence of gendered comments about rulers, as well as the presence of non-binary concepts of gender, in medieval writing. It also challenges the enduring idea that Latin writers imposed a shared, Wessex-dominated national vision on the English past. They asserted Mercia\u2019s independence under \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s sole rule, which shows that English regional interests persisted in the historical imagination long after the Norman Conquest.In early twelfth-century England, when the Empress Matilda and Stephen of Blois vied for the throne, writers of history deemed \u00c6thelflaed of Mercia (d. 918) among the greatest rulers of the past. For writers well-acquainted with ancient emperors and English kings, this was a remarkable historical verdict. Before the English kingdom formed, \u00c6thelflaed ruled Mercia, a kingdom later conquered by her brother, Edward the Elder of Wessex, and absorbed into his territory. Her legacy was not the legacy of a ruler whose realm and issue long outlived her. Yet for Henry of Huntingdon, writing in the heart of the former kingdom of Mercia, she was greater than Caesar, and by a larger measure than William the Conqueror was.Until now, readers have assumed that factors outside \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s control explained her impact on twelfth-century thinking. She was female, so the prospect of Empress Matilda\u2019s rule of England must have awakened historical interest in \u00c6thelflaed. She was King Alfred\u2019s daughter, so writers of English history must have perceived her rule in Mercia as an arm of the far-reaching House of Wessex, a royal family about to effect the forming of a single English kingdom. These factors lack explanatory power. What mattered was what she did.The aim of this article is to explain why \u00c6thelflaed, ruler of Mercia, mattered to writers of history in twelfth-century England. To do so, it establishes the grounds on which they thought her a peerless leader. It argues that they evaluated and compared rulers based not on sex or bloodline, but on the quality of a ruler\u2019s achievements relative to the set and scale of challenges the ruler faced. They thought \u00c6thelflaed remarkable because her triumphs for Mercia distinguished her from other rulers.The article will show that a new understanding of attitudes in twelfth-century England towards rulers, past and present, is required. This understanding needs to account for the absence of gendered comments about rulers, as well as the presence of non-binary concepts of gender. It will suggest, too, that regional interests persisted in the historical record not only before and during,[CITATION-1] but also long after, the Norman Conquest. These writers\u2019 shared assertion of Mercia\u2019s independence under \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s sole rule brings under scrutiny the enduring idea that Latin writers imposed a shared, Wessex-dominated, national vision on the English past. They did not look at \u00c6thelflaed and see a female ruler. They saw things from her perspective\u2014as a ruler, looking at what was at stake for the Mercian kingdom at the turn of the tenth century.A brief introduction to these writers, and to the current understanding of their views of \u00c6thelflaed, will be useful here. William of Malmesbury, the erudite, inquisitive Benedictine monk, completed his(1125, revised by 1127) after Henry I\u2019s male heir William Adelin drowned in the White Ship disaster of 1120. A witness to councils\u2019 negotiations about the conflict between Matilda and Stephen, he also wrote(early 1140s) about recent history. The monk John of Worcester directed the team-written(completed by 1141, extended by the Gloucester continuator through 1143). Henry of Huntingdon, a secular cleric, wrote and revised his(during 1129\u20131154); the Cistercian monk Aelred of Rievaulx, writing in Northumbria, elaborated on Henry\u2019s work in his mid-twelfth-century.[CITATION-2] William and Henry wrote discursive histories, Aelred framed his historical narrative as a genealogy, and John translated and adapted Anglo-Saxon Chronicle annals from Old English into Latin. The mid-twelfth-century, written exclusively about current events, provides an essential perspective on the language and stakes of contemporary rulership.It may be surprising that the question of \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s significance to these writers as a ruler has never been asked. In presuming the primacy of gender, existing analytical categories preclude asking whether gender mattered to their thinking about good rulership, and, if so, how. In studies of women, queenship, and kingship alike, the real comparisons that medieval writers made between rulers across (or without reference to) sex and gender are ignored. It is therefore imperative to investigate \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s true importance in their comparative historical thinking.\u00c6thelflaed and her legacy in twelfth-century England have been treated only in enquiries into gender[CITATION-3] or queenship,[CITATION-4] even though she was not a queen. It has long been accepted that Anglo-Norman writers saw \u00c6thelflaed as prefiguring Matilda because the two rulers were women.[CITATION-5] On the other hand, scholarship on twelfth-century ideas in England about rulership tends to concentrate exclusively on kings, not rulers, thus overlooking \u00c6thelflaed.[CITATION-6] Aelred\u2019s praise for \u00c6thelflaed has been discussed in relation to his views of women (read as either negative[CITATION-7] or positive[CITATION-8] ), not his views of rulers.[CITATION-9] It has been argued, too, that female patronage shows that \u2018gender was decisive\u2019 in influencing chronicles\u2019 structure and content.[CITATION-10] But is this how contemporaries thought? To ask how twelfth-century writers viewed \u00c6thelflaed as a \u2018female ruler\u2019 embeds an assumption: that they perceived being female as the defining element of her rulership.To establish why these twelfth-century writers considered \u00c6thelflaed an outstanding ruler, this article takes rulership, not gender, as the primary framework: where command is the constant, how did writers think about the variable qualities of different leaders? This requires a three-part approach. First, because the \u2018female ruler\u2019 framing has thrown \u00c6thelflaed and Matilda together as self-evident comparanda, we must discover whether gender (and gendered language) had any bearing on the titles twelfth-century writers assigned to rulers; and we must determine on what grounds writers discussed views of the rulership of Matilda and her contemporaries. This first section will show that, where gendered language appeared, it was applied to both men and women, and used exclusively along political lines (favourably for allies and as an insult to enemies). It will argue that Stephen and Matilda\u2019s disputed claim to the English throne was discussed on the basis of their right to rule, and in terms of the quality of each as a ruler. The dispute was not interpreted in gendered terms. There is no evidence that Matilda was evaluated as a \u2018female ruler\u2019 and compared to \u00c6thelflaed for that reason.Because kingship studies have omitted \u00c6thelflaed, the second section examines writers\u2019 views of \u00c6thelflaed and other rulers to whom they implicitly and explicitly compared her. This part will consider the significance of the different but overlapping sets of evidence for past rulers used by each writer. It will argue that they compared \u00c6thelflaed to other rulers on the basis of shared or similar challenges and achievements, without regard to gender. \u00c6thelflaed they judged superior because she was personally successful as an autonomous ruler.The third, concluding section shows why the findings of sections I and II matter for our understanding of these writers\u2019 thinking about English histories. This part will argue that these twelfth-century writers regarded Mercia\u2019s past as contested, that siblings might both co-operate and compete as rulers of different entities, and that conquest could not quell memories of resistance, strong lordship and independence. Twelfth-century writers could see, as they imagined the world from a tenth-century vantage point, that the former English kingdoms could well have had very different futures.In translating Latin, a language which has grammatical gender, into English, which does not, there is a risk of conflating grammatical gender with gendered language. Grammatical gender is a classification of word-forms, whereas gendered language ascribes a gendered quality of meaning to its subject.andwe translate as \u2018conqueror\u2019: the person, man or woman, engages in the same activity, conquering. Yetis generally translated \u2018lord\u2019 and\u2018lady\u2019, which can imply a consort-like role: it neither conveys the activity of ruling, nor invites comparison with other rulers, as readily as \u2018lord\u2019. In Latin, the fact of being male or female requires the masculine or feminine form of the word. This categorical demand disambiguates male and female conquerors. It gives no information about a qualitative difference in meaning between men and women conquering, or being lords. Because the language requires a gendered ending, the word form on its own cannot tell us anything about the author\u2019s intention to ascribe a masculine or feminine quality to conquering.Narrative and historical context illuminates medieval use, allowing us to determine whether emphasis lies on an activity, or a gendered characterisation of that activity.is an example of gendered language: the object is to characterise behaviour as \u2018manly\u2019.and, though respectively terms for a man and a woman, carry no connotation of behaving in a \u2018manly\u2019 or \u2018womanly\u2019 manner. Medieval writers commonly usedto mean \u2018ruler\u2019 or \u2018lord\u2019: a person who exercised real and recognised authority over others. Domesday Book shows that both men and women held and managed lands as independent lords ().[CITATION-11] As ruler of Mercia, \u00c6thelflaed issued charters as[CITATION-12] and;[CITATION-13] the Mercian Anglo-Saxon Chronicle annals, discussed below, used, the Old English equivalent of(lord).In the twelfth century, terms for rulers posed the challenges of distinguishing one ruler from others and signalling independent rule. Bothandwere potentially ambiguous. Twelfth-century English rulers could hold both regal and lordly titles, or usefor.[CITATION-14] Manyruled in twelfth-century Wales and Ireland, wheredid not connote the same wide-ranging overlordship as in England and Scotland.[CITATION-15] Owain Gwynedd famously styled himselfof Wales after the Roman imperial title, rather than, which angered Henry II because it appeared to claim lordship over multiple kingdoms of Wales, rather than Gwynedd alone.[CITATION-16] The existence of people with the same royal title\u2014and especially the same name\u2014was likely to cause confusion. After Henry the Young King was crowned king of England () in 1170 while his father Henry II held the throne and the same title, contemporaries had to resort to(\u2018son-king\u2019) or(\u2018young king\u2019) for the former and(\u2018father-king\u2019) for the latter.[CITATION-17] In medieval Europemost often denoted consort, a role which became more formally recognised over time, but signified no independent political influence.[CITATION-18] In Wales and Ireland, \u00c6thelflaed was known as \u2018queen\u2019, a term with no special connection to authority.[CITATION-19] The Annals of Ulster showed her rulership through her story rather than her title: she responded to calls for aid, acted as an overlord, and possessed an excellent reputation as \u2018most famed queen of the Saxons\u2019 (); the Annals marked her death (but not those of the West Saxon kings Alfred and Edward) as though invoking a regnal year.[CITATION-20] The author ofusedin multiple senses: for Empress Matilda\u2019s brief rise to power during Stephen\u2019s captivity, for Stephen\u2019s wife Queen Matilda as regent and as king\u2019s wife, and for London, \u2018queen and capital of the whole kingdom\u2019 ().[CITATION-21] The terms(lord of England) and(lord of the English) have been interpreted as meaning authority exercised prior to an anticipated coronation. George Garnett has suggested that Richard I\u2019s clerks styled himafter Henry II\u2019s death in 1189 in order to assert Richard\u2019s \u2018royal jurisdiction\u2019 before his coronation, and that this may have inspired King John to be variously styled,andin 1199 prior to his.[CITATION-22] Stephen Church has shown that the termhas a longer history of use in this sense: for John as lord of Ireland in 1185, and\u2014as\u2014Empress Matilda as lord of England in 1141.[CITATION-23] This concept thus occurs first in the grammatical feminine form. That same form could be ambiguous: Henry I\u2019s second wife, Adeliza, was known asbefore her coronation as queen consort in 1121,[CITATION-24] but a consort was not an independent lord.The disambiguation problem extended to what rulers ruled. When Stephen was captured in February 1141, he could not freely exert lordship, but was still the crowned king of England ().[CITATION-25] After negotiations between the Empress and Henry of Blois, Matilda was namedat the Council of Winchester in April.[CITATION-26] Karl Schnith observed in 1976 a key nuance of these negotiations: Henry of Blois\u2019s party preferredfor Matilda because it reflected her status as Henry I\u2019s heir and echoed Adeliza\u2019s pre-coronation consort title.[CITATION-27] Matilda herself may have preferred, as her seals style her.[CITATION-28] had no specific legal status in 1141;[CITATION-29] paired with, it disambiguated Matilda from the queen consorts Matilda of Scotland (her mother) and Matilda of Boulogne (Stephen\u2019s wife), as well as Adeliza. Stephen might yet rule the realm of England, but the Empress ruled the English people. The author of, silent about the council (and perhaps her preference), called her, butunmodified.[CITATION-30] Ambiguity prompted creative solutions. Where writers asserted lordship, past and present, clarity was more important than consistency. Matilda\u2019s charters used bothvariants;[CITATION-31] she was called, and styledon three different coins that follow the design of William I\u2019s.[CITATION-32] To distinguish the roles of different Matildas, the Gloucester continuator styled Stephen\u2019s wifeand Matilda(\u2018lord empress\u2019).[CITATION-33] With different strategies and titles, her advocates sought to mark her out as a commander.The problem for contemporaries was not one of gender, but of signalling rulership where it was not obvious. In the twelfth century this problem was shared by the uncrowned rulers Matilda, Richard and John, and by the concurrent rulers Henry II and Henry the Young King. For \u00c6thelflaed, wherewas the obvious Latin translation of, no Anglo-Norman writer usedalone, because it was not precise enough to signal a person who ruled. John of Worcester (directly translating the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle) used; Henry of Huntingdon used,[CITATION-34] ,, and, to show that she wielded power and conquered in her own person, not as heir or consort. That \u00c6thelflaed and Matilda were women is not sufficient reason to decide that Henry\u2019s termfor \u00c6thelflaed (often cited apart from his other appellations for her) was a coy reference to Matilda.[CITATION-35] Context and modifiers, not isolated words or gendered endings, made meaning.If grammatical gender did not mean ruling \u2018as a woman\u2019, did contemporaries deploy gender in their arguments about good, and legitimate, rulership? The author ofcriticised behaviour with gendered language, doing so in a partisan way. He did not extend this language to the legitimacy of rulers\u2019 claims or contemporaries\u2019 recognition of their lordship. Stephen, though often compared to the corrupted king Saul,[CITATION-36] was \u2018manly\u2019 (),[CITATION-37] and his wife Queen Matilda a \u2018manlike woman\u2019 () for leading others in battle and in sentiment.[CITATION-38] In the early medieval works of Gregory of Tours and Bede, queens consort won victories by begging their military husbands to show compassion and piety.[CITATION-39] In, the Queen won compassion from the enemy with tears,[CITATION-40] the king was \u2018always full of compassion\u2019 (),[CITATION-41] Stephen\u2019s men were compassionate,[CITATION-42] and Stephen moved his captors to genuine, tearful compassion for him.[CITATION-43] Those not \u2018moved\u2019 () by compassion were barbarous mercenaries; they\u2014and the Empress\u2014lacked the(\u2018deepest feelings of mercy\u2019) exhorted by Gregory the Great.[CITATION-44] On Stephen\u2019s side, both men and women had innate virtues of strength, mercy, and tears.By contrast, the Empress\u2019s advocates inwere unmanly and she unwomanly, revelling in being called queen. This latter claim is often cited out of context.[CITATION-45] In the same sentence the author states that many of Stephen\u2019s followers switched their allegiance to Matilda (some because of fortune; others with free will), and that Matilda made herself \u2018queen of all England\u2019 (). Despite his scorn for Stephen\u2019s enemies, the author affirmed that Matilda became, and was recognised as, a lord of men and ruler of England. Where partisan concerns were not involved, gendered language vanished:attributed initiative and agency to Eleanor (duchess of Aquitaine in her own right, and previously married to Louis VII of France) in claiming that she chose Henry II of England as her husband.[CITATION-46] A woman could be, and was, a powerful leader, whether the author described her behaviour in gendered language (the Queen and the Empress) or not (Eleanor).For Henry of Huntingdon, Matilda\u2019s behaviour was not characteristically gendered. On one occasion, he described Matilda\u2019s conduct in gendered language: she put the imprisoned king in chains, \u2018incited to a woman\u2019s brief vexation\u2019 ().[CITATION-47] On another, he wrote that Matilda was lifted () to \u2018lofty pride\u2019 () \u2018because\u2019 () the chances of war had brought prosperity to her supporters.was the familiar fault of a ruler who trusted unwisely in fortune, not God, as with the German emperor and the French king in Henry\u2019s account of 1148.[CITATION-48] For Henry, this fault was not, as the later writer William of Newburgh rewrote the passage, one of \u2018womanly arrogance\u2019 ().[CITATION-49] Imagining Matilda as a prospective and unprecedented female ruler,[CITATION-50] twentieth-century historians conjectured that Matilda\u2019s gender was the main reason for scepticism towards her claim in England[CITATION-51] \u2014no one wanted \u2018a woman\u2019 to rule[CITATION-52] \u2014but, as Jean Truax demonstrated, there is no evidence that contemporary writers and political actors held this view.[CITATION-53] No one made that argument. There was no principle by which it was a valid or viable argument to make. As Marjorie Chibnall observed, \u2018What mattered was the practical ability to seize power and secure formal recognition with coronation and unction\u2019.[CITATION-54] The practical matters discussed by contemporaries were wealth, presence, and foreign relations; the matters of principle were right, legitimate birth, and oaths.A ruler\u2019s presence and response time were explicit concerns during contested rule. The author ofclaimed that nobles preferred Stephen because of his wealth (he, like Henry I, seized the treasury at Winchester), generosity, high birth, and presence in a threatened kingdom. The latter, held the author, was decisive: he argued that Stephen was crowned because of his rapid arrival, his brother Bishop Henry\u2019s support, and frequent meetings with his followers.[CITATION-55] In John\u2019s, rulers almost always hasten.[CITATION-56] Other writers, looking back on periods of disputed rule, showed rulers lamenting that they could not be in multiple places at once.[CITATION-57] Matilda\u2019s delay in coming to England raised questions about her management and her material ability to support English nobles, many of whom had interests and property in Normandy.[CITATION-58] Foreign marriage offered the promise of alliance and the spectre of foreign influence. William of Malmesbury, a Matilda supporter, acknowledged the latter risk candidly in his. If Matilda became ruler of England, some thought her husband, Count Geoffrey of Anjou, might wield real power.[CITATION-59] This concern might seem rooted in an assumption that the male would dominate.[CITATION-60] According to William, however, the problem was that a ruler, in this case Henry I, had acted independently of his advisors. Roger of Salisbury resented that no one was consulted about the arranged marriage,[CITATION-61] an implicit criticism not of Matilda but of her father. William and Henry perceived the same risk\u2014foreign marriage and a spouse who might prove a dominant influence\u2014in the marriage of \u00c6thelred II (\u2018the Unready\u2019) to Emma of Normandy in 1002. They thought this foreign dominance was catastrophically realised with the Norman Conquest in 1066, because William I claimed the English throne through kinship with Emma.[CITATION-62] A woman could and did inherit in the absence of male heirs[CITATION-63] and was, in some cases, preferred to a male child. As Sara McDougall has shown, the persistent assumption that legitimacy mattered decisively by this point in the twelfth century is based on anachronistic readings of canon law and insufficient attention to real elite practice. Her finding is important to the present enquiry, because it means that we can discard the idea that Henry I\u2019s son Robert of Gloucester would have been chosen to succeed because he was male, if only he were legitimate. In a letter for the Empress about, William wrote that no one else he wrote about in that book\u2014\u2018neither any king nor any queen\u2019 ()\u2014had a more regal, more splendid hereditary right to rule the kingdom of the English than Matilda.[CITATION-64] The idea of Matilda\u2019s distinction was meant to flatter his new patron. What is important is that he distinguished her, not among women or queens, but among all royalty in history.In shaping a ruler\u2019s inheritance choices at this time, more important than a child\u2019s legitimacy was the status of the mother\u2019s family, both her ancestors and her living relatives.[CITATION-65] In Matilda\u2019s case it was also more important than gender. Henry I chose Matilda not because Robert of Gloucester was illegitimate, but because Matilda\u2019s mother, Matilda of Scotland, was a crowned queen of English and Scottish royal blood and her family had powerful royal allies in Britain and Europe. Empress Matilda herself was \u2018born to the purple\u2019: to a crowned king and a crowned queen, as her father had been;[CITATION-66] and, by the time of her designation as heir in 1126, she was a wealthy European lord in her own right. After her brother\u2019s death, Matilda was not a reluctantly selected substitute for the (unfortunately illegitimate) male, Robert of Gloucester. She was Henry\u2019s first choice as heir for dynastic and pragmatic reasons.The papal court of 1139 heard Stephen and Matilda\u2019s claims on the basis of right (): the parties debated the validity of oaths and legitimate birth. Although Matilda\u2019s legitimacy was raised, through the old question of whether her parents\u2019 marriage was valid if her mother had been veiled as a nun,[CITATION-67] the issue of legitimacy had negligible force in the discussion.[CITATION-68] In the 1160s, John of Salisbury framed the pope\u2019s reconfirmation of Stephen\u2019s kingship as an acceptance of Stephen\u2019s gift, implying that it was the king\u2019s persuasive wealth that had won papal support.[CITATION-69] Contemporaries discussed oaths in terms of compulsion and integrity. William, for example, judged Harold II and Stephen too cavalier with oaths and thought the people suffered as a result.[CITATION-70] According to some, the terms of the oath to Matilda were exacting, unconditional, and \u2018extracted\u2019 () by Henry I.[CITATION-71] Others argued that her inheritance, and the oath affirming it, were valid and binding. William, an eyewitness at the papal court, related the argument of the Empress\u2019s supporters: she should rule because she was Henry I\u2019s daughter and all England and Normandy were \u2018sworn\u2019 () to her.[CITATION-72] Henry of Huntingdon lamented the breaking of the oath; John claimed the \u2018bonds of peace\u2019 () were corrupted with Stephen\u2019s accession.[CITATION-73] None ascribed the oaths to fears about a woman being accepted as lord. William observed that Matilda held many continental possessions, and Lombard and Lotharingian princes petitioned repeatedly for her to be their lord.[CITATION-74] Henry I required the oath sworn to Matilda to be repeated, and repetition was not unusual: charters were reissued and reconfirmed, homage performed again. Rulers were normally anxious to ensure their heirs\u2019 succession. Edward the Confessor tried multiple times to bring a family heir into the orbit of his court;[CITATION-75] the still-hale Henry II had his eldest son pre-emptively crowned king. Even according to the author of, the contemporary writer most critical of Matilda\u2019s behaviour,[CITATION-76] English nobles argued the case for crowning Stephen in 1126 based on the oath\u2019s validity.[CITATION-77] Justice and right were the sinews of argument, and the nobles wanted the ruler who would best support their interests.In twelfth-century England, terms for rulers and discussions of rightful rule were not framed in gendered language. We turn now to what writers wrote of rulers more removed from their present: their views of \u00c6thelflaed and other rulers. The significance of their narratives depends on their interpretations of their sources, so a brief introduction to these is warranted.What we know of \u00c6thelflaed is that she was the daughter of King Alfred of Wessex and Ealhswith (of Mercian descent). She married \u00c6thelred, lord of the Mercians, probably in the 880s when Alfred forged an alliance with Mercia to defend against Scandinavian incursions. She acted as regent during her husband\u2019s illness, and the Mercians chose her as their ruler upon his death in 911.[CITATION-78] Asshe founded towns and churches, led armies, and built alliances.To twelfth-century writers, the decade of the 910s would have seemed a turning point in Anglo-Saxon history. Scandinavian invasions on two fronts beset the allied forces of Wessex and Mercia: the Danes in the Midlands, and the Norse who sailed from Ireland and established a kingdom in York. By the decade\u2019s end, Scandinavian rule in Northumbria had become client rulership. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (ASC) recorded that the Scandinavian forces were defeated, that Edward the Elder reigned over a newly combined realm as king from 919, and that his son \u00c6thelstan succeeded in 924.[CITATION-79] Contemporary accounts gave varied prominence to the leaders of Wessex and Mercia, and in particular to questions of overlordship and independent rule in Mercia.The Mercian Register (or \u2018Annals of \u00c6thelflaed\u2019, both terms coined by Charles Plummer for a Mercian-oriented part of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle) spans the years numbered 902 to 926. It covers in most detail the period from 909 to 919 and, as Pauline Stafford has noted, has the longest, most sustained discussion of women in the Chronicle.[CITATION-80] Stafford argues that these annals were conceived of in Mercia, very probably at the Mercian court of Worcester, in the early tenth century, as a continuation of the Alfredian Chronicle written in Wessex.[CITATION-81] The Mercian Register survives in three ASC manuscripts (B, C and D). Mercia had resisted overlordship, including that of Oswiu of Northumbria in the seventh century and Egbert of Wessex in the ninth; and there is evidence that the Mercian Register was actively suppressed in tenth-century Wessex.[CITATION-82] In this Mercian chronicle, \u00c6thelflaed built and restored strategic border fortresses on both fronts, won allies and offered support in the north.[CITATION-83] By 918, Danish forces in Leicester had submitted to \u00c6thelflaed,[CITATION-84] and she won York\u2019s submission shortly before her death at Tamworth in 918. Edward the Elder, otherwise almost entirely absent from these annals, seized Mercia from \u00c6lfwynn, \u00c6thelflaed and \u00c6thelred\u2019s daughter, in 919.[CITATION-85] Stafford has observed that these annals extend beyond \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s death, which could indicate that the motive for writing or continuing this narrative was to contend that \u00c6lfwynn had been wrongly deprived and to assert her legitimacy.[CITATION-86] The annals may have seemed to harbour, beyond the deeds of one great ruler, an ember of an argument for Mercian resistance.The West Saxon annals tell a different story. The earliest extant version, surviving in ASC MS A, shows the commanding figure of Edward the Elder leading the allied armies of Mercia and Wessex, capturing the Danish border towns of Hertford, Bedford and Buckingham in 912, 914 and 915.[CITATION-87] The A annals and Ealdorman \u00c6thelweard\u2019s chronicle refer to \u00c6thelflaed only as \u2018the king\u2019s sister\u2019 on her death, and only the A annals refer to her rule of Mercia\u2014in the past tense.[CITATION-88] Wessex had no comparable cases of political power wielded by women. Asser credited Alfred\u2019s mother with inspiring his education,[CITATION-89] but claimed that Offa of Mercia\u2019s daughter Eadburh may have poisoned her husband King Beorhtric of Wessex, and that thenceforth the king\u2019s wife would not be called queen.[CITATION-90] Before the mid-tenth century, a consort in Wessex was the \u2018king\u2019s wife\u2019, with limited influence; consorts in Mercia wielded more power, for instance by witnessing charters.[CITATION-91] In the twelfth century, the history of early tenth-century Anglo-Saxon kingdoms depended upon one\u2019s information and vantage point. Perhaps in response, the ASC D scribes in the eleventh and twelfth centuries rewrote earlier annals, bringing together histories of these different Anglo-Saxon kingdoms\u2014and they preserved stories of English and Scottish \u2018survivors\u2019 of the Norman Conquest in 1066, as well as its Norman victors.[CITATION-92] William, John, Henry and Aelred all knew the Mercian Register\u2019s version of early tenth-century events. William and John knew both Mercian and West Saxon versions; Henry knew only the Mercian version; and Aelred knew Henry\u2019s. For these Latin writers, the Mercian vision of history was worth remembering\u2014and more: it was historically significant.The circumstances of a ruler\u2019s birth\u2014whether foreign origin, ignoble birth, or being born female\u2014mattered less to these historians than what a ruler made of those circumstances and how he or she ruled. The clearest statement of this philosophy is found in William\u2019s account of King \u00c6thelstan in his. Addressing \u00c6thelstan directly, he stated:Adeo prestat ex te quam ex maioribus habere quo polleas, quia illud tuum, istud reputabitur alienum.[CITATION-93] It is far more outstanding that you should excel through that which comes from you, rather than from your ancestors, because the former will be considered yours; the latter, another\u2019s.William sustained this view in. He had a personal reason to admire \u00c6thelstan\u2019s deeds: the king, he reported proudly, gave pieces of the Cross to Malmesbury Abbey that actively sustained the abbey.[CITATION-94] He surpassed \u2018all his predecessors\u2019 () \u2018in spiritual devotion\u2019 () and his victories obscured theirs in splendour.[CITATION-95] His policies worked: he defeated treachery and exacted effective tribute payment from the Danes\u2014and for all this, he merited a celebratory ode.[CITATION-96] William noted the rumour that \u00c6thelstan was a concubine\u2019s son, and that it was used to dispute the king\u2019s legitimacy. William doubted its truth, and more importantly, its relevance. \u00c6thelstan, he observed, \u2018[had] nothing ignoble about him\u2019 ().[CITATION-97] That William I was born out of wedlock was equally irrelevant: William of Malmesbury stressed the enduring love between Duke Robert and Herleva, and Herleva\u2019s dream of her son\u2019s \u2018future greatness\u2019 ().[CITATION-98] \u00c6thelstan was remarkable for making himself sole ruler of England\u2014and a surpassingly impressive one\u2014neither because nor in spite of his birth. He achieved independent rule through action, sustaining hope and retaining loyalty: \u2018\u00c6thelstan, lest he disappoint the people\u2019s hope and diminish their esteem of him, subjugated all England entirely to the terror of his name alone\u2019 ().[CITATION-99] This was not pre-determined: it happened because of a forward-thinking ruler. William reiterated the importance of others\u2019 regard in explaining that \u00c6thelstan came to rule Northumbria\u2014the final kingdom to fall under his sway\u2014by the \u2018coincid[ing] of ancient right and new relationship\u2019 ()\u2014that is, the marriage alliance between \u00c6thelstan\u2019s sister and Sihtric, ruler of the Northumbrians.[CITATION-100] Northumbria was but the capstone of \u00c6thelstan\u2019s larger strategy of fulfilling the obligations of relationships with his citizens, neighbours and successors. According to William, he achieved rule of all England by this strategy. Precedent helped, but was not sufficient to make him king; and, ultimately, William deemed it less important. This is significant, because it means that William was highly sceptical of two things: first, a deterministic vision of history; second, the relevance and value of circumstance rather than action. In his eyes, the history of rulership of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms was not primarily grounded in continuous tradition. Rather, it was formed by the decisions and new relationships of its rulers.William claimed that he found relatively little of interest in the history of Mercia,[CITATION-101] and thought the kingdom barely worthy of record after Ceolwulf II (d..879). He thought Mercia had \u2018flourished\u2019 () suddenly under the rule of the overconfident pagan Uhtred, but \u2018decayed\u2019 () under the rule of Ceolwulf II(\u2018of a king only half-man\u2019), and so was seized by Alfred.[CITATION-102] Like the author of, William used gendered language here to criticise bad leadership. But \u00c6thelflaed had all the qualities he deemed excellent in a ruler:non pretermittatur soror regis Ethelfleda Etheredi relicta, non mediocre momentum partium, fauor ciuium, pauor hostium,[CITATION-103] immodici cordis femina \u2026 Virago potentissima multum fratrem consiliis iuuare, in urbibus extruendis non minus ualere \u2026[CITATION-104] we must not overlook the king\u2019s sister \u00c6thelflaed, \u00c6thelred\u2019s widow, of no small influence among those on her side, popular with her subjects and a terror to the enemy, a woman of spirit beyond measure \u2026 The most powerful virago greatly aided her brother in counsel, no less influential in building cities \u2026She was effective, persuasive and influential in leading war, in advising her brother Edward the Elder, and in building cities and the support of allies. In one version of, William claimed that she took the decision to maintain chastity after the birth of her daughter\u2014not for spiritual reasons, but because of complications with the birth of her first child and the affront this had presented to the dignity of a king\u2019s daughter.[CITATION-105] William stressed her role as paternal aunt () who, with her husband the ealdorman, raised and educated the future king \u00c6thelstan with great zeal ().[CITATION-106] William held that a combination of luck and character were the reasons for her successes. \u2018You cannot discern,\u2019 he wrote in direct address, \u2018whether luck or character were more important in enabling the woman to protect her own men and to terrify outsiders\u2019 ().[CITATION-107] He was certain that both factors were present. Her successes were entirely to her own credit, as the active verbs underline. Neither Providence nor her dynastic connection to the House of Wessex explained her remarkable abilities. For William, deterministic factors never sufficed to account for any ruler\u2019s successes or failures.[CITATION-108] Here, the interpretative quality of translation is important to note, because translating a Latin noun\u2014here,\u2014into English requires an indefinite or definite article, which in turn requires making a choice between the universal and the particular, respectively. Did William mean to imply that it is remarkable that \u2018a woman\u2019 (any woman at all) is successful, thus making a universal claim about women? Or did he mean that it is simply not obvious which factor made more of a difference in the success of \u2018the woman\u2019 (the woman he has just been writing about) in this particular case? The latter reading bears no implicit judgement that women were inherently less capable of protecting their men and terrifying foreigners, even if they were situated to do so less often. The only way to resolve this question is to establish if there is evidence in William\u2019s works for which view he held.It turns out there is. William did not find it unusual for a woman to wield power, nor remarkable that she should wield it well. The wordis susceptible to an etymological fallacy: that, because it derives from the root for man, it means \u2018manlike woman\u2019,[CITATION-109] rather than \u2018woman\u2019 (as in Genesis 2:23) or \u2018strong woman\u2019 (as for William). In English, for example, the word \u2018woman\u2019 derives from the root \u2018wife of man\u2019, but that is not its meaning: the terms are not synonyms. The best gauge of a word\u2019s meaning is its use, not its derivation. This distinction is also present in Isidore of Seville\u2019s early seventh-century. Isidore traced\u2019s etymology to a root through, and originating prior to, gender:back to(\u2018man\u2019, of whichwas an ancient form for \u2018woman\u2019), andin turn back to(\u2018strength\u2019). He distinguished between\u2019s derivation (a woman who acts in a manly way) and its meaning in use: it was a word used for strong women, or for women who perform a man\u2019s deeds.[CITATION-110] William usedalongsidefor \u00c6thelflaed, thus acknowledging that she was a woman, and a formidable one. His consistency in this use, and the positive import of the word, are evident from the contexts in which he used it: for \u00c6thelflaed, for praising Adela, daughter of William I, whom he honoured as a \u2018strong woman commended for earthly power\u2019 ()[CITATION-111] and who helped to secure Normandy for William Adelin,[CITATION-112] and for Matilda\u2019s just cause: \u2018the strong woman came to England to assert her right against Stephen\u2019 ().[CITATION-113] Unlike Hugh the Chanter, who used(\u2018masculine strong woman\u2019) for Adela, William did not usein conjunction with language for gendered behaviour.[CITATION-114] William ascribed strength to these women without qualifying that strength as masculine.[CITATION-115] Still more crucially, William did not view strong women only in comparison with other strong women. He implicitly compared \u00c6thelflaed with three ancient leaders\u2014Alexander the Great and his parents, Philip of Macedon and Olympias\u2014in borrowing language from Justin\u2019sof Pompeius Trogus\u2019s. According to Justin\u2019s account, strategic discussions about the war in Greece highlighted the value of Olympias\u2019s critical support and Alexander and Philip\u2019s influence among the people:Quibusdam placebat bellum in Macedoniam transferri, ad ipsum fontem et caput regni, ubi et Olympias esset, mater Alexandri,: sed in rem visum est ab Aegypto incipere, ne in Macedoniam profectis Asia a Ptolemaeo occuparetur.[CITATION-116] It was pleasing to some that the war should be transferred to Macedonia, to the very head and metropolis of the kingdom, where Alexander\u2019s mother Olympias was, who would be no small support to their party; while the favour of their countrymen would be with them because of the names of Alexander and Philip; but it seemed more to the purpose to begin with Egypt, lest, while they were gone into Macedonia, Asia should be seized by Ptolemy.Rodney Thomson has noted William\u2019s allusion to Olympias, observing that Justin\u2019s words () meant that Olympias\u2019s participation would make a significant contribution to those whom she supported.[CITATION-117] But William\u2019s characterisation of \u00c6thelflaed also alluded to the male emperors. Thomson, readingfor Justin\u2019s, thought that Justin\u2019sapplied to Olympias,[CITATION-118] where in fact Justin credited it to Alexander and Philip. William appropriated both Olympias\u2019s tide-turning influence () and Alexander and Philip\u2019s command of the citizens\u2019 favour () for \u00c6thelflaed: he viewed the qualities of eminent, imperial, ancient men and women who ruled well as qualities also possessed by \u00c6thelflaed, without reference to her sex or theirs.William was not alone in this regard. Henry normally abbreviated the material he drew from his sources for Anglo-Saxon history (primarily Bede and ASC),[CITATION-119] but for cases of exceptional glory, he added to it. Of all rulers of the English people in his mammoth, \u00c6thelflaed (twice) and William I (once) were the only two whom Henry both compared with and found superior to Caesar:Victrix natur[a]e, nomine digna uiri:/ Te, quo splendidior fieres, natura puellam,/ Te probitas fecit nomen habere uiri./ Te mutare decet, sed solam, nomina sexus,/ Tu regina potens rexque trophea parans./ Iam nec Cesarei tantum meruere triumphi,/ Cesare splendidior, uirgo uirago uale.[CITATION-120] Conqueror of nature, worthy of the name of a man: you were made a girl by nature, so that you were the more illustrious; your prowess made you have the name of a man. For you, but you alone, it is fitting to change the name of your sex; you a mighty queen and a king earning victories. Even the triumphs of Caesar did not gain so much. Virgin strong woman, more illustrious than Caesar, farewell.Willelmus omnium predictorum summus xxi anno glorifice splenduit. De quo dictum est:/ Cesariem Cesar tibi se natura negauit,/ Hanc Willelme tibi stella comata dedit.[CITATION-121] William, higher than all preceding, shone gloriously until his twenty-first year. Of whom it was said:/ If nature denied you, Caesar, luxuriant hair,/ The long-haired star, William, gave it to you.Not all rulers of the English whom Henry considered conquerors earned such high praise or marks of distinction. In Wessex, Ine defeated Geraint of the Welsh and the south Saxons, then gave up rulership \u2018happily\u2019 (), Cuthred conquered the Britons twice, Ecgbehrt retained the kingdom he conquered (),[CITATION-122] \u00c6thelwulf \u2018conquered\u2019 () the Danes at, and Eadred (brother of Edmund) \u2018obtained all parts of England happily\u2019 ();[CITATION-123] none, apparently, did so exceptionally. What kind of conqueror, then, merited terms such as illustrious and glorious, and superlatives about quality of rulership?In Henry\u2019s view, distinctive, outstanding or illustrious rule had to demonstrate unvanquished excellence in one of two ways: on the offensive in the conquest of formidable enemies, or in personal piety. First, excellence in battle. \u00c6thelbald the Proud () of Mercia was eminent in conquest, but not glorious: he ravaged Northumbria, \u2018conquered the Welsh people\u2019 () and \u2018was chief among the kings of England\u2019 (), but was conquered by Cuthred of Wessex and killed.[CITATION-124] Edward the Elder of Wessex, however, did earn glory\u2014not for conquering, but for excelling in conquest, and overcoming the strongest of enemies. He fought the Danes on multiple fronts: first in Northumbria, and then in Mercia, where he \u2018vanquished them gloriously and killed strong kings\u2019 (), before he defeated them at Tettenhall and \u2018conquered Mercia\u2019 ().[CITATION-125] For some conquerors\u2019 victories, the ruler did not merit exclusive personal credit. If it was not clear that a ruler had acted alone, eminence yielded no superlatives. For King Alfred\u2019s victory in 894, \u2018Omnipotent God gave them victory at the opportune moment\u2019 ().[CITATION-126] At the Battle of Tettenhall in 910 the Lord \u2018destroyed the infidels in a great crushing defeat\u2019 ()[CITATION-127] on Edward the Elder\u2019s behalf (a victory Henry credited to Edward directly in his summary),[CITATION-128] and Henry did not know who the victor was at the Battle of Holme.[CITATION-129] Without the West Saxon annals\u2019 evidence of human initiative and influence, Henry did not claim surpassing glory for these rulers.Second, excellence in personal piety. Eadberht of Northumbria, frail in life, became a monk and met \u2018with a glorious end\u2019 ().[CITATION-130] \u00c6thelred of Mercia, son of Penda, \u2018gloriously became a monk\u2019 ().[CITATION-131] King Edgar the Peaceable () of Wessex worked \u2018to pacify\u2019 () the people and reigned in the service of God. Although Henry tempered this praise, calling Edgar too generous to pagans and foreigners, he wrote that Edgar \u2018ruled with peace and greater glory than all others\u2019 (),[CITATION-132] and was thus worthy both of distinction and glory.What, then, of those rulers who earned distinction\u2014and illustriousness or glory\u2014in conquests both of body and spirit? Henry named \u00c6thelflaed queen and king because she appeared to rule exceptionally, alone, and in her own right. Because Henry lacked the West Saxon version of events for 914\u2013920 that told of Edward the Elder\u2019s reconquests,[CITATION-133] \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s victories would have appeared (from the Mercian Register) to have been almost single-handed. Her Wessex heritage played no part in his encomium: he did not know \u00c6thelflaed was Alfred\u2019s daughter, probably thinking her \u00c6thelred of Mercia\u2019s daughter, not his wife.[CITATION-134] Henry twice observed that \u00c6thelred was ill, that \u00c6thelflaed \u2018was reigning under him in his infirmity\u2019 (), and that he gave her Mercia (\u2018his land\u2019,) after his death because he had no son.[CITATION-135] Henry recognised her experience in ruling and that \u00c6thelred appointed her because the times required her leadership.Henry cited \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s high degree of military prowess (\u2018of such worth\u2019,), thus crediting the view that she promised to be a surpassingly excellent ruler: \u2018it was thought and said\u2019 () that had she not been seized by fate before her time (), \u2018she would have surpassed all men in valour\u2019 ().[CITATION-136] Cnut of Denmark, who conquered England in 1016, was \u2018greater than all his predecessors\u2019 and \u2018reigned gloriously\u2019 (); the conqueror William I, likewise, was the highest of all those previously named, and shone with glory ().[CITATION-137] \u00c6thelflaed embodied ideal rulership in overcoming odds. To Henry, the nature of the odds faced by a ruler mattered less than the degree and scale of success they achieved. For example, \u00c6thelstan was an imperial leader and victor over the strongest of forces; and for this reason Henry expanded on ASC 934 rather than contracting it. \u00c6thelstan shone () unconquered (). He \u2018could never be conquered in war\u2019 () and merited terms redolent of Roman eternal victory: he \u2018returned\u2019 from battle with the \u2018triumphal laurel\u2019 ().[CITATION-138] For Henry, these deeds were not enough to merit poetry[CITATION-139] or the honour of a comparison to Caesar. \u00c6thelflaed, by contrast, was also a \u2018conqueror of nature\u2019 ()\u2014meaning natural condition: in this case, being born a girl ()\u2014for which reason she was more illustrious (). What this means is important: it was precisely because she was a woman that she could be more illustrious than other rulers. As a ruler compared with other rulers, she was distinctive because she conquered obstacles. In realising her capacity to be a conqueror, she deserved a conqueror\u2019s glory.What \u00c6thelflaed, Cnut and William I had in common was that they distinguished themselves in rulership not just because they won victories over the enemy, but because they won even greater victories over themselves. Bede, Henry\u2019s source and model, also admired conquering rulers,[CITATION-140] but Henry went further in dramatising their personal dominion and inner victories. Cnut had an epiphany of humility when he realised he could not command the waves, and experienced compunction when receiving the news of a massacre of hostages at Sandwich.[CITATION-141] Henry wrote of William I becoming markedly less violent once he became king, claiming that he achieved concord in England after the Conquest and was \u2018exceptionally powerful\u2019 () in administrating the 1086 Domesday survey.[CITATION-142] In remaining a virgin (Henry believed), winning battles and ruling a kingdom first in practice and then in name, \u00c6thelflaed defeated physical desire and the challenges of her natural condition. Henry was no feminist: in the style of contemporary Latin poets, he praised her strength in showing manly virtue.[CITATION-143] Rather than viewing as liabilities such conditions as being pagan, female, or a foreign conqueror, he viewed them as assets when they allowed for a more glorious sally toward a ruler\u2019s greatest strength.Aelred\u2019s concise genealogy of kings merits a brief mention here, for which Henry\u2019swas a source. Addressed to the future Henry II,[CITATION-144] related this ruler\u2019s illustrious heritage (male and female), including remarkable leaders of the English in his past.[CITATION-145] Aelred praised \u00c6thelflaed, though she was neither king nor progenitor of a royal line:Adjecit etiam decoris plurimum soror regis Aelfleda, sexu quidem femina, sed animo ac virtute plus viro, quae exceptis his quas rex aedificaverat urbes construxit, Brunesburch, Bruge, Scorgate, Thamewrthe, Swaford, Edebirath, Werewicum, Ciresbirith, Warebirich, Runconere, Liecestre. Ipsa pugnavit contra Walenses et vicit, et Derebi expugnavit et cepit. Tantaque fortitudine emicuit, ut a pluribus rex diceretur.[CITATION-146] The king\u2019s sister, \u00c6thelflaed, added a great deal of nobility. In sex she was a woman, but in spirit and strength more a man, who built cities, excepting those the king [Edward the Elder of Wessex] had erected,, Bridgnorth, Scorgate, Tamworth, Stafford, Eddisbury, Warwick, Chirbury, Warebury, Runcorn, Leicester. She herself fought the Welsh and bested them, and she stormed Derby and took it. She displayed such courage that many called her king.In affirming that \u00c6thelflaed was a woman perceived as, while in two qualities \u2018more\u2019 ()\u2014but not fully or exclusively\u2014a man, Aelred, like Henry, refrained from ascribing binary gender. The clue to \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s presence inis the first word,(\u2018added\u2019): she herself (\u2014an emphatic) increased the honour of English rulers. To augment a lineage required neither male birth nor being a parent of rulers, but independent action and success.John of Worcester engaged in a different enterprise: writing a new version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in Latin.[CITATION-147] His individual changes, though subtle, amount to a marked reframing of \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s autonomy and consummate quality as a ruler. As in ASC, \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s being female was not discussed. To cultivate an impressive English history, John rewrote ASC to accord rulers more agency and influence: he highlighted efficiency and successes rather than failures.[CITATION-148] All rulers were stronger in his account, but some were stronger than others.John\u2019s account of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the early tenth century, and the formation of the English kingdom, is a story less national than lordly in character. The English rulers of Mercia and Wessex protected their borders from foreign incursions, winning support from leaders of other realms. The achievements he highlighted in rulers of this era were lordship (leading followers), expansion, and duration of rule, especially when retained against threats. Edward the Elder, \u2018most invincible king of the English\u2019 (), \u2018most gloriously\u2019 () led \u2018all the inhabitants of Britain\u2019 (): English, Scots, Cumbrians, Danes and Welsh.[CITATION-149] John added details to \u00c6thelstan\u2019s reign to stress his imperial intentions and successes: after expelling Guthfrith and Ealdred (in ASC MSS E, F), \u00c6thelstan added Guthfrith\u2019s kingdom to his own dominion, then sought and made a \u2018firm treaty\u2019 (\u2026). \u00c6thelstan\u2019s epithet is \u2018vigorous and glorious king of the English\u2019 (),[CITATION-150] and John usedfor other rulers, including King Harold II.[CITATION-151] John thought that \u00c6thelflaed, compared to other rulers, excelled in military leadership, the length of her tenure, and autonomous rule. Responding to Scandinavian threats on multiple fronts, she commanded and gave effective orders before and during her formal rule of Mercia. John elaborated on the Mercian Register, already favourable to her accomplishments, by specifying that she had more personal autonomy, influence, divine favour, and quality as a leader. The Register explained that with God\u2019s help, \u00c6thelflaed built Tamworth and Stafford (913), captured Derby (917), and peacefully took control of Leicester with divine aid (918).[CITATION-152] Whereas for William and Henry, subduing or ignoring the element of divine intervention was a way to highlight a ruler\u2019s independence, John, unusually, retained this claim of divine support, which he did in theonly to highlight support for rightful causes.[CITATION-153] In rewriting \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s deeds in the Mercian Register, John increased her active leadership in caring for a British and Anglo-Saxon past and planning for the future. Asshe built four towns, erected two fortresses, and founded Eddisbury and Warwick\u2014foundations mentioned in the Mercian Register, but not attributed directly to her there.[CITATION-154] He newly attributed the restoration of Caerllion (his British name for Chester) to the joint command of Ealdorman \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelflaed (),[CITATION-155] thereby highlighting her part in joint rulership before she became. He claimed that she restored (), rather than built, Tamworth.[CITATION-156] In naming \u00c6thelflaed and her husband authors of urban restoration, including a pre-English city, John made them, in effect, custodians of the past.For John, \u00c6thelflaed illustrated the long history of influential, worthy rulers of the English. He made a significant intervention at the beginning of her reign: after her husband \u00c6thelred\u2019s death, \u2018\u00c6thelflaed, daughter of king Alfred, held the kingdom of the Mercians (except London and Oxford, which her brother King Edward the Elder retained) most vigorously, and for a considerable period of time\u2019 ().[CITATION-157] The Mercian Register mentioned neither the extent of her control, nor the length of her dominion, nor the vigour of her rule. Here, John made this Mercian ruler\u2019s accomplishments supersede even those of the praiseworthy, imperial ruler Edward the Elder, who is relegated to a subordinate clause.John expanded on, and added precision to, \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s military prowess and strategic thinking as a leader, asserting her autonomy and influence especially when she acted independently.[CITATION-158] She responded efficiently to heathen Danish raids: when they attacked, she gave hostages on the condition they will leave(\u2018as quickly as possible\u2019). While the Danes hid shamefully in their ships, she chose to stand and fight. She led a staunch defence against the heathens: John wrote that the Danes could only collect booty on their retreat, not during the siege, implying that the English forces were stronger. He turned the English killing of hundreds of Danes (as in the Mercian Register) into thousands, making the feat more impressive. \u00c6thelflaed sent an army () into Wales and took the fortress, taking the Welsh king\u2019s wife and thirty-four men to Mercia as captives.[CITATION-159] John credited \u00c6thelflaed personally with taking Derby \u2018by assault\u2019 (), also adding to the Mercian Register account that her army fought bravely. John highlighted \u00c6thelflaed and Edward\u2019s allied deeds of reconquest on behalf of the \u2018many English\u2019 () and \u2018all the country people\u2019 () living under pagan rule. In the Mercian Register the people survived; here, they survived rejoicing () at their escape.[CITATION-160] The Mercian Register recorded the events, but the scale of success and leadership is stronger in John\u2019s chronicle.In a notable change, John cast \u00c6thelflaed as a ruler who established dominion over other rulers. In this he was original. The formality and prestige of this arrangement is stronger than in the Mercian Register, wherein the people of York () promise to be under her rule: \u20187 h\u00e6fdon eac Eforwicingas hire gehaten, 7 sume on wedde geseald, sume mid a\u00feum gef\u00e6stnod, \u00fe\u00e6t hi on hyre r\u00e6denne beon woldon\u2019 (\u2018And also the people of York had promised her, and some granting by pledge, some with oaths, that they would be guided by her rule\u2019).[CITATION-161] In John\u2019s version, however, she accepts the full and complete submission of the Danes who ruled () in York: \u2018the Danes who ruled York affirmed, some by treaty, some by oath, that they would assent to her will and judgement in all things\u2019 ().[CITATION-162] Neither the Scandinavians nor their governing of York appear in the Mercian Register. Thus, in the, \u00c6thelflaed accepts not the submission of people, but the submission of rulers, themselves conquerors and foreigners. That the Danes submit to \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s will in all things shows their submission is complete and unconditional, a totality of victory that is new in John\u2019s version. John created an impression of a strong royal will in stressing her capacity as ruler of Mercia and overlord of the Danish rulers of York.[CITATION-163] In his verdict on \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s rule, John adapted material from the Mercian Register[CITATION-164] and introduced eulogistic praise:\u00c6gelfleda Merciorum domina insignis prudentie et iustitie, uirtutisque eximie femina, .viii. anno ex quo sola regnum Merciorum strenuo iustoque rexit moderamine, .xix. kalend Iul. obiit, et unicam filiam suam Aewynnam ex Aetheredo subregulo susceptam, heredem regni reliquit.[CITATION-165] \u00c6thelflaed, lord of the Mercians, distinguished by her prudence and justice, a woman of outstanding virtue, in the eighth year after which she began to rule on her own the kingdom of the Mercians with vigorous and just government, died on the nineteenth day before the calends of July, leaving \u00c6lfwynn, her only daughter by \u00c6thelred, the underking, as heiress to her kingdom.Her burial with honour shows that her contemporaries recognised the quality of her rule. In specifying that \u00c6thelflaed provided for the succession for \u00c6lfwynn, he gave her agency over the succession.[CITATION-166] He wrote that \u00c6thelflaed ruled alone) to make her independence unambiguous.\u00c6thelflaed emerges on par with other tenth-century rulers of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, as John\u2019s changes to earlier accounts show. John assumed no male dominance in cases of joint rule. He increased the parity between \u00c6thelflaed and her husband \u00c6thelred in decision-making, and between \u00c6thelflaed and Edward in military endeavours. She ruled as lord and overlord: she led her followers in her own name and secured the submission of other rulers, as Edward and \u00c6thelstan did; her rule endured a long time, like \u00c6thelstan\u2019s treaty. In other ways, she exceeded them. Edward and \u00c6thelstan were strong, glorious, successful, but John did not single them out for their military prowess: where they were, only \u00c6thelflaed merited the superlative, in acting. She shared with her contemporaries the key quality of overlordship of other rulers, whereas prudence, justice, virtue, effecting restoration, and surpassing military strength were qualities particular to her. There are two related implications of John\u2019s views. First, gender was irrelevant. Second, a person who ruled a larger kingdom (such as England versus an Anglo-Saxon kingdom), or one with more sub-rulers (such as Wessex compared to Mercia), did not necessarily rule with greater distinction. What interested John was the quality of rulership relative to the scale of the kingdom and its unique challenges. In this regard, \u00c6thelflaed merited parity with, and distinction among, other rulers of the English.William, Henry, John and Aelred, with different historical sources and perspectives, highlighted \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s autonomy and lordship to a greater degree than their sources. They thought \u00c6thelflaed an excellent ruler, and cited her honour and reputation among her contemporaries. They signalled her distinction and overlordship with superlatives, exactly as Bede had done to distinguish rulers who reigned over an(a realm of more than one kingdom or people) rather than a(one kingdom), and classical writers before him.[CITATION-167] They compared \u00c6thelflaed with other rulers on the basis of action and achievement.In their narratives, ruling well depended on human capacity and a proven ability to command, and gendered thought cannot account for their judgements. There is no evidence that twelfth-century English writers imagined a link between \u00c6thelflaed and Matilda. They did not compare them with each other, nor with women as an abstract category. \u00c6thelflaed had ruled the Mercians for years before her election; Matilda, before her father\u2019s death, had mostly lived abroad. William thought Matilda strong for asserting her right ();[CITATION-168] \u00c6thelflaed wielded authority unexpectedly, but well. Henry supported Matilda\u2019s right, but claimed that for \u00c6thelflaed, and only \u00c6thelflaed, should the name of her sex be changed. John and the Gloucester continuator\u2019scriticised both Stephen and Matilda at times; John uniformly endorsed \u00c6thelflaed.[CITATION-169] \u00c6thelflaed and Matilda offered two otherwise unrelated examples of strong rulers, one of whom, writers agreed, ruled exceptionally well.It has been claimed that women in the Anglo-Norman world could only wield power \u2018as men\u2019;[CITATION-170] or, on the other hand, that political opponents condemned women who acted in a masculine manner.[CITATION-171] The flaw in these conclusions is the assumption that, because female rule was rare and unprecedented, binary gender dominated the language of leadership. This was not the case. Some writers used gendered language for the behaviour of women and men: William\u2019s bad Mercian king was;made partisan slurs about both sexes; Aelred named \u00c6thelflaed more man than woman. These examples suggest that behaving in a \u2018manly\u2019 way was seen as virtuous, but it was not the only, nor the best, way to excel.In these historians\u2019 views of any ruler, being female was not an inherent handicap, nor a diminishing quality, nor a valid reason to compare her only with other women. David Carpenter discussed Matilda\u2019s claim in the context of, and in comparison with, female rulers, including continental consorts and the biblical queen Judith.[CITATION-172] Contemporaries did not. T. Gregory Foster, similarly, wrote in 1892 of \u00c6thelflaed as a new Judith.[CITATION-173] Neither the Mercian Register nor twelfth-century writers invoked Judith or queens consort as comparisons for \u00c6thelflaed. They invoked emperors, conquerors, leaders. Henry framed being born a girl as an opportunity for success. Like being pagan, ignobly born, or foreign, it was one possible condition for earning surpassing glory. \u00c6thelflaed outdid other rulers in the same way as other conquerors of realm and self. Henry proposed changing the name of \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s sex. He did not, however, make her gender binary. In naming her \u2018queen and king\u2019 (), Henry articulated the idea that a person could simultaneously hold a woman\u2019s role and a man\u2019s role, and merit praise for that very reason. For these writers, no circumstance of birth\u2014for \u00c6thelflaed, for \u00c6thelstan, for Caesar\u2014could diminish a ruler\u2019s inborn, equal capacity for glorious rule.For rulers past, present and prospective, writers thought that the stakes of rulership were related to action. There are parallels with other northern societies that were long connected with the English kingdoms through invasion and settlement. Carol J. Clover has argued that in early medieval Scandinavia, personality, ambition and social relations mattered more for an individual\u2019s status than \u2018bodily sex\u2019. Fears for both men and women concerned impotence and lack of power. To win much-desired \u2018distinction\u2019, they needed to act, and act again.[CITATION-174] Our writers would have been aware that succession customs favoured male heirs. Western post-Roman ruling dynasties such as the Merovingians and Carolingians had no reigning women. Rulership contingent on election and leadership, with opportunities created but not guaranteed by patrilineal succession, was widespread, not least in the Saxon dukes\u2019 bids for power and the rise of the Ottonians in the tenth century.[CITATION-175] In 919, Henry, duke of Saxony, was elected king of Germany by Franconian and Saxon princes and led a coalition of duchies against foreign invasions.[CITATION-176] Similarly, in terms of her election and leadership, \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s rule of Mercia was not unusual by early medieval standards. Matilda did not alert twelfth-century writers to a powerful woman: history alerted them to a powerful ruler, and comparative thinking alerted them to similarities among rulers who conquered odds and stimulated them to establish \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s lordship, overlordship and merit.These chroniclers\u2019 narratives of tenth-century Anglo-Saxon rulership have broader implications for their view of history. They knew rulers faced the threat of conquest, whether by Scandinavian invader or West Saxon ally, and admired excellent leadership in a perilous historical era. They also knew the outcomes. Yet each thought a peerless ruler\u2014one not moulded by circumstance\u2014was a person who exerted a turning force on events that might have turned out otherwise. Because they maintained that both Mercia and Wessex had rulers who exercised this leadership of moment, their view of history did not present \u2018England\u2019\u2014even Norman England\u2014as an inevitable conclusion.Twelfth-century Latin writers\u2019 views of \u2018the Anglo-Saxon past\u2019 have been presented on a spectrum running between two extremes: on one end, as a product of post-Conquest nostalgia[CITATION-177] or revival of \u2018the\u2019 English nation and English identity;[CITATION-178] on the other, as proprietary, colonial voices of an Anglo-Norman elite imposing a new \u2018Englishness\u2019 and seeking to \u2018write the English out of their own history\u2019.[CITATION-179] Recent work on what \u2018the Anglo-Saxon past\u2019 looked like from the twelfth century has stressed that writers perceived continuity across the Norman Conquest.[CITATION-180] This formula implies a unity,[CITATION-181] both in historical thinking and in the subject-matter of history, that is not supported by the evidence.The residue of different possible histories persisted in the different pictures of Anglo-Saxon history preserved in twelfth-century chronicles. Monastic writers rewrote their own pre-Conquest histories, in charters and local histories as well as annals and.[CITATION-182] Even in the mid-twelfth century, history looked very different from Canterbury than it did from Worcester, or Huntingdon.[CITATION-183] From Henry\u2019s perspective, where the West Saxon historical record for the tenth century was obscure, tenth-century Mercian rulership appeared distinguished: in Alfred\u2019s and Edward\u2019s wars, God punished the invaders; in \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s wars (and England\u2019s eleventh-century conquests), rulers defended and invaders punished themselves. But the bilingual Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (MS F) of Canterbury (closely related to Peterborough\u2019s MS E) did not name \u00c6thelflaed, though its author knew her as Edward\u2019s sister, and tenth-century Mercia vanished almost entirely in a story that looked like a West Saxon conquest of Britain.[CITATION-184] \u2018The Anglo-Saxon past\u2019 did not exist in the twelfth century: English pasts, however, did.The Anglo-Norman writers offered clear pictures of the distinct polities in England\u2019s tenth-century past and their leaders, wherein each kingdom\u2019s autonomy, rather than a gradual process of agglomeration to \u2018England\u2019 with West Saxon origins, remained a guiding theme. For these chroniclers, \u00c6thelflaed was noteworthy because she ruled well, and ruled Mercia well. Her importance to them was not any role in \u2018the creation of a unified English kingdom\u2019, as Theresa Earenfight has argued of Henry of Huntingdon.[CITATION-185] Henry never associated \u00c6thelflaed with unity. John and his team wrote at Worcester, where Alfred\u2019s Wessex court had lingering links, and whence the Mercian annals, contested by the Wessex chronicle tradition, probably sprang.[CITATION-186] John\u2019s changes to the \u00c6thelflaed narrative did not anticipate a unified future: they recalled leaders\u2019 deeds undertaken to preserve the past, to defend the present, and to build for their kingdom\u2019s future. His assertion that \u00c6thelflaed chose \u00c6lfwynn as her successor\u2014more explicit than his sources\u2014hardly sets up Edward the Elder\u2019s subsequent conquest of Mercia honourably. Even in praising Edward\u2019s imperial victories, John was unwilling to suppress the Mercians\u2019 interest in self-determination, though it did not last long beyond \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s death. Nor was \u00c6thelflaed a cog in any onward-pressing machine of unity for William of Malmesbury. William admired the peaceful impulse of a treaty that divided England into the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex, once again, as late as 1016: he praised Edmund Ironside for accepting Cnut\u2019s proposal that Edmund rule Mercia, and Cnut Wessex.[CITATION-187] William believed that Edmund was murdered shortly thereafter, and that this was cause for regret and grief, not relief that England was reunited.These Latin chroniclers were not obedient mouthpieces of an Anglo-Norman elite,[CITATION-188] but bilingual historians\u2014each with a particular outlook on the past\u2014who were interested in rulers past and present, in what they did and what people thought of them, and in communicating it in writing. They made their knowledge of Mercian rulership available in another language. They did not suppress Mercian history to serve a West Saxon agenda: they rescued it from the prospect of oblivion. At times they ranked the glory of a Mercian ruler higher than that of rulers of Wessex, Norman England, or the Roman Empire.Their story of Anglo-Saxon rulers was pragmatic rather than dynastic, which reflected historic and recent experience. In the eleventh century, Cnut, Harold Godwineson, and William I (who asserted his claim to the English throne through kinship with Emma of Normandy) did not inherit from their fathers; in the twelfth, King Stephen (William I\u2019s grandson) claimed the throne through his mother, Adela of Blois. No law governed English succession before or after the Conquest: an interplay of factors, and the weight of several successes, made some (like coronation) more significant over time.[CITATION-189] \u00c6thelflaed, ruling Mercia through marriage and election, was no aberration. Chroniclers considered her among the best of rulers, and not because she was Alfred\u2019s daughter. They thought less in terms of nostalgia and genealogy (thinking back), and more in terms of the substance a great ruler added\u2014as Aelred stated explicitly of \u00c6thelflaed\u2014to the story (thinking forwards).Their Anglo-Saxon histories highlighted the dynamic of changing relations between distinct polities. As William and John knew, \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s rule of Mercia originated in leadership experience and a relationship forged between two kingdoms. Under \u00c6thelstan, according to William, England formed as a result of ancient right and new relationships, with West Saxon, Mercian, and Scandinavian ruling families. Mercia became a strong defensive ally of Wessex, and Northumbria a part of England, as much through right as through the actions of tenth-century people. There is a strong sense of contingency here. The idea that chroniclers saw \u2018continuity\u2019 as a characteristic of the past partly obscures their sense of history happening through rulers\u2019 independent actions. And, for William, merit, not inheritance, made a person worthy of memory.Their thinking allowed for both shared and specific challenges. Tenth- and twelfth-century rulers alike asserted lordship and sought loyalty. Writers perceived that the independence and overlordship of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms changed during the Wessex\u2013Mercia alliance and reconquests of kingdoms from Scandinavian rulers. Similarly, in twelfth-century England and Normandy, landholders faced conflicting obligations because of the dynamic relationship between the two realms: separate under William Rufus and Robert Curthose, joined under Henry I, and separated again when Stephen lost Normandy to Geoffrey of Anjou in 1144. Writers thought a ruler\u2019s priorities were to lead, to manage, to provide, to excel; a leader\u2019s response made the measure of her, or his, success, and they framed their narratives accordingly.These writers told of great deeds done,, and not of national progress. Deeds did not become more impressive with time, nor with a bigger England. Absolute values\u2014sum of victories, size of conquest, sweep of realm\u2014were no part of their historical thought. The mark of sophistication in their historical reasoning, and comparative thinking, is that they assessed the degree of a ruler\u2019s achievement relative to its historical moment, and evaluated a ruler against her or his own obstacles.What explains the thinking of these writers, at this moment? The situation of women in their own present was of limited relevance. Neither the inheritance of heiresses, nor Matilda\u2019s candidacy for the crown, illuminate their comparative thought about \u00c6thelflaed. What is compelling is their historical inheritance: the evidence. The case for \u00c6thelflaed\u2019s excellence as a ruler was there, in the Mercian Register. They knew it, and judged it true. Their knowledge of classical tales of deeds, their interest in them as success stories, their curiosity about rulers in English history, and the presence of different sources for the same events, combined to invite comparison. The materials were at hand; they wanted only an inquiring mind and a ready pen.What, ultimately, did our writers say about themselves and their own thinking? Where John and Aelred are silent, we must turn to the self-reflective William and Henry. William discussed his work with Matilda of Scotland, wife of Henry I, and claimed that discussions with her inspired and shaped the content of his.[CITATION-190] He wrote of her family, her ideas, her suggestions and her persistence, without ascribing her interest in his project to specifically female concerns. She appears as a person just as curious about history as William himself. Henry, reflecting as he often did on his own thinking and on the fleeting nature of earthly glory,[CITATION-191] advised that \u2018we wish\u2019 (\u2014here, expressing a collective effort) for true glory in heaven. He was musing on the deeds of forty-five emperors of Britain and Rome. We can all, he wrote, learn something valuable from their deeds and aspirations by comparison (; \u2018by comparison with them, we may figure out\u2019). The collective \u2018we\u2019 means people. Henry did not view himself writing as a man in the role of historian. In his own words,: \u2018I speak as a human\u2019.[CITATION-192] ",
