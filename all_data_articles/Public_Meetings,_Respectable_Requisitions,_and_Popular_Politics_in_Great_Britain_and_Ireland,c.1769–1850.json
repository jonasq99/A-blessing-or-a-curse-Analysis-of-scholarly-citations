    "article": "This article examines the practice of \u2018requisitioning\u2019 public meetings in Great Britain and Ireland. These written requests to office-holders emerged in Ireland and then Great Britain, following bitter contests over the authenticity and authority of addresses and meetings claiming to represent a county or town in the decade after 1769. If the Seditious Meetings Acts privileged meetings officially convened by local elites, they also codified the practice of householders signing their own advertisements to requisition meetings under magisterial oversight. This would, especially when revolutionary threats receded and local justices\u2019 sympathies permitted, allow local organisers some legal and constitutional claims to public assembly, even if Peterloo demonstrated the continuing threat of the Riot Act. Alongside bi-partisan opportunism encouraging public meetings, the article emphasises the creative use of constitutional and legal claims by \u2018political entrepreneurs\u2019. Comparison with Ireland demonstrates ministers\u2019 greater recourse to new legislation and executive powers, but also the exchange of political practices with Great Britain. The prosecution of intimidating numbers, rather than seditious conduct, after 1842 diminished the role of requisitions, as did the hybridisation of \u2018public meetings\u2019. This was not so much the loss of a demotic form of community deliberation, but a proliferation and multiplication of the meetings\u2014and voices\u2014claiming to represent public opinion. The changing uses of a subscriptional practice can illuminate the relationship between government initiatives and local enforcement, and highlight the talents of those forging new meanings of the law, the constitution, and the political nation from restrictive procedures.In 1817, William Arundell Harris \u2018damned himself to everlasting shame\u2019, at least in the eyes of political reformers and the radical press. As High Sheriff of Cornwall, he received a requisition for \u2018a meeting of the freeholdersof the county; which meeting he refused to call, because he was required to summon the inhabitants as well as the freeholders\u2019. In his official reply to the requisition, Harris expressed disgust at the notion that \u2018the freeholders and \u201c\u201d\u2019 would \u2018question, under my presidency, the wisdom of Parliament, and the propriety of imposing restraint on the seditious\u2019 in proposed legislation. Rather, he declared melodramatically that \u2018I cannot comply with the request of the requisitionists\u2014or give the slightest sanction to proceedings, of which the probable result will be the overthrow of the existing Government of this Kingdom, and the total subversion of our inestimable Constitution\u2019. Yet the meeting went ahead, and, notwithstanding such fears, no historian has yet traced Britain\u2019s first modern revolution to the subsequent gathering in Bodmin. Addressing that meeting, one of the \u2018requisitionists\u2019, the county magistrate John Colman Rashleigh, responded that if \u2018we have no right to question what takes place in Parliament, the term PETITION should be obliterated from our statute books; as we can only assemble to vote adulatory addresses to the Throne\u2019. Rashleigh whipped up the crowd with a series of rhetorical questions, asking what had ended the American war, banned the slave trade, and defended the Toleration Act? The answer, in each case, was \u2018the Petitions of the People\u2019, which had been \u2018productive of more salutary effects to the Constitution, than any other\u2019 liberty they possessed. The general inhabitants could not otherwise \u2018from their cots and hamlets, state either their wishes or their grievances\u2019, and they lost the opportunity for \u2018their judgements to be informed, or their ideas enlarged, if they are not allowed to attend public meetings\u2019. For this reason, Rashleigh mocked the idea \u2018that the right of Petition should not be allowed to large assemblies of the People, but be committed to a chosen few, who shall exercise it almost like conspirators\u2019, as Harris and the Tory government proposed.Chronicling these events, the radical editor William Hone concluded that \u2018[m]ayors and sheriffs sometimes exercise theiras if it conferred on them ato do wrong\u2019.[CITATION-1] But how did they exercise such power, and what was this \u2018requisition\u2019 that they might deny? The answers lie scattered among local government records and private papers in archives across Great Britain and Ireland. Requisitions to an office-holder asked him to convene a meeting, which Harris refused, though the signatories might still try to proceed and publicise a signed advertisement on their own initiative, as Rashleigh did. Being formal, written requests to an authority, bearing signatures or authorised names, requisitions are best considered as a species of petition, though they often sought meetings that would in turn generate a more numerously signed petition to another authority.[CITATION-2] Considering the \u2018form, function, and meanings\u2019 of political activities such as petitioning and meeting allows us to trace their \u2018hybridisation\u2019, as Joanna Innes argues, identifying \u2018cross-fertilization between existing types\u2019 of political participation as much as their popularisation.[CITATION-3] Requisitions raised two intertwined dilemmas over the \u2018representative claim\u2019 of speaking for a community: who could call and who should participate in such a meeting?[CITATION-4] Tracing the emergence and adaptation of requisitions in the British Isles illuminates a number of mature historiographical themes, not least how \u2018the press, the platform, and the petition\u2019 came to be so firmly identified as constituting \u2018public opinion\u2019 in Victorian Britain.[CITATION-5] This historicises the \u2018public sphere\u2019, or the emergence of a \u2018counter-public sphere\u2019, by contextualising \u2018vigorous print arguments about public opinion\u2019 that materialised in \u2018concrete assemblies\u2019 such as public meetings.[CITATION-6] Disputes over requisitions reveal practices surrounding the languages of the \u2018constitutional idiom\u2019 and those rationalities too easily dismissed as \u2018a general addiction to the forms and proprieties of organized constitutionalism\u2019.[CITATION-7] While Charles Tilly\u2019s social movement studies have located expanding repertoires of contentious politics in the \u2018parliamentarisation\u2019 of political demands in this period, a study of requisitions highlights how any \u2018rise of the public meeting\u2019 rested on local conflicts involving what Katrina Navickas terms \u2018the politics of space and place\u2019.[CITATION-8] Moreover, comparison between Ireland and Great Britain highlights not only the exceptional legislation against popular assembly in the former, but also the extent of ministers\u2019 reliance on local elites for political repression within the latter. This points to another interplay between local contexts and national patterns in enforcing \u2018the law\u2019 in reality.[CITATION-9] Focusing on practices, which materialised who the \u2018public should be\u2019 in the public meetings of a locale, may allow us to sidestep abstract \u2018phases\u2019 of democratisation centred on expansions of the parliamentary franchise for irregular elections.[CITATION-10] The first section of this article considers the definition, origin, and function of requisitions in Ireland and Great Britain, before reviewing their adaptation in relation to the changing nature of \u2018public meetings\u2019. Since this identifies their rise and decline in the context of legislative and judicial innovations, a second section considers these changes more fully by disentangling the roles of parliamentarians, officials, justices, and agitators, evaluating how far requisitions ultimately constrained or assisted the proliferation of public meetings. Finally, a third section focuses on the functions of requisitions as material assertions of who should meet to decide what questions. As the conclusion emphasises, the cumulative choices of local officials, organisers, and audiences ultimately weakened the privileges of organising public meetings by mid-century, even if ministers and judges succeeded in branding truly massive assemblies as \u2018seditious\u2019. A study of the requisition as a legal and cultural practice points towards the social creativity that repurposed formal structures intended to restrict new forms of political organisation. From this perspective, the spread of ticketed or non-deliberative \u2018public meetings\u2019 from the 1830s onwards marked the surrender, as much as the assertion, of a monopoly over who might call and attend meetings that spoke for a locality.Signed requests to call public meetings speaking for a locality acquired the name \u2018requisition\u2019 slowly and haphazardly. Clearly, requisitions formed part of a group of related rituals for advertising a meeting publicly, asserting its legality, and claiming to represent a community.[CITATION-11] When approved, requisitions could be reprinted for publicity in broadsides or newspapers; when declined, organisers might proceed regardless under their own initiative, as John Colman Rashleigh did, often repurposing the requisition as their own signed announcement.[CITATION-12] Requisitions for public meetings hybridised formal eighteenth-century requests for meetings of closed bodies, such as corporations, common halls, or burghs, with the advertised summons of \u2018general meetings\u2019 for a county\u2019s freeholders or, in Scotland, heritors.[CITATION-13] Rather than convening a body to administer a county, town, or parish, requisitions for deliberative \u2018public meetings\u2019 sought to pronounce on resolutions, addresses, or petitions.[CITATION-14] A distinct form of electoral requisition, used to demonstrate and marshal support for parliamentary candidates, falls outside the scope of this article but clearly shared some characteristics with the requisitions considered here.[CITATION-15] The noun \u2018requisition\u2019, following Latin usage, had a plethora of other meanings in legal, diplomatic, and military terminology, but thedates the transitive verb \u2018to requisition\u2019 to a county meeting in Ireland in 1800.[CITATION-16] Occasional specification of a \u2018written requisition\u2019 or \u2018public requisition\u2019 distinguished these documents from an oral and private tradition of asking office-holders to call and chair meetings.[CITATION-17] While it is difficult to identify their origins precisely, signed requests for public meetings of a county or settlement appeared with increasing frequency in the final decades of the eighteenth century. As early as 1775 \u2018Some freeholders\u2019, unnamed, inserted in thethe text of their request to the sheriff.[CITATION-18] In 1778of Dublin sometimes reprinted the signatories of requests to the city or county sheriffs to call meetings, listing names as it did for subscriptions or declarations.[CITATION-19] The Irish Volunteer movement, which emerged in 1778 to police agrarian protest and demand their parliament\u2019s independence from Westminster, occasionally used signed requisitions.[CITATION-20] One Dubliner condemned \u2018the daring and unprecedented measure of freemen and freeholders summoning a meeting of themselves\u2019, rather than relying on the sheriffs and justices to do so, as \u2018an outrage on the constitution\u2019.[CITATION-21] Written requests for public meetings to express a community\u2019s judgement, rather than to elect extra-parliamentary representatives, would remain commonplace throughout Ireland\u2019s constitutional and economic controversies of 1785.[CITATION-22] Although newspaper reporting confirms the use of requisitions across Ireland and Great Britain by 1780, it is hard to know whether the practice proliferated or press coverage of it increased. Certainly, an expanding provincial press in the later eighteenth century encouraged a positive feedback loop, with newspapers printing signed requisitions and other advertisements for public meetings, covering controversies about them, and establishing a \u2018civic Hansard\u2019 of local deliberations.[CITATION-23] Many of Christopher Wyvill\u2019s allies, seeking political and economic reform, publicly requisitioned officials in 1780 for English county meeting to launch their petitions.[CITATION-24] The duke of Richmond shared with the press the correspondence surrounding the rejection of his requisition for a Sussex reform meeting in 1780. The magnate\u2019s insistence that \u2018any gentleman of property and character is of equal authority\u2019 to a sheriff in summoning the county demonstrates how public requisitions might contest, rather than concede, official control over whether \u2018the people have a right to assemble themselves and deliberate on public affairs whenever they think proper\u2019.[CITATION-25] Such rhetoric echoed the New Englanders\u2019 defence of the statutory rights of propertied New Englanders to request notices and warrants for general meetings of their township, even where select-men refused to do so.[CITATION-26] After nearly 200 inhabitants signed petitions requesting a Boston town meeting, the Massachusetts Government Act of 1774 complained that \u2018a great abuse has been made of the power of calling\u2019 such meetings on \u2018matters of general concern\u2019, and required Crown permission for any \u2018called by the select men, or at the request of any number of freeholders\u2019.[CITATION-27] The American defence of community self-government against Crown control probably offered a further source of inspiration for written, signed requests to convene public meetings of a county or town in the British Isles.[CITATION-28] Meetings claiming to represent a locality had far older origins, of course. Gatherings of the gentry and nobility to deliberate and petition on behalf of a \u2018county community\u2019 stretched back to at least the thirteenth century in England and played an important part in the crises of the seventeenth century, when they were often tied to county meetings of the quarter sessions and to grand juries.[CITATION-29] In episodes of popular contention, notably in the \u2018Covenanted public politics\u2019 of Scotland, popular meetings of women and unpropertied men spoke for their communities outside the control and sanction of authorities.[CITATION-30] Both of Charles II\u2019s parliaments subsequently acted against \u2018Tumults and Disorders, upon Pretence of preparing or presenting publick Petitions, or other Addresses\u2019, as the English Act of 1661 characterised them; it demanded the approval of three justices or the majority of a grand jury for organising any petition with more than twenty signatories.[CITATION-31] The king in 1679 could dismiss a petition that lacked official approval as representing merely \u2018a Company of loose disaffected People\u2019, rather than the deliberations of a community.[CITATION-32] While the Bill of Rights of 1689 guaranteed the right to petition the Crown and implied freedoms to assemble and deliberate on such petitions, it left unclear the standing of the 1661 Act.[CITATION-33] Seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century chroniclers mocked petitions or declarations as \u2018surreptitiously obtain\u2019d\u2019 by the pretence that \u2018the Sense of a County lies in a High Sheriff and a Grand Jury\u2019 since \u2018the Court makes the one and the Sheriff the other\u2019.[CITATION-34] By 1769, the endorsement of an \u2018address agreed to and signed, in the name of the Freeholders\u2019 of Surrey as part of the thinly attended \u2018business of the Assize\u2019 evoked complaints that \u2018public notice should have been given\u2019 for a separate meeting to consider this.[CITATION-35] Contests over how to authorise the declarations of a county or settlement only intensified during a distinct series of disputes between government loyalists and their critics in the decade or so after 1769.[CITATION-36] During the controversy over John Wilkes\u2019s election for Middlesex, the sheriffs of Derbyshire and Yorkshire advertised county meetings at the instigation\u2014apparently private, rather than published\u2014of \u2018Many Gentlemen\u2019, while the foreman of the Buckinghamshire grand jury organised one despite his request being refused by the sheriff of that county.[CITATION-37] Both Wilkesites and loyalists accused each other\u2019s meetings of \u2018Spurious and Mock Addresses\u2019, pointing to the presence or absence of officials and leading families in a town\u2019s deliberations.[CITATION-38] During the crisis over the American colonies, both sides seized upon any evidence of a \u2018surreptitiously introduced\u2019 address[CITATION-39] purporting to represent a community \u2018without any previous Notice being given by Public Advertisement, or Public Meeting convened for such Purpose\u2019.[CITATION-40] Closed meetings, such as those of corporations or grand juries, could be challenged as unrepresentative of the \u2018sense of society\u2019 by public meetings,[CITATION-41] whether these were called by officials in response to \u2018the Request of many respectable gentlemen\u2019 or \u2018by public advertisement\u2019 from partisans themselves.[CITATION-42] In 1775, loyalists in Lancashire suggested that the circulation of an anti-ministerial petition represented \u2018the most impudent Usurpation that ever was attempted in Contradiction to the Sense of the County, almost unanimously declared at a publick Meeting\u2019 they had convened in Lancaster.[CITATION-43] Squabbles over the status of so many addresses, petitions, and resolutions emerging from growing numbers of rival meetings explain why written requests for official sanction multiplied in the later eighteenth century.[CITATION-44] Of course, at no point did meetings called by requisitions to office-holders, or after their refusal, provide the only means of political expression under the law. Men and women of all ranks represented their private interests in meetings, lobbies, and parliamentary petitions concerning their property or trade or role in local improvement schemes.[CITATION-45] Philip Loft identifies \u2018multiple layers to the political nation\u2019 throughout the eighteenth century, as \u2018the legitimate participants differed from issue to issue\u2019, and these issues were raised in petitions responding to particular legislation and interests. The same could apply to private meetings of interested parties, but did not customarily translate into county meetings, where active participation was reserved for freeholders, or town meetings, which were restricted to \u2018leading citizens\u2019, whose wealth qualified them to claim to speak for their community.[CITATION-46] However, where an area was deeply entangled in a particular trade, representation of an industry\u2019s interests might be blurred with claims to speak for a territorial community. Indeed, Henry Jephson\u2019s Victorian study of popular assemblies located his \u2018earliest example\u2019 in petitioning over the Cider Tax in 1763, which involved not just the owners of orchards or taverns, but also mass meetings that spread across counties with strong traditions of brewing\u2014and imbibing\u2014the beverage.[CITATION-47] Throughout the eighteenth century, growing numbers of private societies, clubs, and associations, including those specifically for women, could establish their own membership, speakers, and procedures in meetings that might reflect the populace more faithfully than the property-owners voting at the general meetings of a county or town.[CITATION-48] However, local officials and magistrates applied their own prejudices to judging the number, class, and purpose of people whose assembly might warrant threats of prosecution or violent dispersal. Scholars have long studied the politics of \u2018the mob\u2019, as it might be pejoratively dismissed, and how the Riot Act might be invoked or threatened against disorderly crowds.[CITATION-49] After a Fakenham farmer informally agreed to meet some of his struggling employees on market day in 1778, he denounced as \u2018contrary to law\u2019 the appearance of three or four hundred other labourers joining to discuss the affordability of food on their wages.[CITATION-50] Even when headed by the noble Lord George Gordon, the anti-Catholic petitioning campaign of 1780 led to a riotous march on Westminster, which Lord Mansfield judged as violating \u2018principles more ancient and more important than any regulations upon the subject of petitioning\u2019 in menacing Parliament.[CITATION-51] Meanwhile, where radicals aspired to preside over societies or associations with \u2018members unlimited\u2019, private gatherings remained open to accusations of treasonous conspiracy.[CITATION-52] By contrast, proceedings undertaken as\u2014or modelled on\u2014county or town general meetings offered agitators a form of orderly assembly not necessarily judged to be riotous.Therefore, the spread of written requisitions for meetings signalled the evasion, as well as a new exertion, of elite control over public meetings. The second and third sections of this article will trace the dynamics of regulation and exploitation, but it is instructive to assess how requisitioning adapted to the changing forms of public meetings and ultimately faded from the front line of local conflicts. If written requisitions reflected greater pressure on officials to call public meetings, debates continued from the 1780s to the 1830s over when a town meeting could be \u2018\u2019 by \u2018the requisition of private individuals\u2019.[CITATION-53] In counties, disputes proliferated over whether a \u2018meeting is not less a County Meeting because not called by a person appointed by the Crown\u2019.[CITATION-54] Moreover, requisitions took on new functions and purposes in changing legal and political environments, with the term extended to any signed announcement of a meeting. In Ireland, requisitions to Catholic leaders from their own propertied supporters provided public notice of \u2018aggregate meetings\u2019.[CITATION-55] This probably emerged from Dubliners\u2019 earlier practice of requisitioning civic aggregate meetings of both city freemen and county freeholders.[CITATION-56] After the Napoleonic Wars, English radicals used rejections of their requisitions as evidence of establishment corruption and as publicity for their own invitations to mass platform meetings.[CITATION-57] More than two decades later, Radicals and Chartists might submit requisitions to office-holders even as they fused the deliberative procedures of county and town meetings with the scale and openness of Methodist camp meetings.[CITATION-58] In 1838, George Mart pointed to an advertising placard as \u2018the requisition which called you together\u2019 for his open-air meeting in the Potteries.[CITATION-59] By this period, organisations might seek public meetings to consecrate the foundation of \u2018a mere private club\u2019, and the term \u2018public meeting\u2019 extended to events with no pretence of deliberation.[CITATION-60] Multiplying forms of community organisation and the growing use of door-to-door canvassing for petitions diluted the primacy of public meetings in deliberating on behalf of a locality by the 1840s.[CITATION-61] Signed requisitions consequently faded from the front line of battles over the authority of particular assemblies. A requisition for an aggregate meeting of Irish Catholics in 1851 collated hundreds of names, more as a declaration of support for Rome\u2019s restoration of episcopates than as a prompt for the event itself.[CITATION-62] Requisitions could still prove attractive when office-holders themselves wished to claim local support for a cause, as when the mayor of Liverpool organised \u2018one of the longest and most influential requisitions ever got up\u2019 to call a public meeting to protest the same \u2018papal outrages\u2019.[CITATION-63] The value of official meetings to local elites, then, outlasted the rise and fall of signed requisitioning as a front-line tactic in contests over who might claim to represent their community. Indeed, requisitioning survived in the internal rulebooks of local government as a means for elected representatives to call meetings of a council absent the chair\u2019s initiative, and it was reborn in permissive legislation empowering rate-payer democracy for public services.[CITATION-64] However, as the next section demonstrates, struggles over requisitioning left imprints on the legal and political culture of the United Kingdom that outlasted the practice itself.This section compares the political and legislative developments in Ireland and Great Britain that gave new meanings to requisitioning; then, it considers the distinct elements of local discretion in officials accepting a request and magistrates acting against a meeting; and, lastly, considers how far requisitions succeeded in controlling\u2014or legitimising\u2014the expansion of popular politics. Crucially, parliamentary legislation and government repression depended on local interpretation and enforcement. The Riot Act, passed in 1714 for Great Britain and adopted by the Irish Parliament in 1787, indemnified magisterial force for actions taken to suppress disorder, even if it provided no powers for preventing peaceful assembly.[CITATION-65] Ministers relied on the local landowning elite to read the Riot Act and prosecute treason, at least in Great Britain. Before and after the Act of Union, Dublin Castle exercised greater central control over public meetings in Ireland.[CITATION-66] For example, in October 1784, James Napper Tandy organised \u2018requisitions to Ireland\u2019s sheriffs, calling on them to summon their bailiwicks for the purpose of electing representatives\u2019 to a convention. The Attorney General of Ireland swiftly warned office-holders that \u2018summoning the freeholders and freemen to meet for such a purpose\u2019 would be \u2018highly criminal\u2019, and turned up personally to browbeat the sole compliant sheriff into cancelling the meeting as it assembled.[CITATION-67] When, in 1797, an English newspaper criticised the Lord Lieutenant\u2019s warning to requisitionists in Cork against \u2018meeting in unusual numbers,\u2019 as \u2018military coercion\u2019 and a violation of the \u2018inherent right of the subject, allowed by the constitution, and ratified at the revolution in 1688\u2019, it demonstrated ignorance of the uncertain status of the Bill of Rights in Ireland.[CITATION-68] The Dublin and, later, Westminster parliaments readily passed legislation with specific restrictions on public assembly in Ireland. In 1793, a Convention Act against \u2018the Election or Appointment of unlawful Assemblies, under Pretence of preparing or presenting public Petitions, or other Addresses\u2019 attempted to address the Catholic Committee\u2019s or United Irishmen\u2019s emulation of the Volunteer tradition.[CITATION-69] After magistrates disrupted the 1811 meeting of the Catholic Committee in Dublin, it took all of Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s lawyerly skill to ensure that \u2018the wording of the requisition be strictly warrantable under the provisions of the Convention Act\u2019 for \u2018an aggregate Meeting\u2019 advertised with 300 signatories. Such gatherings of Catholics and, later, nationalists explicitly disavowed the \u2018private invitation\u2019 of select audiences in order to demonstrate their lawfulness publicly; the term \u2018aggregate\u2019 became closely associated with Irish meetings of this kind.[CITATION-70] A series of emergency laws, from 1814 onwards, gave the Lords Lieutenant of Ireland further discretion to suspend public assembly in disturbed areas. From 1823, the Catholic Association\u2019s use of rent-paying membership and church structures evaded the existing laws on public meetings and led to a specific statute against \u2018unlawful societies in Ireland\u2019 in 1825. This proscribed Irish associations that sought to change the law and so renewed requisitioning of meetings as separate from charitable fundraising.[CITATION-71] Following Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of the Union repeal movement, the Acts of 1831 and 1833 against Tumultuous Risings and Disturbances provided further power to forbid meetings, including those convened to petition Parliament. The creation of a national constabulary in 1836 and the appointment of resident magistrates in place of local elites further distanced the situation in Ireland from the voluntarist, common-law approach to public meetings in Great Britain.[CITATION-72] These emergency measures and exceptions from localist practices subsequently offered a precedent for policing public assembly in the Empire.[CITATION-73] The Irish legislation, beginning with the 1793 Act, did not augur a parallel approach for the rest of the United Kingdom, contrary to British radicals\u2019 expectations.[CITATION-74] While Pitt\u2019s ministers encouraged prosecutions against seditious speech and suspended, they also sought to strengthen local control over those \u2018public meetings\u2019 held \u2018in the open air\u2019 and to license indoor venues.[CITATION-75] The Seditious Meetings Act of 1795 confirmed the privileges of all official meetings, placing new importance on whether and when an office-holder might agree to call one. Any other meetings of more than fifty people required a requisition signed by at least seven householders, in the form of a public advertisement or notice no less than five days in advance. This permitted local justices to forbid, reschedule, or even disperse meetings with a new proclamation and indemnity to enforce it violently.[CITATION-76] Although distinct, these two elements of local control could often become intermingled in controversial cases. The same individual might serve both as an office-holder deciding whether to agree the requisition for an official meeting and as one of those magistrates who could interpose if it proceeded by independent advertisement. The term \u2018requisition\u2019 was colloquially applied to both subscriptional forms\u2014of requests to office-holders and signed advertisements\u2014even if it was never mentioned in the Act. The Tories promoted the law, paradoxically, as both mere restatement of theand emergency powers essential to avert revolution. Lord Thurlow defended \u2018the glory of English law that there was no previous restraint on the people in the exercise of the important privilege of meeting to discuss grievances and petition Parliament\u2019, adding the sophistry that freedom was \u2018unrestrained, but its abuse was open to punishment\u2019.[CITATION-77] The practical intent and effect was to encourage local repression of perceived \u2018abuse\u2019 and deter mass audiences throughout the wars with France. The initial law expired in 1799, with short revivals and other repressive measures from Westminster used to encourage provincial vigilance.[CITATION-78] Local elites generally acted on ministerial prompts to interpret their powers more repressively in periods of revolutionary fear. Radicals and reformers did convene some public meetings in the later years of the war, including one supported by a requisition signed by 2,000 or more Mancunians in 1808.[CITATION-79] Building on these precedents, growing numbers of radical meetings \u2018combined demonstrations of strength with a commitment to order\u2019 after 1815. The Tories responded with a new Seditious Meetings Act in 1817 for Great Britain and in 1819 for the United Kingdom.[CITATION-80] Both laws again sought to reinforce local office-holders\u2019 confidence in forbidding and dispersing subversive gatherings, without trespassing on respectable meetings of local communities. The first bill revived until July 1818 the strict controls on how legal meetings could be called, adding provisions about adjourning meetings. The second revival was broader in scope, abandoning efforts to define matters of \u2018church or state\u2019 as distinct from others, and seeking to prevent non-residents from attending local meetings.[CITATION-81] In the period between the operation of either act, however, the Peterloo massacre provided sober proof of the legal and military powers available to magistrates regardless. Manchester radicals sought to demonstrate the legality of their rally, scrapping their original requisition because it suggested that they might trespass on parliamentary privileges. The staff of theprepared a fresh requisition, and a thousand householders swiftly \u2018placed on record their honourable Names\u2019 for a public meeting. The newspaper eagerly contrasted the \u2018honest hands\u2019 of these requisitionists with those \u2018pimps of authority\u2019 who had been \u2018begging for Signatures\u2019 for their requisitions from \u2018the dependent and alarmed minions of Power\u2019 and \u2018servile Publicans\u2019. While officials, predictably, declined the request to convene the radical meeting, the careful framing of the requisition posed a legal challenge to any magistrates wishing to prevent it from proceeding, not least as it far exceeded the requirements of the lapsed Seditious Meetings Act.[CITATION-82] Magistrates requested Home Office advice in advance on how and when they could declare the meeting riotous; when their actions killed eighteen and injured hundreds more of the gathered crowd, national debate and criminal prosecutions focused on the lawfulness of the magistrates reading the Riot Act.[CITATION-83] Indeed,justifications of the Peterloo Massacre culminated in the judicial and ministerial fabrication of \u2018seditious assembly\u2019 as a novel concept in common law; as Michael Lobban has shown, this held that the character of a meeting, not what was said or done at it, could be sufficient to make it unlawful and its violent dispersal lawful.[CITATION-84] This further strengthened the discretionary power of Britain\u2019s magistrates against meetings, regardless of any statute in operation.The 1819 Act, passed after Peterloo and in force until 1825, revived controversies over how officials ought to judge requisitions for official meetings that would enjoy particular protections. The Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, insisted that full discretion \u2018undoubtedly belonged\u2019 to officials as to when to grant requests.[CITATION-85] By contrast, Lord Ossulton theorised that traditionally \u2018the sanction of the Sheriff was only necessary to give an authentic character to the meeting, as a meeting of the county\u2019. Under a Seditious Meetings Act, he thought, \u2018private opinions\u2019 should be set aside and officials simply assess if \u2018the requisitions are of sufficient weight and respectability\u2019 or \u2018whether such a meeting, under circumstances possible no doubt, but it is to be presumed rare, may be calculated to produce direct and manifest danger to the public peace\u2019.[CITATION-86] Such logic demonstrates how Whig criticism of the Tories often conflated the refusal to call a meeting officially with the outright prohibition of one.[CITATION-87] Objections to Crown influence over local decisions obscured how far opposition politicians broadly agreed with the Tories that while \u2018the right of meeting was a valuable part of the constitution\u2019 there were \u2018limits within which it should be confined\u2019.[CITATION-88] When Castlereagh dismissed Earl Fitzwilliam as the Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire\u2019s West Riding, George Lamb seized on this as an example of reprisal against those officials who acted \u2018against the wishes of his majesty\u2019s ministers at public meetings\u2019.[CITATION-89] While a clever partisan attack, this overstated the power, rather than influence, ministers wielded. Fitzwilliam was dismissed from his Crown appointment for signing a requisition for a county meeting to discuss the Peterloo massacre. The High Sheriff of Yorkshire, who agreed to the requisition and presided at \u2018the first county meeting which had been disgraced with all the emblems of flags and drums\u2019, remained in post after telling thousands gathered at York Castle that he had \u2018called the meeting readily as he was a friend to popular meetings\u2019. Even if the infamous dismissal demonstrated Crown influence over the Lords Lieutenant, then, numerous sheriffs, mayors, and magistrates could not be so easily replaced.[CITATION-90] Widespread agitation over George IV\u2019s efforts to divorce Queen Caroline tested the local application of the 1819 Seditious Meetings Act. In Cheshire, a \u2018pocket sheriff\u2019 faced claims that his refusal of a requisition placed him in contempt of Parliament for impairing the liberty of petitioning under the Bills of Rights.[CITATION-91] On the basis that he had already procured 9,000 signatures for a declaration favouring the king, the loyalist deputy sheriff of Hampshire rejected a requisition.[CITATION-92] In Northumberland, Sir Charles Monck published his correspondence with the sheriff, objecting to the lack of \u2018some constitutional ground for such refusal\u2019 of a requisition for a meeting. Yet, even under the provisions of the 1819 Act, office-holders were unable to impose \u2018conformity to the wishes of the Ministers of the day\u2019 by applying their own prejudices to requests. Monck\u2019s fellow Whigs in the county subsequently repurposed their requisition as a signed advertisement for their own \u2018meeting of the independent freeholders, and inhabitants\u2019. They could safely proceed on their own authority since the requisition included an array of local magnates and gentry, not just seven householders, and a number were themselves magistrates tasked with monitoring such notices.[CITATION-93] For those not so elevated as to be justices of the peace themselves, the discretion of officials had long provided obstructions and sometimes opportunities. The overlapping jurisdiction of officials allowed some requisitionists to choose the most receptive recipient. In 1810, the grand jury of Dublin and a group of 124 freemen and freeholders sent requisitions to both the High Sheriffs of the county and the city, asking them to convene a meeting to consider repeal of the Act of Union. The dual strategy was astute, since one sheriff ignored them, but the other agreed.[CITATION-94] Similarly, in 1839, the deputy constable of Clifford, in West Yorkshire, agreed to convene a meeting to remonstrate against the high level of postal charges even though the head constable had declined a requisition from local tradesmen.[CITATION-95] In some cases, requisitions and counter-requisitions engaged in a contest of signature-gathering to persuade an official to agree or to refuse to call a public meeting, as in 1809, when accusations of wartime corruption prompted Prestonians to sign rival demands to the mayor.[CITATION-96] Officials\u2019 sympathies might influence how they assayed the weight of signatures. In 1830, the sheriff of Cornwall refused to call a meeting about reform, claiming a lack of clergy or wealthy men among the 300 freeholders signing the requisition.[CITATION-97] In 1838, the bailiff of Darlington refused to call a public meeting about the repeal of the Corn Laws, arguing that \u2018the requisition was not respectably signed\u2019 as \u2018several of the requisitionists rent shops and premises in the central part of the town\u2019 but few were freeholders.[CITATION-98] By contrast, the constable of Brighton insisted that he was obliged to agree a requisition from rate-payers, regardless of whether they included \u2018the poorest or the richest men\u2019.[CITATION-99] Given the prevalence of absentee landownership in Ireland, any test of requisitionists\u2019 \u2018great property\u2019 became an excuse to refuse county meetings.[CITATION-100] As late 1839, the High Sheriff of Queens County rejected a requisition from \u2018Popish priests\u2019 on the grounds that it lacked \u2018resident landed proprietors\u2019 among the signatories.[CITATION-101] The decisions of officials, then, reflected different national and local contexts, ranging from counties down to parishes, and reflecting grander and humbler office-holders\u2019 connections to their communities.Where a meeting proceeded without an official convening it, it was subject to magisterial veto during the operation of the Seditious Meetings Act and common-law threat of violent dispersal and criminal prosecution at all times. Immediately after Peterloo, Sir Codrington Carrington, a past Chief Justice of Ceylon and the current chairman of the Buckinghamshire Quarter Sessions, published a tract denying \u2018the birth-right of the subjects of Great Britain to assemble at the requisition of any private individual\u2019. He distinguished \u2018the regulated privilege of petition\u2019 in the Bill of Rights from unlawful assemblies \u2018for the purpose of deliberating upon any alleged grievance in Church or State, unsanctioned by the concurrence or summons of the appropriate public authority, but originating in the will of any number of mere private persons\u2019.[CITATION-102] Many Tory politicians may have agreed, but legislation always permitted householders to requisition public meetings through signed advertisements, subject to the oversight of magistrates\u2014whether those like Codrington or more permissive individuals. When, in Leeds and Plymouth, the mayor refused a requisition from householders for a meeting to petition in support of Queen Caroline, it became their own signed advertisement for a meeting unmolested by the magistrates.[CITATION-103] In 1817, Lord Grenville presciently worried whether magistrates could now \u2018legalize notices, which would otherwise be illegal\u2019 by exercising their discretion not to act against a signed advertisement.[CITATION-104] The 1819 law included a clause attempting to guard against this, but formalising the notification of magistrates could sometimes assure those organising and attending meetings of their lawfulness\u2014even if a requisition had not protected the Peterloo crowd from the Riot Act.[CITATION-105] Indeed, long after the expiry of the final Seditious Meetings Act in 1825, its procedures for requisitioning shaped popular views of the constitutional standing of public assembly. In 1839, thecounselled readers that to \u2018make any public meeting legal it is only necessary that a requisition, signed by seven householders, be presented to the Mayor or Chief Constable of a Town or Borough, or to the Lord Lieutenant for a County Meeting\u2019, but then \u2018if he decline, the requisitionists may call the meeting themselves\u2019.[CITATION-106] In York, Chartists sent \u2018a numerously signed requisition of respectable tradesmen\u2019 to the Mansion House, but since the Lord Mayor was out of town\u2014perhaps not coincidentally\u2014\u2018the requisitionists were compelled to call the meeting\u2019 outside the Albion Hotel themselves.[CITATION-107] If this trick played on the Government\u2019s \u2018scrupulous anxiety to keep within the Law in dealing with Chartism\u2019, it should not be mistaken as \u2018a misunderstanding\u2019 of that law, as F.C. Mather suggests.[CITATION-108] Rather, Chartists identified ways to tame the threat of repression by local magistrates, whether by assuaging anxieties or delegitimising any reaction.[CITATION-109] The formula permitted some meetings to proceed even after the royal proclamation of 1839 encouraged magistrates to prevent revolutionary threats.[CITATION-110] In Northallerton, one justice declined a requisition to convene a meeting himself but gave the Chartists his blessing to proceed, \u2018wishing the speakers only not to use inflammatory language\u2019.[CITATION-111] Where local magistrates did forbid an advertised public meeting from proceeding, organisers could evade their jurisdiction in remote moors and open fields, even if this involved serious hikes for the audience and scheduling for weekends or holidays rather than workday evenings.[CITATION-112] Hence, in 1840, the Chartists of Stockton-upon-Tees assembled at Thornaby Green, two miles outside the bounds of their town, after the mayor not only refused to call a meeting in compliance with a requisition \u2018signed by the number of inhabitant householders specified by Act of Parliament\u2019 but also threatened to set the special constables upon them.[CITATION-113] In emphasising the contingency of local repression and subversive uses for the law, we should not ignore the physical peril for attendees of more radical public meetings. Inconsistent or tardy responses from local officials could create rather than remove physical and legal jeopardy, as two examples from Newcastle-upon-Tyne demonstrate. In 1819, the mayor declined a requisition from 300 inhabitants to convene a meeting about Peterloo, but \u2018gave permission to proceed with the meeting, which he promised not to molest\u2019 as he trusted \u2018the good sense and prudence of the people\u2019. The reformers subsequently offered him a vote of thanks, but the mayor \u2018caught the contagion of fear\u2019 in the following days and turned against a brewing \u2018rebellion\u2019, resulting in violent clashes.[CITATION-114] Twenty years later, the town\u2019s magistrates responded to a riot by forbidding all public meetings. The town\u2019s Chartists therefore submitted a requisition to the mayor for permission to meet at the end of the month to deliberate over sending an address to the Queen against a standing army and the proposed rural police bill. John Fife, the mayor and an active member of the Northern Political Union just a few years earlier, did not respond until the last moment\u2014and then with his refusal. Attendees gathered at the public grounds known as the Forth, but local officials read the Riot Act and deployed armed troops and constables to disperse the outraged crowd. While no one died, a generation would remember that the 1839 \u2018Battle of the Forth was the Peterloo of Newcastle\u2019 and R.C. Gammage quickly accused Fife of trying \u2018to strike a blow at the right of public meeting\u2019.[CITATION-115] As both these examples demonstrate\u2014in periods outside any Seditious Meetings Act\u2014indecision and bad faith by local officials remained a threat to, as well as an opportunity for, those requisitioning and attending public meetings.[CITATION-116] Since magistrates retained arbitrary discretion in declaring assemblies riotous or seditious, they could threaten violence or prosecution obliquely with well-timed reminders in response to the open advertisement of public meetings. William Cobbett suspected many attendees chose not to attend his petition meeting at Portsdown Hill, Hampshire, after this happened in February 1817.[CITATION-117] Huddersfield\u2019s magistrates, \u2018not content with throwing every legal and constitutional obstacle in the way of the requisitions\u2019 for public meetings in 1839, offered \u2018a little intimidation\u2019 in vague but menacing posters around the town.[CITATION-118] The authorities could also use the names on a requisition or signed advertisement to persecute organisers and supporters.[CITATION-119] In Yorkshire, \u2018the Court party\u2019 formed a \u2018Gag Committee\u2019 that scuppered an 1817 meeting on reform by persuading sufficient of the eighty signatories to withdraw their names from a requisition to the sheriff.[CITATION-120] The constables of Barnsley accepted a Chartist requisition for consideration but then retained it, apparently with an eye to arresting the signatories or at least threatening to do so.[CITATION-121] At a Halifax public meeting to condemn the Peterloo massacre, the reported crowd of 40,000 stampeded in panic at false rumours that the constables\u2014whose refusal had led to the gathering being convened by the requisitionists\u2014had come to attack it; only assurance of the presence of a sympathetic magistrate allayed the panic.[CITATION-122] Where audiences risked their own personal safety, however, their sheer numbers created a material challenge to dispersal. As a speaker told Rochdale\u2019s Chartists in the summer of 1839, \u2018[t]he Government cannot commit a million and a half men to prison, but they can pick them out here and there, and thus terrify the whole\u2019.[CITATION-123] For this reason, the cumulative choices of meeting attendees constrained the limits of repression, in practice.Ultimately, the protective value of requisitions faded in the face of the common law doctrine of \u2018seditious assembly\u2019, as judges pointed to the scale and perception of meetings, rather than the likely or actual conduct, as determining their legality. In Ireland, Daniel O\u2019Connell faced prosecution in 1842 for the \u2018intimidation intended to be excited\u2019 by the sheer numbers his repeal meetings attracted. Prosecuting Chartists at the Lancashire assizes in 1842, Lord Abinger told the grand jury that meetings attended by \u2018such multitudes as to render all notion of serious debate impossible\u2019 must be intrinsically riotous. Judged against the traditions of deliberative town and county meetings, \u2018assemblies of such magnitude, without a president, or any one empowered and able to restrain and dissolve them, must lead, as every one will see, to alarm and terror, and to the disturbance of the peace\u2019.[CITATION-124] The shift away from official procedure to elite anxiety as a determinant of legality took time to disseminate; later that year, the magistrate\u2019s periodicalanswered a reader\u2019s query about Chartist meetings with the advice that \u2018as long as they conduct themselves peacefully, and use no seditious or inflammatory language, they cannot be legally molested\u2019.[CITATION-125] However, the Home Secretary, Sir George Grey, supported the Metropolitan Police in judging that the procession of the Chartists\u2019 great petition from Kennington Common to Westminster in 1848 was \u2018calculated to inspire just terror and alarm\u2019.[CITATION-126] An 1848 guide for magistrates disseminated this principle of seditious assembly even more widely, shifting further away from the earlier Acts\u2019 emphasis on due notification and advertisement.[CITATION-127] In these ways, the magisterial right of veto gained a more expansive application, since the procedure of requisition had ceased to provide elite control over public meetings. When the threshold for seditious assembly receded along with fears of revolution after 1848 in Great Britain, access to public space became a new frontier for struggles over popular assembly.[CITATION-128] Did the spread of requisitioning strengthen popular claims or state repression, then? Opportunism led political elites to welcome \u2018a general run of addresses\u2019 from their grass-roots supporters when these might be \u2018of great service\u2019 to their cause, fuelling conflicts over the authority of local meetings and so stimulating written requisitions to validate them.[CITATION-129] In 1784, Edmund Burke loftily warned against \u2018a double House of Commons\u2019, with the executive playing off expressions of opinion \u2018in corporation and county meetings dispersed\u2019 against the lawful deliberations of elected members \u2018in Parliament assembled\u2019. While he and other Rockingham Whigs now condemned an outpouring of Tory addresses, they had helped requisition meetings for Wyvill\u2019s reform petitions just a few years earlier.[CITATION-130] In the 1790s, Pittite office-holders might issue or grant requisitions for county or town meetings as part of the \u2018vulgar\u2019 loyalism of defending the king and the constitution.[CITATION-131] When in 1821 the duke of Wellington condemned \u2018the farce of a county meeting\u2019, he recognised theand clarified that his remark referred only to a specific rejection of a requisition in Hampshire, where he was Lord Lieutenant, and that public meetings \u2018if properly regulated, were a fair constitutional mode of taking the sense of the county\u2019.[CITATION-132] Successive special laws for Ireland, a reliance on outsider stipendiary magistrates, and the central military authority commanded from Dublin Castle contrasted with a greater respect for local initiative in Great Britain. There, ministers relied on laws or proclamations to embolden local office-holders\u2019 discretion and magistrates\u2019 enforcement.[CITATION-133] The development of new police forces and stipendiary magistrates did not displace this reliance on the amateur administration of justice, largely thanks to the parsimony of rate-payers.[CITATION-134] While repressive legislation had sought to control novel waves of mass meetings that had left peace officers uncertain, it also codified specific practices that could be adapted and subverted. During the fevered crisis of 1831\u201332, freeholders and liberal magistrates requisitioned the sheriff of Warwickshire to call a county meeting that subsequently condemned the reactionary magistrates and mayor of Warwick, who were responsible for heavy-handed policing.[CITATION-135] The political sympathies and transient fears of local elites shaped how they applied the law to people and events, establishing new traditions. During the Queen Caroline agitation, Birmingham\u2019s Tories had circumvented George Muntz, the High Bailiff, in order to requisition their own town meeting in favour of the king\u2019s divorce. More than a decade later, Muntz enjoyed reading aloud the same names from a protest denigrating a reform meeting not convened by the current office-holders.[CITATION-136] If the liberality and tyranny of particular justices and officials might ebb and flow across Great Britain, new precedents provided high-water marks in subsequent disputes with office-holders.[CITATION-137] The next section shows why so many skirmishes would be fought over the signatures on requisitions.Organising, submitting, and contesting requisitions was just one of the ways in which local \u2018political entrepreneurs\u2019 turned high political issues into truly nation-wide controversies. Like petitions, protests, and other representations of popular opinion, meetings constructed expressions of support as much as revealing some pre-existing balance of sentiments.[CITATION-138] This section considers how requisitioning shaped the organisation, advertisement, attendance, and conduct of meetings, revealing rival claims to represent a community. The representative claim of a meeting began with the signatures on a requisition, which was likely to be reproduced and publicised in an advertisement for a meeting, whether approved by an official or proceeding on the initiative of the requisitionists alone.[CITATION-139] Appealing to both the quantity and quality of support they enjoyed, requisitions often employed a stock boast, also common for petitions, of being \u2018numerously and respectably signed\u2019.[CITATION-140] In fact, over time, inflationary expectations or organisational incentives boosted the number of names attached to requisitions.[CITATION-141] Some grew so large that they became preliminary drafts of a mass petition; in 1820, 100 \u2018respectable citizens\u2019 in Edinburgh and 300 Glaswegians each signed requisitions for anti-ministerial meetings.[CITATION-142] Like other sorts of subscriptional address, the initial audience for each signature on a requisition would be the next person invited to add their name.[CITATION-143] Then, whatever officials and magistrates made of the signatories, their names\u2014often printed on advertisements or read aloud at meetings\u2014might repel or attract the potential audience.[CITATION-144] When Wyvill sought more than 200 Yorkshire freeholders to sign his 1779 requisition for a county meeting on reform, he exercised care to exclude parliamentarians whose support might indicate partisanship. He did, however, secure the support of York\u2019s Dean, whose name could signal to clergy that they too might defy their archbishop\u2019s disapproval of reform.[CITATION-145] By contrast, critics could point out a narrow base of support. During the Reform bill crisis, Lord Wharncliffe recognised that the \u2018gentlemen who had put their names to this requisition were old Parliamentary Reformers\u2019 and hence cast doubt on whether a Yorkshire county meeting and its petition really spoke for \u2018the great body of the freeholders\u2019.[CITATION-146] Canny organisers, in this way, might search for unexpected signatories and aim for a broad church of support in order to prove the significance of their meeting and any resolutions or petitions it might produce.[CITATION-147] Hence, in 1839, the Whig parliamentary agent for Fife recruited local Chartists to join the requisition for a meeting in Markinch\u2019s Apron Society Hall, signalling a popular front to praise Victoria\u2019s defiance of the Tories during the bedchamber crisis.[CITATION-148] Those designing and signing a requisition often assumed a wider set of responsibilities for the meeting too.[CITATION-149] A letter of 1825 from one anti-slavery veteran to a new local committee explained how they should meet privately \u2018for the purpose of drawing up a requisition, framing resolutions of a petition, & arranging the business & settling the part each individual shall take, in a public meeting\u2019.[CITATION-150] Beyond choreography for resultant gatherings, requisitionists might also function as delegated organisers; the resolutions of a meeting commonly delegated the signatories of the requisition to form a committee to co-ordinate the collection of signatures for a petition or address. In 1815 William Cobbett found 581 other freeholders to support his requisition to the High Sheriff of Hampshire for a county meeting, and he hinted at one reason for assembling so many names when he encouraged \u2018one Gentleman from every town, and every considerable village\u2019 to attend, so that \u2018the work of signing Petitions might be very easily and speedily accomplished\u2019 afterwards.[CITATION-151] On a similar model, the Catholic Association treated the requisitionists of local meetings in 1829 as the delegated organisers of the petitioning effort in each part of Ireland.[CITATION-152] Peel\u2019s ministry expressed particular concern over the role that Catholic priests played in requisitioning the meeting of 1843 in Clontarf, as it signalled a wider role for clerical organising in the repeal agitation.[CITATION-153] Whether they signed an original document or approved the use of their name on the advertisement, requisitionists would generally be expected to attend and perhaps to speak at a subsequent public meeting. If absent, well-known figures might send letters to be read on their behalf, excusing their indisposition and endorsing an outcome for the meeting.[CITATION-154] Mass absenteeism could be embarrassing, however. Some organisers resented that \u2018people seemed to fancy they had only to give their names to a public measure, and then all their duty was done\u2019, while critics pointed to poor turnouts as proof that a requisition\u2019s \u2018signatures were obtained of tradesmen and others\u2019 obliged to \u2018their patrons\u2019 but not committed to the cause.[CITATION-155] In 1839, the Provost of Maxwelltown tried to delay starting a meeting on the Corn Laws until the requisitionists had all arrived. While he may have hoped to alter the balance of forces attending the meeting, he drew complaints that working men could not waste time waiting, with the Chartist Thomas Johnston asking: \u2018[a]re the men of Maxwelltown dogs, that they should come crouching when you and your brother rulers choose to whistle on them?\u2019[CITATION-156] In such cases, poor turnout on the part of the requisitionists undermined any advantage from securing a friendly official in the chair.A male householder adding his name to a requisition made a public claim on the time and attention of his peers and associated himself with its purpose; like the polling of votes in elections, this was a public act. When, in 1833, an anonymous \u2018Rate Payer\u2019 in Morley signed placards calling a public meeting on church rates, fellow inhabitants assembled instead to denounce \u2018so cowardly a system\u2019 in this \u2018unusual manner adopted of calling public meetings\u2019.[CITATION-157] However, those \u2018more humble in their origins\u2019 who wished to initiate meetings could openly challenge propertied signatories\u2019 aloofness in not requisitioning meetings of concern to their community.[CITATION-158] At an 1837 meeting against the new poor law in Dewsbury, one speaker was \u2018angry that the shopkeepers have shrunk from this meeting\u2019 and \u2018that a sufficient number of them could not be found to sign a requisition\u2019 for official sanction. In the wake of the Reform Act, this was a further example of privileges that \u2018they appear desirous of keeping them to themselves\u2019.[CITATION-159] By contrast, the following year, when Earl Fitzwilliam claimed that the workers of the West Riding had come to embrace the benefits of the poor law, Richard Oastler theatrically suggested that he sign a requisition to the Lord Lieutenant for a county meeting on the question. This was not just a pointed allusion to Fitzwilliam\u2019s dismissal from that office twenty years earlier; it was a clever subversion of leading property-holders\u2019 traditional prerogatives, challenging his reluctance to test workers\u2019 opinions openly.[CITATION-160] Traditionally, organisers had limited powers to procure predetermined decisions as the very authority of a town or county meeting depended on its claim to open deliberation of the matters identified in a requisition.[CITATION-161] This often allowed enemies to hijack an official meeting, subverting the intended outcome. In 1800, Viscount Castlereagh and John Beresford conspired to demonstrate popular support for the proposed Anglo-Irish Union, hoping for \u2018counter-petitions\u2019 in the face of \u2018a great run of petitions against\u2019. They expected the opposition to request a meeting in Donegal, and Castlereagh judged that \u2018the sheriffs calling it at their instance would be most for our advantage\u2019 as he hoped to send allies to \u2018turn the tables upon them and vote an address in favour\u2019. This \u2018would have an excellent effect\u2014as we don\u2019t call the meeting, we lose nothing if it fails\u2019, Castlereagh observed, providing a glimpse of the private calculations behind requisitioning and ambushes of this kind.[CITATION-162] When Dewsbury\u2019s constable refused to permit amendments during a meeting called to celebrate the Queen\u2019s coronation, radicals on the parish vestry challenged his claims for expenses in publicising the meeting; his conduct converted \u2018a \u201c\u201d into a \u201c\u201d\u2019, they argued, meaning that he should carry the advertising costs himself.[CITATION-163] At the same time, chairs and organisers could deflect hostile audiences by insisting that a meeting stuck to its requisitioned purpose, beyond which it stretched its mandate or even its legality.[CITATION-164] Hence, in 1797, the sheriff of County Antrim prevented any debate on Catholic Emancipation and parliamentary reform, \u2018not because he personally objected to it, but because it did not make part of the business mentioned in the requisition\u2019 to convene the meeting.[CITATION-165] Meetings convened for constitutional purposes as cover for subversive ones had been a target of legislation from the old law against Tumultuous Petitioning down to the Seditious Meetings Acts. Southwark\u2019s High Bailiff elicited \u2018loud hissing\u2019 when he reminded a meeting of Queen Caroline\u2019s sympathisers of this, alluding to \u2018many severe restrictions against digressing from the particular subject of a requisition\u2019.[CITATION-166] Of course, what constituted digression from the substance of a requisition was itself a question of political judgement. In both 1821 and 1822 partisans requisitioned county meetings in Devon to petition about agricultural distress; on each occasion, the intentional inclusion or exclusion of \u2018the \u201cold Bugbear, Parliamentary reform\u201d\u2019 became a point of discord, as partisans differed on its relevance or irrelevance to their economic situation.[CITATION-167] For decades to come, reformers could connect parliamentary representation to myriad other complaints. In January 1839, the mayor of Leeds agreed to a requisition from the great and the good for an anti-Corn Law meeting at the Court House. Feargus O\u2019Connor successfully amended the resolutions to favour universal male suffrage.[CITATION-168] Perhaps the most skilful manipulation of a meeting embellished, rather than reversed, the requisition\u2019s stated purpose. At a County Dublin meeting in January 1823 in Kilmainham, Daniel O\u2019Connell gleefully adopted loyalist garb in condemning the Orange Order\u2019s \u2018conspiracy\u2019 against the Lord Lieutenant. Since the requisition suggested a loyal address wishing for the viceroy\u2019s recovery from an assassination attempt, he argued that condemnation of protestant violence was wholly within the purview of the meeting.[CITATION-169] Derby\u2019s Chartists, at a town meeting to launch a congratulatory address to the Queen on the birth of her first child in 1842, sought to amend the loyal address to highlight the sufferings of working-class women in childbirth.[CITATION-170] Local supporters of larger causes, then, exploited the practices designed to limit, control, and direct the organisation of public meetings, whether by submitting their own requisitions, by recruiting signatories to expand support, or by ambushing opponents, either physically or procedurally.The representative claims of a public meeting would also be tested against the timely and open notice of it. When the tame sheriff of County Down refused a requisition from critics of the Anglo-Irish Union in 1800, the lack of \u2018public meetings of which due and legal notice had been given\u2019 provided easy ammunition to mock \u2018surreptitious addresses\u2019, such as that emerging from a grand jury he had stacked.[CITATION-171] Equally, those \u2018quietly\u2019 circulating requisitions for a public meeting would be hoping to select the audience too.[CITATION-172] In 1822, Henry Hunt mocked the sheriff of Somerset for printing the requisition for a county meeting only \u2018in ancorner of an\u2019, identifying a deliberate Whig plan to gather for a \u2018nice, snug humbug of their own\u2019.[CITATION-173] In 1839 Gateshead\u2019s radicals mocked this sort of \u2018hole and corner meeting\u2019, which might not be announced \u2018til the afternoon\u2019 when only \u2018a few placards\u2019 conveyed that the mayor had accepted \u2018a requisition got up by the Whigs\u2019 in favour of impressment of seamen and tax cuts for shipowners.[CITATION-174] In some cases, critics could help advertise a requisitioned meeting they suspected of deliberately limited publicity. After the mayor of Newcastle granted a \u2018most numerously and respectably signed\u2019 requisition from advocates of Catholic emancipation in 1829, those fearing \u2018the utter subversion of the Constitution of 1688\u2019 printed notices warning protestants to \u2018attend and by your votes preserve the blessings so dearly purchased by your Ancestors\u2019.[CITATION-175] Most spectacularly, Manchester\u2019s borough reeve went so far as to cancel a 1812 public meeting in the Exchange Hall after unauthorised advertisements promoted mass attendance in order to prevent any misrepresentation of the town\u2019s views by the loyalists requisitioning the meeting; crowds assembled outside anyway, leading to a riot in which the building was ransacked.[CITATION-176] Where meetings proceeded on private initiative rather than accepted requisition, organisers \u2018were thrown upon their own resources\u2019 in organising a venue and advertising.[CITATION-177] Local printers and bellmen might refuse commissions to publicise meetings where they feared magisterial or social repercussions for doing so.[CITATION-178] In the decades after the Napoleonic Wars, a proliferation of civic buildings offered the chance to requisition a symbol of community authority as well as cover from inclement weather.[CITATION-179] For this reason, as much as office-holders\u2019 presidency and the official status it provided, requisitions increasingly sought permission to use these spaces. Bath\u2019s Council refused the use of the town hall for a Chartist women\u2019s meeting in 1838, despite protests that \u2018the Requisition requesting the use of the Hall was more numerously and respectably signed than any former requisition to the same\u2019.[CITATION-180] By contrast, Chartists in Nottingham secured the use of their town hall, even if the mayor declined to chair their meetings.[CITATION-181] Just as the largest mass meetings assembled on moors and fields beyond the jurisdiction of hostile authorities, the refusal of access to local buildings might lead organisers to advertise their meeting in an urban open space, such as a marketplace, furthering the association of radicalism with the open air.[CITATION-182] That association also rested on the fact that such meetings, \u2018by being held in the open air, would naturally contain loose and suspicious individuals\u2019. Even before rioting began, the Spa Fields meetings of 1816 appeared transgressive since, as one whiggish detractor noted, the radicals\u2019 placards summoned \u2018exclusively\u2019 the \u2018lower order of the people\u2019 from adjacent London parishes. The resolutions addressed \u2018our fellow-countrymen\u2019 of \u2018every City, Town, and populous place in the United Kingdom\u2019, who were\u2014in the style of a requisition\u2014\u2018hereby invited, and requested by this Meeting to assemble and meet on theday, at the same hour, and for the SAME PURPOSE\u2019 of petitioning for reform themselves.[CITATION-183] As a conservative essayist complained in 1820, \u2018the modern method of calling together large deliberative crowds, as a sort of\u2019, producing resolutions \u2018as authorized expressions of popular opinion\u2019, would, \u2018to our ancestors, have been unintelligible\u2019. While the Seditious Meetings Act could encourage magisterial reaction against mass meetings of this kind, limiting \u2018in some degree the right of voluntary meetings\u2019,[CITATION-184] it did little to arrest a tremulous transition across our period from county communities of magnates and gentry, or urban oligarchies, to public meetings of inhabitants more generally.[CITATION-185] This can be seen in the shifting expectations of who might participate in public meetings called by requisition. The increasingly frequent calls for general meetings of a county assembled large numbers of freeholders, whose property also qualified them to vote in elections of shire MPs.[CITATION-186] While they were denied speaking and voting rights, women and unpropertied men certainly attended county meetings in the 1790s and might be acknowledged as subscribers to funds launched there.[CITATION-187] Since presence did not permit full participation, however, some requisitionists sought to broaden the invitation to a meeting.[CITATION-188] In 1795, the sheriff of Bedfordshire accepted a requisition organised by the duke of Bedford for a county meeting about the proposed Gagging Acts, but in his consequent advertisement replaced the word \u2018inhabitants\u2019 with the more traditional \u2018freeholders\u2019. When the sheriff tried to restrict participation on the day, the gathering split into rival county meetings, denounced by each other as \u2018certain of the inhabitants\u2019 and a \u2018promiscuous assembly\u2019 that \u2018took possession of the town-hall\u2019. The duke defended his broader invitation on the basis that the meeting resolved to send a petition to which \u2018the signature of the poorest individual, who was capable of forming a judgement on the measure, was as respectable as that of the proudest merchant, or the richest banker\u2019.[CITATION-189] Since, for centuries, petitions had sometimes included \u2018inhabitants\u2019, growing numbers of initiatory petitions from public meetings might justify broader invitations.[CITATION-190] Yet the sheriff of Staffordshire, when faced with a similar challenge in 1797, offered the traditional view \u2018that a voice at a County Meeting belongs exclusively to Freeholders, and that to summon the Manufacturers and Inhabitants would be an encroachment on the privileges of the Freeholders\u2019.[CITATION-191] After the Napoleonic Wars, T.B.H. Oldfield complained that \u2018it has been customary for the Sheriff to summon only the freeholders\u2019 to county meetings, \u2018as if every other description of persons, because they are deprived of the right of voting, should be deprived of the right of petitioning also\u2019. As a leading polemicist for parliamentary reform, he recognised a parallel challenge to the representative claims of property.[CITATION-192] Indeed, after the Napoleonic Wars, one editor warned that \u2018including in the Requisitions for County Meetings the mass of the inhabitants was pregnant with dangerous consequences\u2019 precisely because \u2018the Freeholders must be a minority\u2019 and so the sober judgement of property overwhelmed.[CITATION-193] By 1821, official meetings faced challenge as \u2018unjustifiably exclusive\u2019 if they were not open to all inhabitants rather than just freeholders or, in towns, householders. However, the success of challenges turned on local tests of strength, and we should be cautious in affirming \u2018the participation of all inhabitants of the community, irrespective of their gender, or their status\u2019.[CITATION-194] Regardless of how a requisition framed the invitation, one radical in 1808 noted \u2018the inconvenience, trouble, and loss of time to which the middle classes of the people are subject in their attendance\u2019.[CITATION-195] This was as nothing to Thomas Cooper\u2019s recollections that the working pressures of \u2018employment that I might have bread, prevented me from feeling much curiosity about public meetings\u2019 in his early life before the 1840s.[CITATION-196] Where wider numbers of inhabitants did attend, officials struggled to enforce any restrictions of rank and geography they wished to impose. The geographical limits of residence could be tricky to delineate, especially where urban communities abutted. Hence, the mayor of Dudley was challenged \u2018Is not this a Public Meeting?\u2019 when he tried to insist in 1819 that the requisition\u2019s invitation to inhabitants of \u2018the Town and Neighbourhood\u2019 did not extend so far as Birmingham.[CITATION-197] To defend local control, the 1817 and 1819 Seditious Meetings Acts penalised illicit attendance at official meetings and restricted any meeting called on the initiative of householders to the locals of a single parish; however, it did not restrict the classes of property and people invited, even if this presumably informed magisterial prejudices in exercising their powers of veto.[CITATION-198] In practice, growing numbers of propertied men might not recognise each other, and meetings presented few opportunities to validate a man\u2019s qualifications of property or residence. When more than 2,000 men attended a Devon County meeting about reform in 1821, it did not allow for the sorts of scrutiny common to contested elections polled over multiple days.[CITATION-199] This left the audiences for any meeting\u2014who was invited and who actually attended\u2014contingent on local debates over where the boundaries should be drawn and trespassers detected.[CITATION-200] As for female participation in official meetings, Kathryn Gleadle\u2019s characterisation of women as \u2018borderline citizens\u2019 captures participation that remained contingent on context and open to challenge.[CITATION-201] Meetings convened on the requisitionists\u2019 own initiative could invite women to speak or at least have their words read by male orators.[CITATION-202] When, in 1832, Eliza Macauley \u2018deprecated the custom which prevented women from taking part in the public proceedings\u2019, she did so from the platform of a gathering of stakeholders in Robert Owen\u2019s new labour exchange, which resembled a commercial as much as political meeting.[CITATION-203] Women enjoyed greater opportunities to speak and vote in the meetings of parish vestries than in county or town meetings.[CITATION-204] The Queen Caroline controversy, where women\u2019s gender established their interest in her plight, provides evidence of \u2018Ladies\u2019 not only signing their own petitions and addresses but also attending public meetings.[CITATION-205] However, the descriptions of the detached, seated areas for \u2018Married Ladies\u2019 at various London parish gatherings suggest that they would have observed, rather than participated in, any deliberations. It was an exceptional moment when, in Leeds, \u2018the ladies were called to hold up their hands\u2019 to approve the text of a female address after men had affirmed the main resolutions of a meeting.[CITATION-206] The presence of women in the audience of a Norfolk county meeting regarding slavery, in 1825, is only recorded because controversy erupted over whether the speeches provided too much detail of the abuse of the enslaved.[CITATION-207] In 1830, the mayor of York agreed a requisition for an anti-slavery meeting where women vastly outnumbered men in the audience but did not speak.[CITATION-208] The monster meetings of the post-war mass platform and Chartism might have allowed women to take part in votes on resolutions in ways official meetings did not.[CITATION-209] By the 1830s, the campaigns against the New Poor Law and for the Charter did organise \u2018public meetings\u2019 of women as separate events with female chairs and speakers, perhaps following requisitions seeking access to a public building.[CITATION-210] However, \u2018public meetings of ladies\u2019, specifically, remained rare and often confined to specific charitable causes into the 1840s. This reflected the extension of the term \u2018public meeting\u2019 as much as women\u2019s entry into the traditional assemblies of propertied men.[CITATION-211] Expectations of broader participation gradually blended the declarative and deliberative gatherings of a locality with the rallies, lectures, and \u2018public meetings\u2019 of interested stakeholders and voluntary associations.[CITATION-212] Thomas Attwood tried to launch his Political Union for parliamentary reform with a requisition signed by hundreds of Birmingham\u2019s inhabitants in 1830; when the High Bailiff refused on the grounds of the impropriety of calling a municipal meeting to form a pressure group, the requisitionists convened one in their own names.[CITATION-213] If this sought to add civic authority to a membership organisation, not all associations welcomed the deliberative procedures expected for community gathering. An 1827 Liverpool \u2018public meeting\u2019 of \u2018friends\u2019 of the Irish Sunday School Society was \u2018public\u2019 in accessibility and advertisement while denying critics the right to speak or amend its resolutions.[CITATION-214] In 1832, Mancunians argued over the alleged \u2018pretence of a public meeting\u2019 by protestant critics of the Irish National Schools, given that the event was \u2018publicly convened, with the boroughreeve announced as the chairman\u2019 and yet sold tickets to control a \u2018packed meeting\u2019.[CITATION-215] The introduction of ticketing in these cases reflected the hybridisation of \u2018public meetings\u2019, asserting representative claims for an association that might have previously met privately. The growing use of partisan meetings in the 1830s, with pre-determined resolutions even when open to popular attendance, was more an admission of defeat in defending the propertied privileges of official meetings than the \u2018closure\u2019 of a genuinely democratic tradition. The many local incidents where one group quit a meeting they proved unable to carry were writ large in the diminished salience of official meetings and requisitions. A profusion and fragmentation of public meetings saw more gatherings claim to represent a community, with hybrid forms of \u2018public meetings\u2019 providing different but not necessarily greater constraints on popular politics.[CITATION-216] This article has revealed the strange career of requisitioning for public meetings, emphasising in particular the role of local officials and magistrates in controlling public meetings; the hybridisation of the types of meetings assembled; and the initiative and skill of organisers in appropriating and subverting practices governed by requisitioning. As regards the first of these, conflicts over who could call public meetings, for whom, and about what, reveal the potentially porous boundaries of the political nation. Legal or violent reactions by local office-holders and magistrates could assist government repression, as Peterloo bloodily demonstrated. However, this reliance on local elites was combined with a deference to householders\u2019 privileges in the successive Seditious Meetings Acts; while emboldening the suppression of each new wave of mass gatherings in periods of revolutionary fear, the legislation paved a route to requisitioning public meetings where magisterial discretion relaxed. In Great Britain, state repression relied on local officials applying their powers to particular meetings according to their own personal prejudices and current anxieties; in Ireland, emergency legislation and central control from Dublin Castle created a very different political culture.[CITATION-217] In both cases, the judicial fabrication in the 1840s of \u2018seditious assembly\u2019 was the logical conclusion of discretionary judgement. If this arrested the increase in the scale of mass meetings, as well as discrediting requisitions as any measure of a meeting\u2019s legality, it could not reverse the variegated pattern of public meetings, now called in greater numbers by and for a broader range of people. By contrast, in the colonies of the British Empire, officials, judges, and laws discriminated among territories and peoples to provide even starker distinctions between legitimate gatherings and \u2018seditious\u2019 meetings.[CITATION-218] Although just one among a wide range of practices, requisitioning also illuminates some shifting patterns in the mobilisation of \u2018public\u2019 opinion over the. From 1780, written public requisitions seem to have spread as a means to demand or authenticate meetings that would offer resolutions or petitions on behalf of a place. If this initiated more discussion, resolutions, and petitions on public controversies, the requisition of official meetings still privileged the authority of propertied men. Craig Calhoun and James Vernon have argued, respectively, that \u2018[t]he bourgeois public sphere of the early nineteenth century marked a continued opening of aristocratic politics to members of the middle classes, but also a new exclusion of more plebeian and radical voices\u2019 constituting \u2018the closure of democratic political forms\u2019.[CITATION-219] In the case of public meetings, the exclusion and closure was only as novel as the innovative patterns of popular assembly that claimed constitutional traditions for new audiences and new purposes. As we have seen, efforts to exclude \u2018inhabitants\u2019 from county meetings sought to defend the \u2018demos\u2019 of freeholders as the numbers of general meetings proliferated. At other meetings, the closing down of unticketed admission and open deliberation reflected the proliferation, extension, and adaptation of what purported to be \u2018public meetings\u2019. These restrictions to meetings largely sought to defend traditional exclusions in novel contexts and amid claims for lawful, orderly public assembly, even if radicals cannily cast them as subversions of tradition.Finally, the practice of requisitioning public meetings elucidates the relationship between local and national initiatives. The meaning of the law and the constitution rested on creative argument and practical applications by local officials, agitators, and audiences; skirmishes over the local borderlines of political communities slowly accumulated into visions of a political nation. Rather than await parliamentary authorisation of expansion of the franchise, local initiatives helped dispel certain qualifications of property and assemble a broader community of inhabitants.[CITATION-220] As Benjamin Flowers noted in 1808, \u2018[e]very one in the least acquainted with the nature of popular meetings, convened for the consideration of public grievances, must be sensible of the exertions necessary to procure such meetings\u2019.[CITATION-221] The skills of local leaders fabricated and materialised \u2018public opinion\u2019 in the numbers assembled at meetings or in signatures to requisitions and petitions. Even if encouraged by co-ordinated national campaigns, their cumulative energies and the responsivity of grass-roots audiences determined the fate of national mobilisations. As requisitions rose and declined as part of broader transformations in popular politics, they demonstrated the ways in which formalised structures could provide a framework for, as much as a barricade against, local challenges as to who represented a community.",
