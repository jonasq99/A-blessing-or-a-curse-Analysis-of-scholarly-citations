It is also a contribution to wider scholarly debates about the making of a \u2018New Conservatism\u2019 in the 1940s and the development of Conservative thought in the twentieth century. The TRC\u2019s leading members drew on the party\u2019s Disraelian one-nation tradition to free them from adopting doctrinaire positions. They wanted to emphasise the merits of either state intervention, planning and social reform, or private enterprise, individualism and freedom, depending on the country\u2019s economic and social position\u2014and the party\u2019s electoral position. Most Tory Reformers imposed limits on the malleability of their Conservatism by rejecting laissez-faire individualism, socialism, and the earliest signs of neoliberalism. Although the group was replaced by the Design for Freedom Movement, which adopted a similar political outlook on a non-party basis between 1947 and 1949, its broader significance relates to how its support for the principles of \u2018design\u2019 and \u2018freedom\u2019 influenced Conservative debates about economic and social policy at a pivotal moment in the party\u2019s history. Continuities of thought suggest that we should be wary of interpretations which impose an \u2018origins of neoliberalism\u2019 or proto-Thatcherite framework on the 1940s. The TRC\u2019s \u2018New Conservatism\u2019 was meant to be adaptable, practical and Keynesian. It was a pitch for the centre ground and it was integral to the political thought of Conservative governments between 1951 and 1974.The outline of the history of the Tory Reform Committee (TRC) is well known. The TRC was made up of around forty to fifty backbench Conservative MPs between 1943 and 1947; it co-ordinated its members\u2019 parliamentary activities in order to apply pressure on the Conservative leadership to adopt progressive reforms; it employed a research staff; it published bulletins and pamphlets in the run-up to the general election of 1945; and it declined in importance after that election. The Tory Reformers hit the headlines on three occasions during the Second World War: first, when they supported the introduction of a system of statutory control over wages and working conditions in the catering industry; secondly, when they tried but failed to persuade the government to appoint a Minister for Social Security to implement the Beveridge Report; finally, when they moved two amendments to R.A. Butler\u2019s Education Bill, which promised to raise the school leaving age to 16 years and offer equal pay for women teachers. The last created controversy because the Tory Reformers helped to defeat the wartime coalition government on the equal pay issue. In Paul Addison\u2019s view, the TRC made efforts to accelerate the government\u2019s reconstruction programme and persuade the Conservative Party leadership to update its Conservatism.[CITATION-1] But, according to John Ramsden, these efforts were mostly unsuccessful because the TRC had little impact on Conservative debate, it failed to capture the interest of the party, and its only significant achievement was that it helped to \u2018prevent the old reactionaries from taking control\u2019 of the party during the war.[CITATION-2] These arguments about the TRC have been accepted by historians but, considering the group\u2019s high profile, it is astonishing that we know so little about its political thinking and organisation, and the reasons for its rise and fall.[CITATION-3] This gap in our knowledge is exacerbated by the fact that the TRC continues to hold an important place in the history of British Conservatism because it is recognised as a significant exemplar of the party\u2019s one-nation tradition.[CITATION-4] This article offers the first analytical overview of the political thinking and organisational development of the TRC. It addresses a significant lacuna in the historiography on 1940s Conservatism, but it is also an important contribution to wider scholarly debates about the adaptation of Conservative thought in the twentieth century. It argues that the most distinctive feature of the TRC\u2019s Conservatism was its commitment to Keynesian economics and state planning. The TRC\u2019s approach embraced the corporatist ideas of Conservative rebels such as Harold Macmillan, who had tried to develop a centrist alternative to Stanley Baldwin\u2019s \u2018national\u2019 politics in the 1930s. Its leading members fully accepted Keynesian economics as early as 1943, which was unusual inside the Conservative Party. But, like the Conservative \u2018planners\u2019 of the 1930s, its leading members did not believe that Keynesian demand-management techniques would solve all of Britain\u2019s economic problems after the war.[CITATION-5] The Tory Reformers embraced a \u2018mixed economy\u2019, but, like Macmillan, they wanted to preserve private enterprise and facilitate as much self-government for industry as possible.[CITATION-6] The Tory Reformers did much to publicise these ideas both during and after the war, but they saw no contradiction in their political thought when they modified their thinking to oppose the policies of the Attlee government in the late 1940s.In general terms, most of the leading Tory Reformers were ideologically consistent throughout this period because the \u2018New Conservatism\u2019 that they formulated was meant to draw on the party\u2019s Disraelian tradition in order to free them from having to adopt doctrinaire positions. They wanted to be able to emphasise either the merits of state intervention, planning and social reform, or those of private enterprise, individualism and freedom, depending on the country\u2019s economic and social position, and the party\u2019s electoral position. But in terms of specific policy some differences did emerge after 1945. The most influential members of the TRC, Quintin Hogg, Hugh Molson and Peter Thorneycroft, imposed some limits on the adaptation of the group\u2019s Conservatism because they rejected laissez-faire individualism, socialism, and the earliest signs of neoliberalism. But the TRC\u2019s founding Chairman, Viscount Hinchingbrooke, and his ally Christopher York were the first to leave the group because they wanted to emphasise individualism more strongly and abandon the TRC\u2019s interventionist policies ahead of the general election of 1950. Interestingly, it was the consistent interventionists, Hogg, Molson and Thorneycroft, who went on to have more successful careers in future Conservative governments, whereas Hinchingbrooke became a more marginal figure and York retired from the political scene altogether. The continuities between the TRC\u2019s thinking and that of its neglected non-party successor the Design for Freedom Movement suggest that we should be wary of interpretations which impose an \u2018origins of neoliberalism\u2019 or proto-Thatcherite framework on the 1940s. A close reading of the TRC\u2019s politics increases our understanding of how unity was maintained at the centre of the party during what was a very fluid and inchoate period for it ideologically.The only works that throw significant light on the TRC are the unpublished doctoral dissertations of Hartmut Kopsch and Harriet Jones. Kopsch\u2019s dissertation was limited to analysing the group\u2019s impact on parliamentary debates about the Catering Bill, the Beveridge Report, and the Town and Country Planning Bill during the war. It was not a dedicated study of the group and its political thought because he did not have access to the private papers of its leading figures. Kopsch\u2019s account also divided Conservatives into \u2018Tories\u2019 and \u2018Neoliberals\u2019, which resulted in a simplistic reading of the TRC\u2019s politics.[CITATION-7] Jones\u2019s dissertation built on Kopsch\u2019s work, arguing that the TRC \u2018was first and foremost based on political and short-term electoral considerations\u2019, that \u2018its primary concern was for propaganda\u2019, and that \u2018its primary argument with the more orthodox majority was not over principal [] but over strategy\u2019. She contrasted the TRC\u2019s \u2018short-termism\u2019 with the long-term thinking of R.A. Butler, who was Chairman of the party\u2019s Post-War Problems Central Committee (PWPCC). Jones also argued that it was the TRC\u2019s economic policy that distinguished it from the rest of the party.[CITATION-8] Richard Carr has challenged some of these arguments, suggesting that the Tory Reformers were never as progressive as we might think because they were not as committed to Keynesian economics as an earlier generation of Conservatives associated with Macmillan. He argues that they showed their \u2018true colours\u2019 after the party\u2019s defeat in 1945, and cites the evolving political thought and future political conduct of Hinchingbrooke, Hogg and Thorneycroft as evidence for his claim.[CITATION-9] Carr\u2019s intervention forces us to look again at the TRC\u2019s politics, but his use of evidence is somewhat selective. This article investigates the evolution of the political thought of these leading Tory Reformers in view of the changing economic and political circumstances of the 1940s and the 1950s. There was, in fact, an important area of ideological affinity between Macmillan and most of the Tory Reformers, which was centred on their support for Keynesian economics and state planning.There is an ever-present inclination among historians to see Conservatives in a black or white binary mode over state intervention, when in reality there were many shades of grey\u2014sometimes barely distinguishable. One of the most misunderstood periods in this respect is the 1940s. Kit Kowol has argued that historians \u2018have almost universally depicted the Conservative party as divided in two; between those more willing to embrace comprehensive social service provision and government economic intervention\u2019 and \u2018those committed to a minimal safety-net and free enterprise\u2019.[CITATION-10] This reading of Conservatism correlates with attempts to historicise Thatcherism by looking for signs of neoliberalism in the Conservative rhetoric of the 1930s and 1940s.[CITATION-11] But James Freeman has shown that the thinking of influential Conservatives such as Richard Law had more in common with inter-war Conservative debates about freedom and left-wing arguments about unemployment than it did with neoliberal thinking.[CITATION-12] Freeman argues that there is now a tendency among historians to play down \u2018historical specificity in search of influences, precedents, and ideological blocs\u2019, and he calls for more work on the \u2018specific political and economic dilemmas\u2019 that \u2018shaped the evolution\u2019 of Conservative arguments.[CITATION-13] This article builds on Kowol and Freeman\u2019s approaches to researching mid-twentieth century Conservatism, but it also responds to broader historiographical arguments. David Edgerton has argued forcefully for closer attention to be paid to the history of political \u2018futures\u2019 and particularly to Conservative visions of the future.[CITATION-14] This article responds to Edgerton\u2019s challenge, measuring not only the TRC\u2019s influence on the development of post-war Conservatism but also the degree to which the group\u2019s thought included \u2018roads not travelled\u2019. In doing so, it supports Ramsden\u2019s earlier arguments about the importance of continuities of Conservatism before and after the Second World War.[CITATION-15] But it also recognises that there were some important step changes in the development of the party\u2019s thought during the 1940s.A detailed examination of the history of the TRC in relation to these themes is now possible because the private papers of the most important members of the TRC\u2019s dining group, namely Hinchingbrooke, Hogg, Molson, Thorneycroft and York, were deposited in publicly accessible archives during the last fifteen years. These collections include some of the TRC\u2019s weekly agendas, memoranda, correspondence, and three private diaries. This article is the first work to exploit these sources fully and, by combining them with the journalism of the TRC\u2019s leading members and the group\u2019s publications, it offers the first comprehensive account of the TRC. The article evaluates the ideas of the TRC\u2019s leading members and measures their contributions to the making of a \u2018New Conservatism\u2019. In this respect, its approach to studying Conservative thought has much in common with Emily Jones\u2019s work on British Conservatism. Jones has argued that \u2018Properly historicized political traditions are not just a means to \u201ccomplicate\u201d our understanding of past thought: they offer a tool which helps us to understand the ways in which ideas are adapted: how principles and histories are altered in order to legitimate political action or rhetorical intervention; and how different strands of a broad-based political tradition such as Conservatism are picked up and put down accordingly\u2019.[CITATION-16] This article uses the TRC as a case-study for reflecting more broadly on how political traditions have been used by Conservatives to promote particular ideas in the practice of politics. In the case of the TRC, it was the Disraelian political tradition that was most influential.[CITATION-17] This article also examines how the TRC functioned as a group, how it responded to the party\u2019s electoral defeat, how its members adapted their thinking in opposition to a Labour government, and how it adjusted to the changing politics of the Conservative leadership. It tracks the political developments inside the group, highlighting some of the personal animosities and ideological fissures that emerged. It explores the group\u2019s relationship with other leading Conservatives, such as Macmillan, and investigates the degree to which its progressive Conservatism, committee system, research organisation and publications agenda influenced Butler\u2019s work for the PWPCC during the war and the Conservative Research Department (CRD) after the war. It also analyses why the TRC was replaced by Thorneycroft\u2019s Design for Freedom Movement, which adopted a similar political outlook but on a non-party basis between 1947 and 1949.More broadly, it seeks to argue that the TRC\u2019s historical significance was twofold. First, its support for the principles of \u2018design\u2019 and \u2018freedom\u2019 influenced Conservative debates about economic and social policy at a pivotal moment in the party\u2019s history. The TRC and its successor continued to use the language of \u2018design\u2019 in combination with \u2018freedom\u2019 because it allowed them to discuss a mode of intervention that was less socialist or statist than Labour\u2019s, and an economic outlook that could be used to distinguish Conservatism from laissez-faire Liberalism. The TRC\u2019s \u2018New Conservatism\u2019 was a direct pitch for the centre ground, and, if most of the interventionist strands of the TRC\u2019s thought were played down by the party in the run up to the 1950 and 1951 elections, some of them were picked up again by Conservative governments during the period 1951\u201374. Secondly, the TRC needs to be located within a broader history of \u2018young Turk\u2019 Conservative groups. It revived a particular reforming tradition inside the party, which had been inspired by Disraeli. But it also adapted that tradition in ways that would make Conservative thought more appealing for future generations.Hinchingbrooke first \u2018broached the subject of forming a group of young Tories who had progressive ideas\u2019 at a dinner with Thorneycroft and York on 11 November 1942.[CITATION-18] He wanted to create a new \u2018Centre Group\u2019 of Conservative MPs, and his inspiration was Winston Churchill and Hugh Cecil\u2019s \u2018hooligans\u2019\u2014a group of Tories who had tried to shake up the Conservative Party at the beginning of the century by rebelling against its leader, Arthur Balfour. Hinchingbrooke wanted to imitate the \u2018hooligans\u2019 by establishing a regular dining group, which would meet to determine the group\u2019s political aims and co-ordinate its parliamentary activities.[CITATION-19] The young and middle-aged Conservatives who would go on to serve on the TRC\u2019s Executive Committee had two things in common. First, they had served in the Armed Forces and returned to the House of Commons to devote all of their time to parliamentary politics. Secondly, they were in favour of social reform and Keynesian economics. Their decision to campaign for a more progressive Conservatism owed much to their experiences of war, but it was also a party-political move because they agreed that \u2018unless the Conservative Party accepted the Beveridge Report and similar reforms we would lose hands down\u2019.[CITATION-20] The TRC would quickly become an imaginative, ambitious and well-connected organisation. But the political context encouraged its founders to return to first principles; for Hinchingbrooke, this meant the party\u2019s Disraelian tradition. As he recalled, \u2018Our object was to sever an assumed link between the hierarchy of the party and latter day economic liberalism\u2014a \u201cdevil take the hindmost\u201d attitude\u2014and to release the true spirit of Toryism to soar again with Disraeli.\u2019[CITATION-21] The Tory Reformers would draw on and reinterpret important aspects of the Disraelian tradition in order to push their ideas in the party during the 1940s. Disraeli\u2019s association with the party\u2019s \u2018social reform and condition of the people tradition\u2019 was key during the war years because of the Beveridge Report.[CITATION-22] But, as young Conservative MPs, the Reformers were inspired by Disraeli\u2019s message that \u2018the Spirit of the Age is the very thing that a great man changes\u2019.[CITATION-23] Furthermore, as Jon Parry has explained, \u2018For Disraeli, the function of the tory/ Conservative party was to embody the \u201cnational will and character\u201d against ideological threats to English traditions. The tory policy was national in two senses: it was rooted in history, but (except when badly conceived by blinkered leaders) it was also integrative rather than exclusive and sectional.\u2019[CITATION-24] The Tory Reformers were particularly attracted to these dimensions of Disraeli\u2019s thought because, once adopted, they could use them to present the groups\u2019 members as unifiers. They would also invoke the Disraelian tradition to call for economic and social reforms that could revive and defend \u2018true\u2019 Conservative principles.Hinchingbrooke outlined his ideas in a series of articles and speeches, arguing that \u2018Modern Toryism rejects Individualism as a philosophy in which the citizen has few duties in society, but accepts wholeheartedly initiative and personal enterprise of the citizen in partnership with his friends and neighbours to a purpose agreeable to the Nation as a whole.\u2019 He accepted state planning as a \u2018grand design\u2019 that could be used to bring the aims of the individual into line with those of the community.[CITATION-25] The country\u2019s experience of two world wars persuaded him that \u2018high taxation, fat wage packets, and full employment go together\u2019, but he believed in \u2018equality of opportunity\u2019 rather than \u2018equalitarianism\u2019.[CITATION-26] Tory Reformers like Hinchingbrooke wanted to make a new progressive Conservatism because they believed that a sense of balance between the individual and the community had been lost between the wars. In other words, the Disraelian one-nation tradition had not been followed. But the policies that they advocated were not necessarily designed to be permanent ones. When Hinchingbrooke addressed the future of small traders at a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce he argued that, while their economic and political sacrifices would be substantial, \u2018all sections [of society] should have those privileges and liberties curtailed in equal measure, so that we end this war not as a State transformed into a mould foreign to our natures but with that nucleus remaining \u2026 that will bud and blossom forth in happier days and restore to us that freedom for individual trade and scope for individual enterprise that are our heritage\u2019.[CITATION-27] Hinchingbrooke and another Tory Reformer, Quintin Hogg, looked specifically to Disraeli\u2019s novel(1844) for intellectual inspiration and for the development of a political framework that could be used to persuade Conservatives to adopt a new Conservatism.[CITATION-28] Hogg outlined their Disraelian influences in an article forin which he stressed the need for the party \u2018to lead and dominate revolution by superior statesmanship, instead of to oppose it\u2019. He also argued that only a mixed economy was appropriate for the reconstruction of Britain after the war:The New Conservative \u2026 sees in the modern extra-political forms of public control a Nationalisation which has lost its terrors, and in the larger joint-stock companies with limited liability a private enterprise which has lost its meaning. He is not impressed by the fear of schemes for social security as destructive of enterprise. On the contrary, he sees in them the basis for social stability necessary to the restoration of industry. He recognises that privilege based on birth or wealth has served its end, and he looks forward to a classless democracy in which differences of education and technical skill have taken their place.These arguments would have been difficult for some Conservatives to accept, but Hogg made little effort to appease their concerns, stating that only the youth of the country was objective enough to understand the \u2018New Society\u2019.[CITATION-29] In other words, the Tory Reformers were best placed to address the problems of Britain\u2019s political future.The dining group\u2019s first attempt at developing a set of provisional aims was made by Hinchingbrooke, Thorneycroft and York.[CITATION-30] They advocated \u2018State intervention to restrict opportunity for personal profit\u2019, but they were worried about \u2018unduly limiting scope for individual enterprise and the ultimate liberty of the individual\u2019. Specific proposals included the transferring of control of public services and stabilised industries to autonomous bodies that would be subject to parliamentary control; the transferring of financial ownership \u2018in all businesses to management and employees\u2019; limiting the activities of the stock exchange; state supervision of the banking system so that it would be forced to provide adequate financing for large and small-scale enterprises; and the establishment of a wage structure to secure a balance in the flow of public money to the wage earner. They also contemplated changing the law so that property ownership would \u2018not stand in the way of public welfare\u2019.[CITATION-31] The Tory Reformers did not agree on all of these points, but they provided a basis for future co-operation.[CITATION-32] The group dined with Macmillan, who told them that he considered his own backbench rebellion in the 1930s to have been a failure. He was sympathetic towards their campaign for social reform because he considered the Beveridge Report to be a Tory idea.[CITATION-33] But, he insisted, \u2018One must work and scheme and manoeuvre inside the party and seek to make the machine serve the ideals which one has.\u2019[CITATION-34] Hinchingbrooke also listened to the Minister of Agriculture, Robert Hudson, who had been one of Macmillan\u2019s collaborators when they were members of the progressive Conservative ginger group the \u2018YMCA\u2019 in the 1920s.[CITATION-35] He learned from Hudson how the group had worked with ministers and supported the Conservative government in the Parliament of 1924.[CITATION-36] The TRC\u2019s founding members saw themselves as playing an important role in the history of the party, which was to use their position as a progressive ginger group to persuade it to update its Conservatism.By January 1943 the leading Tory Reformers were dining regularly together.[CITATION-37] After Hogg joined the group he wrote in his diary, \u2018We start with few prejudices\u2014and progressive ideals. But we are still in the thinking stage.\u2019 He identified Thorneycroft as the group\u2019s leading \u2018spirit\u2019 in whom he had \u2018great belief\u2019.[CITATION-38] Hogg and other MPs then met with a group of agents from industrial insurance offices who wanted to lobby them ahead of the parliamentary debate on the Beveridge Report.[CITATION-39] Hogg recalled that he rejected their arguments because he believed in the \u2018broad acceptance of the recommendations of the report\u2019; he dated the real beginnings of the TRC to this meeting.[CITATION-40] Before the debate Hinchingbrooke and a sizeable number of backbench Conservatives tabled an amendment calling for the immediate creation of a Minister for Social Security.[CITATION-41] Hinchingbrooke tabled the amendment because he considered the government\u2019s motion to be \u2018wishy-washy\u2019 and he believed a group of \u2018reactionaries\u2019 wanted to \u2018sabotage\u2019 the report. He welcomed the potential party-political consequences of the group\u2019s actions, writing that \u2018A big party split is in prospect. I welcome it. Now is the time!\u2019[CITATION-42] Tory Reformers made prominent speeches during the Beveridge debate.[CITATION-43] Hogg made a passionate appeal for \u2018the redistribution of wealth\u2019, telling his fellow Conservatives that there was \u2018no burking that fact\u2019.[CITATION-44] But the government refused to appoint a Minister for Social Security. The Tory Reformers voted with the government on its general statement of policy, but they were not satisfied with its explanation for the rejection of their amendment. Hinchingbrooke led a deputation of forty-five backbench Conservatives to complain to the Leader of the House, Anthony Eden.[CITATION-45] The deputation made little difference, but it led to the official forming of the TRC one month later. Hinchingbrooke was made Chairman with both Thorneycroft and Molson appointed as secretaries.[CITATION-46] The Beveridge Report provided a convenient way for some Tory Reformers to illustrate their differences with more traditional Conservatives, but it was also the reason why they were able to attract a large membership.Hogg explained how the TRC functioned in an unpublished memoir written in the 1960s: \u2018The Tory Reform organisers used to meet three times a week. One meeting, the main meeting of the Committee, was always in a Committee room upstairs. [This] would usually be preceded by a meeting of the executive to discuss the agenda for the coming meeting of the Committee. But the main motive power was in the dinner party where, free from \u2026 a definite agenda our conversation ranged over the whole spectrum of politics, personalities, parties and political affairs \u2026 our main work was undoubtedly in \u2026 the debates in the House.\u2019[CITATION-47] This activity gave the TRC an unusual level of professionalism for a Conservative ginger group. York was enthusiastic about the abilities of his fellow members: \u2018Quintin has a terrific brain power and Hugh Molson, though pompous, is a master of lucid expression and exposition. Hinch is very forward thinking. The others in varying degrees quick, clear thinking, and progressive Tories.\u2019[CITATION-48] However, the TRC was not the only new Conservative ginger group. After meeting with the Conservative MP Alexander Erskine-Hill, York wrote, \u2018He gave us to understand that he had an organization, separate from the Conservative Party, to push Tory ideas. But by what he said and how he said it, it was obvious that Beaverbrook is behind it. We all agreed that Erskine-Hill is a very crafty and dishonest politician in the worst sense.\u2019[CITATION-49] This was the Progress Trust, of which little was known until very recently. The Progress Trust was a clandestine Conservative group, which usually consisted of around twenty Conservative MPs. Its members met for a few hours each week to discuss politics, it entertained leading ministers at its dinners, and it employed a research officer to produce weekly memoranda.[CITATION-50] Richard Ritchie\u2019s new history of the Progress Trust has used the group\u2019s archive to shed light on its thinking and activities. Certainly, it was known to represent the \u2018ultra-loyal core of the Conservative Party\u2019 and it was \u2018somewhat resistant to change\u2019.[CITATION-51] But, as Ritchie argues, it is too simplistic to view all of the group\u2019s members as libertarian Conservatives in this period. He explains, \u2018The bias of most was towards a patrician approach with only a modest inclination to challenge fundamentally Beveridge\u2019s philosophy. They all believed in free enterprise and opposed nationalisation. But they were far from asserting there was no need for state intervention in the economy.\u2019[CITATION-52] Ritchie\u2019s account accurately dates the beginnings of the group to March 1943 and disputes the view that it was set up to counteract the TRC, which has been an ever-present argument in the historiography.[CITATION-53] Both groups started to organise themselves at the same time and, while some members of the Progress Trust disliked the TRC, there was no orchestrated attempt to challenge its existence. Historians should also be cautious about seeing the two groups in polar opposition at all times. The two groups met for dinner on several occasions during the war years.[CITATION-54] York admitted on another occasion that there was very little \u2018visible disagreement\u2019 between them, noting that \u2018The right wing and ourselves are Tories.\u2019[CITATION-55] Furthermore, research papers produced by the Progress Trust can be found in York\u2019s and Hogg\u2019s papers from 1945 onwards.[CITATION-56] Hinchingbrooke even went on to join the Progress Trust in 1947.[CITATION-57] But R.A. Butler, who was starting to rebuild the party\u2019s policy-making apparatus, was concerned about the emergence of the TRC. He wrote in his diary: \u2018The Conservative Party Conference went off quite well, giving a vague and amiable impression of progressive spirit. This was deliberately arranged by the Central Office, though the Press have got the impression that it was generated by Ronnie Tree, Quintin Hogg and others, who have joined with Hinchingbrooke as a \u201cginger\u201d group.\u2019[CITATION-58] Butler, who was struggling to juggle his work on the coalition government\u2019s Education Bill with his role as Chairman of PWPCC, was a party loyalist. When he stepped down from his role as Chairman of the PWPCC he argued that his consensual approach to Beveridge and social reform had brought Conservatives \u2018to think the reforms less awful than they might\u2019.[CITATION-59] The problem was that the TRC were becoming more famous for their reforming spirit than Butler because they were not willing to compromise, as he was, for the good of the party.Still, when the Tory Reformers met to finalise their manifesto they were worried that the Progress Trust would try to \u2018torpedo\u2019 its publicity.[CITATION-60] When the manifesto was published asit was presented as a list of basic aims, and professed the Tory Reformers\u2019 loyalty to the heritage and traditions of the Conservative Party. But in terms of policy they accepted Keynesian economics and argued that government must influence or control expenditure in order to regulate demand. They called for a practical approach to a mixed economy, which required national planning (but less than during the war). They wanted to maintain freedom for small businesses, but larger businesses would be subject to public control. They argued for the extension of a system of production committees, which trade unions would help fashion. They supported economic expansion and full employment, but regional industries would also be diversified, more training would be offered, and more help would be provided to encourage mobility of labour and guard against unemployment. On agriculture, they agreed to maintain a system of stable prices. On social reform, they supported guaranteed minimum wages and a system of social insurance on the lines proposed by Beveridge. They wanted to keep freedom of choice in education and health and to encourage wider property ownership. But, unusually, they advocated ending the marriage bar and the exclusion of women in areas of employment, reiterated their support for equal pay, and called for an immediate improvement in maternity care for women.[CITATION-61] After the launch of the manifesto the members of the dining group seized complete control of the TRC by reorganising it. As York explained, this meant \u2018an enlarged Executive Committee consisting mainly of the Group but camouflaged so as to get T.R.C. to agree\u2019. He thought that this was a \u2018big step forward on our march to capture the Party\u2019.[CITATION-62] Hogg, Molson, Thorneycroft, and Robert Spicer of the Political Research Centre (PRC) sat on the most important TRC subcommittee, which oversaw general Tory Reform policy. Each subcommittee was asked to \u2018produce a policy for approval in principle by T.R.C.\u2019, which could be published as a pamphlet.[CITATION-63] F.C. Hooper, the Director of the PRC, proposed the organisational structure, which was modelled on Political and Economic Planning.[CITATION-64] Little is known about the PRC, but Hooper had been given the task of setting it up by Conservative Central Office (CCO) because party officials wanted him to create \u2018Tory publicity which Central Office could not do by reason of the Prime Minister\u2019s position\u2019. Funded by CCO, it was meant to bypass the \u2018party truce\u2019 that Churchill was determined to honour. But in practice the party made little use of it and when Hooper became disillusioned about his role both he and Spicer threw \u2018in their lot with the Tory Reform Committee\u2019.[CITATION-65] Hooper was an experienced businessman who had been mentored by the entrepreneur Frederick Marquis when he was a director of Lewis\u2019s department store in Liverpool in the 1930s.[CITATION-66] Marquis was elevated to the peerage as Lord Woolton in 1939 and, partly because of his non-party credentials, he was made Minister of Food in Churchill\u2019s wartime coalition government. Hooper had left Lewis\u2019s in 1941 to set up the PRC and he had ambitions to become a Conservative candidate. He wrote a number of articles for thein which he promoted the TRC. He supported a bi-partisan approach to social services and he backed full employment policies, but he questioned the use of state \u2018compulsion\u2019 in the economy.[CITATION-67] York disliked Hooper and he would later write that \u2018Hooper and Woolton and P.R.C. have been castigated by theas big business trying to knuckle in on T.R.C. It has made my determination to get rid of Hooper\u2019s liaison with T.R.C. the more urgent.\u2019[CITATION-68] Nevertheless, the PRC helped the TRC to develop its publications and prepare for parliamentary debates.What the TRC had achieved in six months was impressive. It had attracted a sizeable number of Conservative MPs, set up an office with two paid research officers, published a list of aims, intervened in a number of prominent debates in the House of Commons, and gained a reputation for being a dynamic group of \u2018young Turks\u2019 moulded in the Disraelian one-nation tradition. What set it apart from earlier groups such as Disraeli\u2019s \u2018Young England\u2019 in the 1840s, the \u2018Fourth Party\u2019 in the 1880s, the \u2018Hooligans\u2019 in the Edwardian period, and the \u2018Young Unionist group\u2019, the \u2018YMCA\u2019, and the \u2018Boys Brigade\u2019 in the inter-war years, was the size of its parliamentary following and its sophisticated approach to political research and publishing.[CITATION-69] This would serve as a direct example for Conservative groups such as One Nation in the 1950s. It also marked the beginning of a transition for such groups because some of its leaders and members were not as patrician as members of earlier groups. Still, it would be the One Nation group\u2019s MPs, part of the celebrated \u2018class of 1950\u2019, who would make the largest strides in this direction.[CITATION-70] The TRC\u2019s early success and unity would not last. When the dining group tightened its grip on the broader committee, its members experienced their first major row. Thorneycroft, Molson and Hooper were unhappy with Hinchingbrooke\u2019s comments about state intervention in the economy, which were published in the: \u2018I hold that the State must retain a general measure of control over all transport systems, aircraft manufacturing, coal production and distribution, milk distribution, agriculture and forestry, banking, finance and investment, including building societies. We cannot return to the domination of private finance over any field that caters for simple human wants.\u2019[CITATION-71] Thorneycroft disapproved of Hinchingbrooke\u2019s comments because they had not been sanctioned by the group in advance of the launch of the manifesto, and he disliked the ambiguity of some of the statements: \u2018My main criticism of the article itself is the loose references to a general measure of State Control over banking, agriculture etc etc\u2014what does it mean? It might mean anything or nothing.\u2019[CITATION-72] Clearly, Hinchingbrooke had no settled vision of what his ideas would look like in practice. Some months earlier he had told a member of the Society of Individualists: \u2018We believe in enterprise divorced from the control of \u201cfinance\u201d but not remarried to a Socialist Bureaucracy. Your \u201cBevins and Beveridges\u201d are only invited to assist at the first ceremony.\u2019[CITATION-73] Hinchingbrooke wanted to establish a middle way between extreme forms of \u2018individualism\u2019 and \u2018totalitarianism\u2019.[CITATION-74] But he could envisage a number of different Conservative futures.When Hinchingbrooke announced that he was planning to make a speech at the Progressive Business Men\u2019s Forum, Thorneycroft and Molson became annoyed.[CITATION-75] York, Hogg and other members sympathised with Hinchingbrooke because the TRC had been founded so that independent Conservative views could be aired. But Thorneycroft threatened to resign.[CITATION-76] York considered this to be unwarranted, believing that Thorneycroft had been \u2018influenced by Hooper\u2019s materialistic outlook & Hugh\u2019s political mania\u2019, but he conceded that \u2018we must prevent Hinch from coming into disrepute as a dreamer\u2019.[CITATION-77] It had not helped that Molson had annoyed York earlier that day by sending the group a memorandum on family allowances and Beveridge, which \u2018made a plausible but shallow argument in favour of letting up on our pressure\u2019. York considered this to be a \u2018disgusting bit of low politics\u2019, suggesting that there were differing levels of commitment to social reform among the group\u2019s members. Thorneycroft was angry with Hinchingbrooke because he believed that afterthe TRC \u2018were within measurable distance of capturing the party machine\u2019. But York and other members thought that this was \u2018nonsense\u2019.[CITATION-78] In the end, Thorneycroft climbed down and withdrew his threat to resign. Molson\u2019s less progressive memorandum was also rejected.[CITATION-79] The TRC then befriended Lord Woolton, who had recently been made Minister of Reconstruction. After dining with the group, Woolton wrote in his diary, \u2018They wanted to know what my ideas for the future were, and they are very friendly-disposed to me and will, I think, support me. They are the group with whom Hooper is associated.\u2019[CITATION-80] But Butler remained suspicious, especially after he visited the group\u2019s headquarters. He told the party Chairman, Thomas Dugdale, \u2018What alarmed me was that the cuckoo in the nest was now becoming rather large.\u2019 Butler believed that \u2018a certain subtle propaganda has been put about that the Central Committee is dull and arid, but it is the Tory Reform people who have the brilliance and the wit, the energy and the discrimination\u2019. He did not think they were \u2018particularly Conservative\u2019 and he was surprised to learn that the party-funded PRC was only being used by the TRC. Butler was looking for staff for the PWPCC and he had hoped to recruit individuals from the PRC, but he was disappointed by what he saw and he was worried about a \u2018dichotomy beginning to exist between the two different research centres\u2019.[CITATION-81] Meanwhile, Thorneycroft\u2019s patience with Hinchingbrooke ran out and he proposed that the TRC should have an annually selected Chairman. As York wrote, Thorneycroft threatened to resign \u2018because he can never rely on Hinch not to make a big gaffe which as Chairman of T.R.C. rebounds to the discredit of all members\u2019. York disagreed with Thorneycroft: \u2018I take the view that the Hinch\u2019s flights may sometimes be wrong but they are what inspires confidence in the country.\u2019[CITATION-82] But when he sounded out a number of other members of the Executive Committee, he found that most sided with Thorneycroft.[CITATION-83] Things came to a head with Hogg proposing himself as a stop-gap chairman. York \u2018held out for Hinch or bust\u2019, but the \u2018Peter\u2013Hugh\u2013Hooper axis\u2019 won.[CITATION-84] Hinchingbrooke judged Thorneycroft to be \u2018ruthless and ambitious\u2019 and he believed that Thorneycroft was jealous of his public presence as Chairman of the TRC.[CITATION-85] But he made way for Hogg as the new Chairman.[CITATION-86] He believed that if he had refused to resign he would only have won a \u2018pyrrhic victory\u2019 because the most talented members of the group would have resigned.[CITATION-87] Hinchingbrooke remained in the TRC, but he resigned from the Executive Committee and decided to attend the dining group less frequently.[CITATION-88] The Conservative MP Alexander Spearman advised Hogg that forty to fifty members had been too many and that the chairmanship might be an impossible task, which could damage his political career.[CITATION-89] But Hogg accepted the chairmanship, and when Butler\u2019s Education Bill went through the House of Commons the TRC voted against the government on the issue of raising the school leaving age to 16, which reduced the government\u2019s majority to thirty-seven.[CITATION-90] The TRC had wanted to secure the raising of the school leaving age to 16 by 1951, but Butler\u2019s Education Bill had not specified an exact date for implementation.[CITATION-91] The TRC then followed this up by introducing an amendment calling for equal pay for women teachers. When the TRC\u2019s votes helped to defeat the government, Churchill responded by turning the issue into a vote of confidence.[CITATION-92] As York admitted, \u2018The government\u2019s reactions to the defeat on committee were swift and deadly \u2026 T.R.C. has been outmanoeuvred and this won\u2019t do it any good.\u2019[CITATION-93] When it passed through Parliament, Butler\u2019s Education Act of 1944 was widely perceived to be a progressive reform, establishing secondary education for all through a three-tier state schooling system made up of grammar, secondary modern and technical schools. The TRC had embraced these elements of Butler\u2019s Education Bill, but they had also tried to pressure the government into committing itself to additional forward-looking reforms.After the controversy over the Education Bill, Butler and James Stuart, the party\u2019s Chief Whip, met with the TRC to inform them that they were closing down the PRC and discontinuing the party\u2019s indirect funding of the group.[CITATION-94] This was a blow and Butler appears to have seized the opportunity to try and bring an end to the activities of the TRC at a time when the group\u2019s reputation among party leaders was at an all-time low. Butler was prepared to offer them a way back into the party fold, but he expected them to fit in with the party\u2019s statement of general aims. In a speech at a TRC dinner, he highlighted aspects of his Conservatism that they had not endorsed: \u2018I confess that I am influenced by the attitude taken up by Hayek in his \u201cRoad to Serfdom\u201d \u2026 We are fighting to preserve an independent society made up of small people of individual will \u2026 But all this freedom will be of no avail unless we keep as close as we can together and share as much as we can in common.\u2019[CITATION-95] If Butler\u2019s speech was an olive branch it had no immediate effect because the TRC went \u2018after the Party with renewed vigour\u2019.[CITATION-96] Although the TRC\u2019s reputation had taken a hit among the upper echelons of the party, it is clear that York and other Tory Reformers believed that their actions had helped to establish their credentials with like-minded progressives. Therefore, the TRC agreed to set up their own research organisation to replace the PRC and Spicer was persuaded to continue in new offices in Westminster.[CITATION-97] Butler believed he had detected a softening of attitude on behalf of the TRC, but the Tory Reformers needed convincing that his plans would come to fruition because he had not yet found any researchers or a publicity officer.[CITATION-98] In the meantime, the TRC continued to regroup. Their next move was \u2018to get Stephen King-Hall into the T.R.C. and to start tentatively to form T.R.C. associations in the country\u2019.[CITATION-99] King-Hall had been elected as the National Labour MP for Ormskirk at a by-election in 1939, but he had already become an independent MP by this point in time. He was famous for producing a four-page weekly essay known as the, which had a circulation of 60,000 copies by 1939. David Butler wrote that the newsletter \u2018had enormous impact among a wide range of insiders as well as among the politically inquisitive public\u2019.[CITATION-100] Therefore, King-Hall would have been a valuable addition to the TRC because he could have helped publicise the group\u2019s activities, but he was not allowed to join because he was not a practising Conservative.[CITATION-101] To make matters worse, Ralph Assheton was appointed as the new party Chairman; his Conservatism emphasised economic and financial orthodoxy.[CITATION-102] Hogg was thus obliged to write to Assheton to explain that the TRC\u2019s goal had always been \u2018to strengthen the position of the Conservative Party\u2019. He rejected Assheton\u2019s claim that the TRC believed in nationalisation, but he made it clear that the TRC rejected \u2018the economic and political principles of \u201cLaissez-faire\u201d individualism\u2019.[CITATION-103] Assheton accepted that both parties could \u2018work together in harmony\u2019, but he had not forgotten the TRC\u2019s actions on the Education Bill.[CITATION-104] With difficulties mounting, Hinchingbrooke reflected on the TRC\u2019s record. He argued that the group\u2019s regular bulletins had \u2018done useful damage between the Athenaeum and Marsham Court, a vital area\u2019. But he sensed that the group had lost momentum because of its lack of initiative in Parliament and the fact that it had \u2018no independent standing in the constituencies\u2019. He detected a falling-off in newspaper coverage of the group, and believed that Hogg\u2019s and Thorneycroft\u2019s recent election to the 1922 Executive Committee had been cancelled out by Assheton\u2019s elevation to the party chairmanship and Herbert Williams\u2019s election to the Executive of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations.[CITATION-105] Hinchingbrooke believed that the group\u2019s failure to influence the party was related to its members becoming \u2018bogged down in the routine of Parliamentary life\u2019 and being \u2018fearful of the Conservative machine and its power at the next election\u2019.[CITATION-106] Hinchingbrooke thought that two-party politics could be coming to an end and that the TRC had missed a trick by not letting King-Hall join. He believed that the group\u2019s secretariat was not fit for purpose because Thorneycroft was doing too much of the writing. Resigned to the fact that the TRC would not be able to influence the party before the next election, he argued that they \u2018should lay ourselves out as a vehicle for entry into the Party of Liberals, National Labour and Independents of the Centre and Left Centre\u2019. He suggested that they should consider changing the group\u2019s name if it was a hindrance to co-operation because \u2018It is sheer lunacy that a name and a tradition alone should exert such a hold in a revolutionary age.\u2019[CITATION-107] Hinchingbrooke and some of the leading Tory Reformers were more coalition-orientated than some of the Conservatives serving inside the wartime coalition government. But their outlook was too far ahead of Churchill and other important figures like Macmillan and Woolton, who all engaged in debate about changing the party\u2019s name after 1945.[CITATION-108] In any case, others in the TRC identified more strongly as Tories and did not want to rethink their politics in this way. York wrote that \u2018the time now is right to gather up loose ends and consolidate the Party for the general election. We have done our job of helping the government over the reconstruction measures and done it well. Our job was to move the Conservative Party and we did it.\u2019[CITATION-109] The 1945 election marked the end of a specific phase in the TRC\u2019s brief history. The group had maintained pressure on the party so that it would not shy away completely from economic intervention and social reform, and it had refused to disband itself until the party took significant steps to reform its organisation, particularly in areas of long-term political planning, research and publishing.The TRC\u2019s leading members shifted their attention to what they could contribute to the 1945 election campaign and the challenges the party would have to confront if it was tasked with forming a government. The TRC\u2019s response was a major new policy document entitled, which was published in January 1945. It was written by Thorneycroft, Molson, Alfred Beit, Ralph Glyn and J.A. Cecil Wright. Its title signalled the group\u2019s shift away from its focus on social reform towards the post-war reconstruction of the economy. The Tory Reformers argued that \u2018full employment\u2019 and social security policies would not be enough to support an \u2018expansionist\u2019 economic policy. They blamed British governments, business managers and organised labour for failing to maintain the country\u2019s lead in technical and industrial efficiency. They stated that it was now the government\u2019s responsibility to facilitate the re-equipment of industry, to promote colonial development, to co-operate with the British Dominions to develop the Empire \u2018as a joint enterprise of free and equal partners\u2019, and to co-operate with industrialised nations to raise the standard of living in \u2018industrially backward\u2019 countries.[CITATION-110] The Tory Reformers argued in favour of a system of multilateral trade, although not free trade because they insisted that \u2018there is room for a planned sector both in imports and exports at the highest level of financing and negotiation\u2019.[CITATION-111] They wanted \u2018to postpone a return to peace-time standards of consumption\u2019 and to persuade the public to invest in a \u2018Peace Savings Campaign\u2019 to finance the re-equipment of industry. The government would intervene through taxation and a new public corporation to make sure funds were spent on re-equipment. The government would frame the country\u2019s industrial policy, but individual industries would be left to manage themselves subject to government supervision. The Tory Reformers judged political arguments about state and free enterprise to be \u2018sterile\u2019 because \u2018more enterprise\u2019 was desperately needed.[CITATION-112] breathed new life into the TRC\u2019s policy agenda, but the group\u2019s future as a ginger group was questioned for the first time at an Executive Committee meeting ahead of the general election. Churchill\u2019s speech at the party conference had caused some members to ask whether the work of the Committee was done. But, as Andrew Thorpe has argued, Churchill\u2019s \u2018Four Year Plan\u2019 was meant \u2018to close a debate, not open one\u2019.[CITATION-113] Arguments in favour of continuation included the view that its activities had already \u2018won the lasting enmity of the opposite wing of the Party\u2019 and that the \u2018influence and respect enjoyed by T.R.C. as an entity\u2019 would be lost if they were disbanded. Concerns were also raised that Churchill\u2019s speech \u2018was not acceptable to all sections of the Party\u2019. The TRC\u2019s members concluded that the dissolution of the group would be misinterpreted by \u2018opposing papers and the general public\u2019, which could damage them and the party. Therefore, they were \u2018strongly in favour of continuation\u2019.[CITATION-114] The TRC also voted in favour of maintaining the secretariat, even if its members were concerned about the additional financial burden in an election year. Most agreed that the reputation of the TRC depended on its \u2018well thought out policies\u2019 and publications. In terms of plans for the potential expansion of the TRC\u2019s activities, different options were explored, including constituency work, the studying of electioneering methods, collaboration with industry, fundraising, the establishment of a Tory Reform Association or League, and an extended publicity campaign that would include the \u2018methodical contribution of letters and articles of a polemical character\u2019 and the establishment of a periodical. But the TRC was now almost entirely dependent on its parliamentary members\u2019 subscriptions so expansion was not possible.[CITATION-115] As the wartime coalition government was reaching its end there was a minor reshuffle, and it frustrated the TRC\u2019s Executive Committee that initially none of them were called.[CITATION-116] Some weeks later, however, Hogg was made Under-Secretary of State for Air. He was then reappointed to the position in Churchill\u2019s caretaker government, serving under Macmillan. Thorneycroft was made Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of War Transport; other TRC members, including Thelma Cazalet-Keir, Hamilton Kerr and Ronald Tree, were appointed to junior posts. This success meant that Hogg and Thorneycroft resigned as Chairman and Secretary of the TRC. They were replaced by Molson as Chairman and Everard Gates as Secretary, with the group deciding to \u2018mark time\u2019 until the election.[CITATION-117] Some of the TRC\u2019s leading members were rewarded with positions in the government because of their TRC activities, but it was probably also a tactical move to try to neutralise the TRC ahead of the election.[CITATION-118] The Conservatives suffered a severe defeat in 1945, but of those members discussed here only Thorneycroft lost his seat. In early August he was already planning to stand in the Monmouth by-election in October. York recorded in his diary that \u2018He agrees we shall need T.R.C. as much as before and suggests that we concentrate on instilling into people that the days of laissez-faire and the free economy are over for good. If the Conservative Party refuses to accept this fact, then we can have no future as a Party.\u2019[CITATION-119] After Thorneycroft was re-elected he threw himself into research with renewed vigour, but those close to the Conservative leadership were also redoubling their efforts. At a TRC meeting in August, Molson reported that Hudson had told him \u2018that a new system of committees supported by a Secretariat and Research Department was being set up by the leaders of the Party\u2019 and that they now hoped \u2018that both T.R.C. and the Progress Trust would wind up their activities and co-operate with the rest of the Party\u2019. Most members accepted this in theory and wanted to co-operate, but only if the party would \u2018accept almost in full the outlook of the T.R.C. and ... set up an adequate Research Department before any such merger was possible\u2019.[CITATION-120] The TRC met with Churchill and Eden to seek reassurances about the party\u2019s proposed changes. Eden explained that the party would be returning to the conditions of 1924 and 1929, when it had last been in opposition, and that it wanted the TRC to co-operate with the party\u2019s new policy committees because without them \u2018it would be almost impossible to provide sufficient vigorous members\u2019. Another prominent TRC member, Claude Lancaster, revealed that he and Thorneycroft were already planning \u2018a really large and high-grade Research Department to which the leaders of industry would be willing to put their ideas of reorganisation, in order that the Conservative Party might have a well thought out and authoritative alternative to the Socialist Government\u2019s proposals in every branch of the national, industrial, financial and economic life\u2019. But Eden told Lancaster that the group should invite Butler to meet with them so that he could discuss his plans for the Conservative Research Department.[CITATION-121] The TRC surveyed its members and a number of conclusions were reached. It was decided that the TRC should continue to meet regularly to co-ordinate its parliamentary activities and that the group\u2019s own secretariat should be kept. But there was some anxiety about continuing the group\u2019s publishing strategy, which is why it was agreed that the decision to publish should be left to the individual member. Members still agreed that it was important to try to infiltrate the 1922 Committee, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and other influential bodies, and most members agreed with Arthur Harvey\u2019s comment that there should be no disbanding of the TRC \u2018until there was a real change of heart on the part of the Party\u2019.[CITATION-122] After the election York was initially encouraged by the fact that Cranborne was \u2018now contemplating a Land Policy on the lines of my earlier suggestions\u2014the professional landowner or trustee\u2019.[CITATION-123] But senior Conservatives such as Viscount Cranborne were irritated by the TRC\u2019s refusal to fall in line with the party. By October, Cranborne was close to giving up on the TRC as a useful element in the party. He told Paul Emrys-Evans, \u2018I am sorry, as it always seemed to me that they might be a most valuable element in the party. But they seem to have no idea of building up a new philosophy of Toryism. All they want is to get back into power &, if possible, to get office for themselves.\u2019[CITATION-124] At the same time, Molson was incapable of being a unifying figure as Chairman when the TRC needed to renew itself. York\u2019s frustrations with him reached boiling point when he recorded in his diary, with a hint of schadenfreude, that \u2018Hugh Molson has been shot\u2014by his Chairman!\u2014at last someone has done it, though it was only one pellet and a ricochet.\u2019[CITATION-125] Nevertheless, the TRC\u2019s first major loss was Hinchingbrooke, who parted company from them on 7 November. Despite this setback, York noted in his diary that \u2018the numbers were larger than before the election\u2019. But without Hogg and Thorneycroft leading from the front, the TRC was suffering from a crisis of leadership, which resulted in York suggesting that they should ask Macmillan to lead them, even if he admitted that it was \u2018not a very clever suggestion\u2019 because Macmillan was \u2018a very ambitious politician and most unlikely to like the idea\u2019.[CITATION-126] Cranborne also advised the TRC to \u2018attach\u2019 themselves \u2018to a new star\u2019, and Lancaster suggested Macmillan, Richard Law, Eden or Cranborne. Significantly, they chose Macmillan. It was also at this time that York\u2019s scepticism of Thorneycroft began to take root. He noted that \u2018Thorneycroft, cunning and I fear unprincipled, almost committed himself to leaving the front opposition bench after Christmas.\u2019[CITATION-127] Hogg also wanted to resign from the Conservative front bench, but not before Thorneycroft did the same. His dissatisfaction with the party\u2019s progress was published regularly in his column in the. On 20 November he complained that the TRC had been pressured into shutting down its machine because it had been accused of producing \u2018dangerous thoughts\u2019 while Churchill read Hayek \u2018in the bath\u2019.[CITATION-128] The TRC did not believe that the party was moving quickly enough in a positive direction but they met again with Macmillan who told them that he and other leading Conservatives would try to persuade Churchill to let Eden run the party in the House of Commons. The TRC liked what Macmillan told them, but he refused to become the group\u2019s new Chairman.[CITATION-129] Macmillan had been one of the TRC\u2019s earliest supporters and had contemplated joining them when he was stationed in the Mediterranean.[CITATION-130] But he only co-operated with the group on an informal basis, and by the time he was asked to lead the TRC he had returned from the war with his political reputation significantly increased. He had served as Secretary of State for Air in Churchill\u2019s caretaker government and recently returned to the House of Commons after winning the Bromley by-election.[CITATION-131] It made no sense for Macmillan to lead the TRC when he was better placed to influence the party leadership.Nevertheless, Macmillan and the leading Tory Reformers continued to meet and correspond after the general election because they shared ideas about how to manage the economy and make industrial policy. Molson wrote to Macmillan, who was a member of both the party\u2019s Fuel and Power and Trade and Industry Committees, explaining that he and Thorneycroft were concerned about the party\u2019s potential over-reaction to Labour\u2019s policy of nationalisation: \u2018I feel that it would be an entirely superficial view to argue the nationalisation issue merely on the basis of whether ownership vests in the State or not. The important question is to provide such management as will ensure production in large quantities at a low price and will enable Parliament and the public to see the financial results.\u2019 Molson explained how the TRC\u2019s Bulletin on the Retail Distribution of Electricity was based on the McGowan Report and the Chamberlain government\u2019s white paper of 1938. The policy advocated the rationalisation and national administration of retail electricity, but no change of ownership. Similarly, Molson and Thorneycroft accepted the Heyworth Committee\u2019s report on the gas industry, which advocated a decentralised or regional form of public ownership. The Labour government planned to adopt the latter proposal, which had resulted from an independent committee set up by the wartime coalition government. Molson could see little difference between the TRC\u2019s attitude towards electricity and the government\u2019s plans for gas, and so thought it made no sense for the party to oppose the latter on the grounds that it amounted to public ownership. He also explained that the TRC\u2019s earlier proposals for the coal industry \u2018fit in quite harmoniously\u2019 with those for electricity and gas. Molson, a key ally of Macmillan during the 1930s, reminded him that \u2018in \u201cThe Middle Way\u201d you went further in 1938 and recommended out and out Nationalisation\u2019.[CITATION-132] Macmillan replied to Molson that he was \u2018in general agreement\u2019 with what he had written and that he thought the Tory Reformers must attend the next joint meeting of the Fuel and Power and Trade and Industry Committees so that they could support him.[CITATION-133] Macmillan and the Tory Reformers supported a \u2018mixed economy\u2019 based on industrial reorganisation, technical efficiency and Keynesian economics. But Molson\u2019s views also fitted with an emerging vein of managerialist thought, made famous by James Burnham\u2019s influential book(1941), which suggested that ownership was increasingly divorced from control.[CITATION-134] After Macmillan turned down the TRC\u2019s offer, York had major doubts about launching a new TRC campaign because he believed the party\u2019s problem was a lack of leadership not policy. Most of the TRC\u2019s members disagreed with him, arguing that \u2018policy was more important\u2019. So when Thorneycroft finally broke with Churchill over the terms of the American loan agreement, the stage was set for a new campaign.[CITATION-135] At the same time, Molson was criticising the party publicly. He argued that \u2018It is at present impossible to explain our Party\u2019s policy regarding nationalization or commodity markets or monopolies or Keynesian economics because it has never been worked out.\u2019 He wanted the CRD to employ trained economists who were \u2018capable of original and constructive thinking\u2019.[CITATION-136] A TRC memorandum also stated that they still believed that there had been \u2018no indication that all the experience and valuable research work of the T.R.C.\u2019 had been \u2018appreciated and taken into the Party Organisation\u2019. But the problem was that older members were now concerned that the TRC had become a \u2018rallying point for disruptive elements in the Party\u2019.[CITATION-137] The political context had changed considerably between the publication ofand the summer of 1946. The Labour government had begun to implement nationalisations (of the Bank of England and civil aviation in 1946), which greatly worried many Conservatives, including some Tory Reformers. At the same time, Conservatives had started to get over the shock of the party\u2019s defeat in 1945 and look towards the political future. Even York, who had been nicknamed the \u2018Bolshevik Baron\u2019, wanted the party to use MI5 to try to undermine the Labour Party and its MPs.[CITATION-138] But it was the party\u2019s moves to step up its serious policy work and reform its organisational structures that finally persuaded most of the TRC\u2019s members to question the group\u2019s future. Between November 1945 and July 1946, a number of important developments occurred. First, Butler\u2019s PWPCC was put on a \u2018peacetime footing\u2019 and rebranded as the Advisory Committee on Policy and Political Education (ACPPE). Secondly, the Conservative Political Centre (CPC) was established as the executive arm of the ACPPE on the education side, run by Butler\u2019s ally Cuthbert Alport; it would soon produce a vast number of political publications. Finally, the CRD was re-started under Butler\u2019s chairmanship.[CITATION-139] But, as Ramsden explained, \u2018It was not until the Summer of 1946, with Woolton\u2019s appointment as Party Chairman, that the Party organisation began to revive and it was only at about the same time that the policy apparatus began to function properly again.\u2019[CITATION-140] For these reasons, it appeared that the TRC was going to lose another of its founding members. York had threatened to resign in February.[CITATION-141] He continued to be a member for a while longer, but he now wanted to close down the TRC. Other members disagreed, especially Molson, whose outlook, according to York, depended on him being in disagreement with the party.[CITATION-142] Crucially, both Woolton and Cranborne continued to meet with the TRC to reassure its members that the party was moving in the right direction. According to Michael Kandiah, as an independent Minister for Reconstruction, Woolton, next to Churchill, had become \u2018the most popular and identifiable government minister\u2019 during the war. He had also \u2018produced the wartime coalition government\u2019s famous white papers on health, education, social security, and employment\u2019. This had resulted in Woolton being made Lord President of the Council during Churchill\u2019s brief caretaker government in 1945. But more importantly, Churchill made him Chairman of the Conservative Party in July 1946, which meant he joined the party.[CITATION-143] Woolton promised the TRC that he would set up a research organisation at Central Office and give it \u2018all the equipment it required\u2019. Coming from him, this must have been very reassuring because it confirmed that Butler\u2019s efforts would receive the full support of the party.[CITATION-144] The leaders of the TRC still wanted the party to promote a dynamic progressive Conservatism in the Disraelian tradition, which was both adaptable and forward-looking. But it was easier for them to put their faith in Woolton, because of his ministerial record, than it had been with Assheton.After the party had accepted the need to reform, it was perhaps inevitable that the TRC would either run out of steam or disband itself so that its members could contribute to the party\u2019s wider reforms. But it was only after a resolution was passed at the Party Conference in October 1946 that Churchill was persuaded to accept the need for a new statement of Conservative policy. Hogg had been one of the speakers who had demanded that the party \u2018prove the fallacy of Labour\u2019s claim that Tories had no policy but. Although Eden and Churchill had called for \u2018a Nationwide Property-Owning Democracy\u2019 in their conference speeches, the exact meaning of this was a point of contention because it was not yet clear whether the party would tread a path of economic liberalism, which Conservatives such as Assheton wanted, or more state interventionism. But, as Ramsden wrote, \u2018the demand at Blackpool was for action\u2019 and this \u2018opened up the way for the policy model that men such as Butler had wanted since at least 1943\u2019. The result was the establishment of the Industrial Policy Committee under the chairmanship of Butler, which would produce the party\u2019s most important post-war policy document, the(1947).[CITATION-145] The TRC had played a significant role in pressuring Churchill and the party to move in this direction and Thorneycroft, along with Macmillan, was included on the list of members of the committee, but he withdrew his membership to run a rival political campaign in support of his own policy. He justified it as a means of uniting Conservatives and Liberals before the next general election.[CITATION-146] York\u2019s diary entries illustrate Thorneycroft\u2019s ambitions: \u2018Peter gave us the full plan of his campaign, based on his document setting out a new Tory Industrial policy. The general feeling was that Peter should run his campaign without the official support of the Tory Reform Committee but with the help of its members. This would leave him free to collect Liberal and National Liberal support while keeping the support of the wise middle Tories.\u2019 This was a significant change for the TRC, as Thorneycroft was no longer limiting his work to influencing the Conservative Party. York believed that Thorneycroft\u2019s motivations were careerist: \u2018Peter has burnt his boats, so far as the party bosses are concerned. He is aiming for the top of the tree on his own. He realizes that he cannot hope to succeed on his own without the backing of this dinner party to increase his strength within the party.\u2019[CITATION-147] TRC meetings were held to consider Thorneycroft\u2019s document and York judged it to be \u2018brilliant\u2019, but he thought it promoted \u2018the wrong conception of the duties and capabilities of the State\u2019.[CITATION-148] He added, \u2018The State Trading paragraph is objected to by all. Peter defends it as a weapon to use against inefficient and secret private monopolies. I think the TRC agrees with me that the role of the State is strategic planning. The state department will not have time to own productive industry.\u2019[CITATION-149] Thorneycroft redrafted the document \u2018to cut out state trading except as a weapon against monopoly\u2019, which meant that York agreed to sign it.[CITATION-150] Perhaps Thorneycroft\u2019s lurch towards Conservative\u2013Liberal co-operation can be explained by his desire to differentiate his own agenda from that of the party\u2019s reforms, which had moved onto TRC territory.offered a means for Thorneycroft to rebuild his reputation after he was seen to have been rebellious and it provided a fresh agenda for the TRC. Hogg, Molson, Lancaster, Thorneycroft and York, the core leadership of the TRC, signed, but most members of the TRC did not, probably because it was not considered to be Conservative. The TRC\u2019s leaders were also not convinced that the plan would succeed. York wrote that Thorneycroft\u2019s \u2018efforts to influence the liberal candidates with his industrial and commercial policies\u2019 were not that successful and Lancaster, the TRC\u2019s new chairman, confirmed that the party\u2019s leaders thought that Thorneycroft was \u2018out to replace them\u2019.[CITATION-151] When the TRC dined with Macmillan, he told them that he \u2018thought it would be useful if we could commit Liberal candidates to sign it\u2019.[CITATION-152] The TRC had recently moved into a new office in Westminster, which they were sharing with a group of Liberal candidates.[CITATION-153] The TRC also dined with the Liberal MP Roderick Bowen and the Liberal National MP David Renton to discuss a union of the parties. But York wrote that \u2018It was clear that union would only be possible if a propitious moment arrived when they agreed to adopt a new name.\u2019[CITATION-154] Of the two, only Renton signed, but when the pamphlet was published it included a significant list of Liberal and Liberal National candidates and MPs as official signatories.[CITATION-155] was pitched as a movement and it contributed to the swift decline of the TRC. Thorneycroft tried to get Macmillan to sign, but he refused to sign any documents unless they were written \u2018by committee presided over by Butler\u2019.[CITATION-156] In producing, Thorneycroft had engaged in an act of \u2018privateering\u2019 from outside of the Industrial Policy Committee and this had angered both the Chief Whip, James Stuart, and the Conservative MP Harry Crookshank, who wrote that \u2018the young man wants kicking\u2019. Perhaps more damaging was the fact that Anthony Eden had decided that he \u2018should not like to go tiger-shooting with that man\u2019.[CITATION-157] The Design for Freedom Movement was, however, only ever meant to provide an entry point for Liberals into the Conservative Party, which was consistent with Conservative strategy since the 1920s.[CITATION-158] Certainly, the party leadership was interested in building a \u2018United Front Against Socialism\u2019 in this period.[CITATION-159] The Woolton\u2013Teviot Pact established an alliance with the Liberal Nationals in April 1947, while Churchill and Woolton tried to encourage wider Conservative\u2013Liberal co-operation based on resistance to nationalisation before and after the 1950 general election.[CITATION-160] Churchill also asked the Liberal leader Clement Davies to join his government in 1951, but his offer was rejected because the Liberal Party demanded proportional representation in return.[CITATION-161] Thorneycroft\u2019s political antennae were not out of tune with the goals of the party leadership, but he chose to plot his own course in the hope that he could win back the party\u2019s favour. Initially, he was seen to be disloyal, but his work for the TRC meant that his abilities were widely recognised inside the party. As a result, Thorneycroft was appointed President of the Board of Trade by Churchill when the party returned to government in 1951.[CITATION-162] With the TRC in decline, York started to rethink his politics. He wrote, \u2018I had a hunch about Conservative Policy and wrote a five page memo on why we had not and could not have a policy because we only differed in degree and not in fundamental policy, from the socialists.\u2019[CITATION-163] Two days later, he wrote: \u2018The conclusion I wished to find was whether we ought to go on the same road we had travelled for the past 30 years or whether we ought now to strike out on an anti-collectivist road, and let the people decide which road they wished to take.\u2019 These doubts made him rethink the political contribution he had made as a \u2018social democrat\u2019 through the TRC and he became concerned that he had legitimised Labour\u2019s politics.[CITATION-164] When Thorneycroft and Lancaster announced that they wanted to continue with Design for Freedom and restart the weekly meetings of the TRC Executive, York rejected the idea because his views were no longer compatible: \u2018We should strike out on a new line which may be based on Property Owning Democracy\u2014Co-partnership and elimination of bureaucratic organisations\u2014government or commercial.\u2019 York then resigned from the group.[CITATION-165] The TRC limped on, but Lancaster wrote to Hogg in November to inform him that the TRC had decided to wind up its activities because \u2018it is evident that the majority of the Party are now of our way of thinking and that the work in the past has consequently borne fruit\u2019. Regular meetings were cancelled, but the TRC agreed to meet for dinner three times a year.[CITATION-166] York had followed Hinchingbrooke, who had adapted his political views significantly after leaving the TRC. Hinchingbrooke had decided that the economic and social problems that had prompted the Beveridge Report would be solved by 1950 and that Conservatives would need to turn their attention to the problems of consumption and higher wages brought about by economic expansion.[CITATION-167] He argued that the Labour government was prioritising \u2018social security and equality at the price of economic progress\u2019 and that the party should prioritise a more \u2018competitive society\u2019 based on \u2018consumer choice\u2019.[CITATION-168] He thought the party needed to shift its thinking away from \u2018State Authority to Laissez Faire to balance the movement of the Left in the opposite direction\u2019. He spoke of \u2018a progressive return to individualism, free trade, the price structure, the rule of law, and society based on contract rather than on status\u2019. Therefore, he thought state planning and protectionism should be largely abandoned. The denationalisation of large industries and the breaking up of private monopolies would lead to an increase in the number of small traders, which would help to modernise British industry thanks to increased competition. Hinchingbrooke wanted to create a \u2018property-owning democracy\u2019, \u2018co-partnership\u2019 schemes in industry, and more \u2018private capitalists\u2019.[CITATION-169] Left-wing journalists like Michael Foot considered Hinchingbrooke\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 views to be farcical because he had been the founder of the TRC.[CITATION-170] But his views were consistent with what he had outlined at the Chamber of Commerce in 1942. He had always envisaged a tilting of the scales back towards individualism and private enterprise after a period of economic expansion and social reform. His views on property ownership and decentralisation fitted an important dimension of the Disraelian tradition, but it is undeniable that eventually he would move so far in the direction of laissez-faire that his Disraelian one-nation credentials, at least in terms of how the TRC had promoted them, were no longer sustainable.[CITATION-171] He was far ahead of the political zeitgeist, even if his outlook fitted the party\u2019s election rhetoric in 1950 and 1951. His increasingly strong emphasis on individualism meant that he would have more in common with groups such as the Progress Trust, the Society of Individualists, and the National League for Freedom. In terms of the party leadership, his politics looked towards a distant Conservative future that the One Nation group of the 1950s started to articulate but that only fully emerged in the late 1970s.York had shifted his thinking because he wanted to oppose Labour more strongly and, as Ramsden argued, he might also have come under pressure from his local constituency association to harden his rhetoric against \u2018collectivism\u2019.[CITATION-172] All of this was in line with the party leadership\u2019s approach to the 1950 election. Despite the lasting influence of the wartime coalition government\u2019s politics on the party and the publication of its more interventionist \u2018charters\u2019, it was the party\u2019s anti-socialist \u2018freedom\u2019 rhetoric that dominated the campaign. As Kandiah has explained, for the Conservatives \u2018Controls, rationing and austerity were not necessary but were the result \u2026 of Labour\u2019s \u201cmis-government\u201d\u2019, and by linking austerity and socialism the party was able to appeal to more women and middle class voters.[CITATION-173] The Cold War also had a strong influence on the party leadership from 1947 onwards because Churchill and other prominent Conservatives helped to bring about a \u2018conservative human rights revolution\u2019 in Europe in defence of western Christian civilisation.[CITATION-174] Conservative leaders encouraged binary political positions in order to distinguish Conservatism from socialism, which meant the politics and ideas of wartime dissolved quickly into a new political alignment that promised to \u2018set the people free\u2019 during the Cold War.[CITATION-175] However, Thorneycroft continued to develop his one-nation ideas in pamphlets.[CITATION-176] His most important was(1949), which built on his ideas as outlined in the TRC\u2019s pamphletsand. Nigel Harris argued that Thorneycroft was \u2018one of the earliest and most consistent exponents of a neo-Liberal case\u2019.[CITATION-177] But there is no evidence to support this claim. Thorneycroft argued that \u2018the respective roles of public and private enterprise, the degree of State planning which is desirable, will always be questions in dispute and the answers to them may well vary from time to time\u2019.[CITATION-178] He stressed the need for Conservatives to adopt \u2018a diversity of methods\u2019 when tackling economic problems, the need to resist being \u2018doctrinaire\u2019, and to \u2018judge cases upon their merits\u2019 in view of changing economic circumstances.[CITATION-179] He also argued that \u2018a free economy is by no means necessarily a stable one. Moreover, left to itself large parts of it quite often stop being free. The problem of the trade cycle; the tendency of industry to adopt monopolistic devices or of Trade Unions to adopt restrictive practices; the complex issues which surround the question of foreign trade do not, alas, just solve themselves. Planning in these fields is a vital part of Government activity.\u2019[CITATION-180] Thorneycroft always accepted the need for state planning and full employment policies under certain economic circumstances, even if he would later be influenced by \u2018monetarist\u2019 ideas. E.H.H. Green was right to argue that, as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Macmillan\u2019s government, Thorneycroft based his economic ideas \u2018on the same blend of Keynesian and Hawtreyan economic paradigms that were the essence of 1950s demand management\u2019.[CITATION-181] We should not forget that, as Chancellor, Thorneycroft was also willing to appoint a Council on Prices and Incomes, which was the first attempt by a Conservative government to institutionalise an incomes policy.[CITATION-182] Neil Rollings was correct in noting that \u2018there has been a tendency to exaggerate the differences between Thorneycroft and Macmillan\u2019 and that Thorneycroft\u2019s resignation as Chancellor in 1958 \u2018was more to do with bad judgement on his part than a fundamental disagreement of principle\u2019.[CITATION-183] Thorneycroft\u2019s later appointment as Party Chairman by Margaret Thatcher in 1975 should not cloud our view of his earlier politics or obscure the fact that he remained a one-nation Conservative for the rest of his life. His Conservatism continued to evolve during the 1960s and early 1970s in ways that serve to reinforce the view that he had broken with Macmillan because of his increasing interest in \u2018monetarism\u2019. But his resignation as party Chairman in 1981 probably saved him from coming into any disagreement with Thatcher on future policy.[CITATION-184] But what of Molson and Hogg? Molson continued to argue in favour of a mixed economy based on a combination of state planning and private enterprise in industry. But his language was slightly different. He rejected the view that the party should oppose \u2018nationalisation\u2019 completely because it had played a role in using the state to plan Britain\u2019s railway infrastructure and electricity grid, as well as contributing to the reorganisation of the coal industry. He saw these developments as an endorsement of partial nationalisation and he wanted Conservatives to adopt a \u2018common sense\u2019 approach. For Molson, \u2018industrial government\u2019 would always rest upon an \u2018unstable balance of leadership and control, of enterprise and responsibility\u2019.[CITATION-185] There was no question of him wanting to tilt the scales as far towards private enterprise and individualism as Hinchingbrooke and York proposed. This should not surprise us if we consider that Molson had been an important member of ginger groups that had campaigned for state planning and industrial reorganisation during the 1930s. He had worked with Macmillan on(1935) and(1935), and towards the end of his life he identified Macmillan as his \u2018intellectual superior and inspirer\u2019.[CITATION-186] Hogg drafted the party\u2019s programmein 1949, but just three years earlier he had argued: \u2018Perverse fellow that I am, I am a Conservative and a planner. Like my friend, Mr. Harold Macmillan, I want to see a National Plan for Britain under a Conservative Government.\u2019 Ahead of the next election he had called on Conservatives to \u2018start planning to reduce the jumble to sense\u2019.[CITATION-187] For Hogg, state intervention or planning was important, but private enterprise had to be emphasised more than it had been during the war if Britain was to succeed with a \u2018philosophy of expansion\u2019.[CITATION-188] Hogg wove all of these ideas into his book, which was published in 1947. He highlighted the adaptability of Conservative thinking and continued to reject both laissez-faire individualism and equalitarianism. He argued that the party needed \u2018to present a Conservative social and industrial policy based on social democracy, equality of opportunity and a planned economy without state monopoly or the abolition of private enterprise\u2019.[CITATION-189] Interestingly, after reading, Hinchingbrooke wrote to Hogg to confirm that he was \u2018delighted to find that there is no fundamental difference between us in doctrine\u2019. But Hinchingbrooke, who had been reading T.D. Weldon\u2019s(1946), explained that he rejected Hogg\u2019s view that Conservatism was \u2018allied to the organic theory of the State\u2019 because he now believed that it should be \u2018exclusively reserved to Fascism and Communism\u2019. Hinchingbrooke wrote that he was now \u2018thinking more of the old Liberal Democratic theory of the mechanical basis\u2019.[CITATION-190] Hogg disagreed with him, arguing that he saw it \u2018as a valuable theory of society, and one which is necessary to put forward in order to controvert the various Left Wing doctrines at the only point at which most of them converge, namely with the theory that there is such a thing as the ideal State\u2019.[CITATION-191] Whereas Hinchingbrooke seems to have ditched this aspect of Disraelian Conservatism because of the renewed threat of totalitarianism, Hogg felt no need to give in to such pressure. Hinchingbrooke was the only leading Tory Reformer who was willing to push his thinking beyond the limit of what the Disraelian tradition could be made to incorporate in this period, but his early exit from the group demonstrated that he was less committed to the TRC\u2019s ideas. He stood out as the boldest and most reckless of all of the Tory Reformers who had sat on its original Executive Committee.The Disraelian political tradition as the Tory Reformers interpreted it provided enough scope for them to adapt their Conservatism. This was because they believed that the central tenet of Disraelian Conservatism was its ability to embrace the politics of the future and to adapt Conservative thought to position the party at the head of a new society. Most of the leading Tory Reformers continued to believe in the importance of state intervention, but they understood that in the political context of 1949\u201351 there was a need to respond to concerns about state controls, rationing and freedom. The TRC\u2019s support for state intervention had helped to create the momentum for the ideas that were in the, and, as Martin Francis has argued, \u2018Contrary to all expectations raised by the bold rhetoric of \u201cset the people free\u201d which had been so loudly proclaimed in 1950 and 1951, Conservative governments in the 1950s looked more to Disraeli than to Hayek as an inspiration for their programme of \u201cNew Conservatism\u201d in action. The conflict between libertarian and paternalist traditions within the leadership had largely been decided in favour of the latter by the mid-1950s.\u2019[CITATION-192] The policies of the Macmillan government after 1957 were built on the Disraelian one-nation political tradition, incorporating Macmillan\u2019s \u2018middle way\u2019 of the 1930s and the party\u2019s charters and the TRC\u2019s ideas of the 1940s. Macmillan\u2019s \u2018New Approach\u2019 of 1962 was a further \u2018shift away from the more cautious and less interventionist policies pursued in office since 1951\u2019. Both Macmillan and Edward Heath invoked this strand of Conservative thinking to develop national incomes policies as they sought to modernise the British economy and British industry in ways that were similar to French indicative planning and the social market policies of West Germany.[CITATION-193] These ideas were picked up and put down accordingly, depending on the economic, party-political and electoral circumstances. To some degree this was political expediency, as Jim Tomlinson has argued.[CITATION-194] But the history of a group such as the TRC shows that Conservative political traditions are important because they are used to promote particular ideas in the practice of politics. The TRC was more flexible and more nuanced in its positions than has been generally depicted, partly because we often see it through contemporary observers and opponents who latched on to certain aspects (particularly the Keynesian interventionist dimensions and, for the critics, the neo-Socialist) and highlighted them in a simplistic way. The party\u2019s outlook as a whole was just as flexible; when seen through this lens it should not shock us that Tory Reformers like Hinchingbrook and Thorneycroft rethought their Conservatism continuously and boldly in response to the changing economic and political circumstances of the 1940s and 1950s. Stuart Ball\u2019s reading of the development of the party\u2019s political thought in the twentieth century is relevant here: on a number of occasions a \u2018re-examination did not find the basic principles of Conservatism to be wanting, and it was rather the case that they needed to be returned to and reinforced, with certain themes of greatest relevance to current conditions given more emphasis and placed in the foreground. There was, therefore, considerable continuity in the party\u2019s interpretation of the world and of itself; policies were adapted, even abandoned, but principles were not.\u2019[CITATION-195] For the TRC, it was Disraelian principles that mattered. But if many aspects of the TRC\u2019s political thought were picked up again between 1951 and 1974, some of the group\u2019s ideas remained \u2018roads not travelled\u2019. Some members of the TRC pushed ideas that included the public ownership of industry and land, albeit within certain limits. The TRC\u2019s debates also show that some were willing to endorse microeconomic intervention in industry if political circumstances had demanded it. But, as Tomlinson has argued, the party refused throughout this period to intervene on the microeconomic level by \u2018getting \u201cinside\u201d the firm\u2019.[CITATION-196] The Tory Reformers were distinct from \u2018neoliberals\u2019 and \u2018proto-Thatcherites\u2019 because they were happy to alternate between emphasising the importance of state intervention to maintain full employment and the welfare state, and advocating a greater reliance on freedom, the individual and private enterprise to increase both production in industry and the national wealth, depending on the current state of Britain\u2019s expansionist economy. In this respect their version of the Disraelian political tradition was always meant to be adaptable, practical and Keynesian. There were also some important differences between the Tory Reformers and the One Nation group that followed them. Hogg respected Enoch Powell as an intellectual but he disagreed with \u2018almost all his characteristic ideas\u2019. Even in the late 1960s Hogg believed in a mixed economy, state planning, full employment policies and publicly financed social services. Hogg criticised Powell for believing that the \u2018price mechanism\u2019 was the only essential \u2018means of determining what is economically desirable\u2019. For Hogg, the price mechanism was just one of many important economic criteria that could and should be used, and he wrote that his visit to the North-East as Macmillan\u2019s special \u2018envoy\u2019 for regional unemployment in 1962 provided an illuminating case-study, which showed the limitations and weaknesses of Powell\u2019s position.[CITATION-197] The Tory Reformers had wanted to provide the basis for a new politics of the centre and for this reason their Conservatism could never be doctrinaire in its approach and application. Like Disraeli, they strove to establish \u2018an organic unity\u2019 and \u2018to build a synthesis\u2019 in politics \u2018to make England a nation again\u2019.[CITATION-198] Thorneycroft\u2019s attempt to recapture the TRC\u2019s momentum through the Design for Freedom Movement failed to unite Conservatives and Liberals in the way that he had hoped, but its central idea reflected the outlook of all of the leading Tory Reformers who helped the party develop its thinking and electoral message during the 1940s. As they also understood, the trade-off between \u2018design\u2019 and \u2018freedom\u2019 would always be subject to negotiation inside the party, but it would frame the politics of Conservative governments between 1951 and 1974.The TRC needs to be located within a broader history of \u2018young Turk\u2019 Conservative groups seeking to innovate in areas of economic and social reform, as part of a recurrent mode of Conservative responses to a sense of changing times and the danger of opponents on the left acquiring dominance in the battle of ideas, especially if only challenged negatively. Molson identified the TRC\u2019s heritage explicitly when he sought to defend the group\u2019s reputation in the Conservative-leaning periodical the: \u2018At intervals in the history of the Conservative Party, groups have formed amongst the back-benchers to urge upon the leaders a new and more realistic policy than they were following \u2026 We have perhaps been more fortunate than they in having had less long to wait for the hearts of our leaders to turn to the wisdom we are preaching.\u2019[CITATION-199] Harriet Jones\u2019s claim that the Tory Reformers were primarily strategic and focused on short-term political goals compared to Butler\u2019s long-term projects does not do justice to the group\u2019s history.[CITATION-200] Both the TRC and Butler sought to combine short-term strategies with long-term thinking. The Tory Reformers valued the TRC because it was based on a methodological approach to politics, which included serious research and policy-making, a heavyweight publications strategy, and co-ordinated parliamentary activity. But most importantly they wanted the party to be able to respond intellectually in ways that it had struggled to do between the wars, which meant the establishment and maintenance of structures that facilitated long-term Conservative thinking. Although the TRC reintegrated itself into the party after it lost its momentum, this was acceptable to most of the Tory Reformers because they believed they had revived the party\u2019s reforming tradition and helped it to embrace the \u2018spirit of the age\u2019. In any case, a new Tory Reform Group (TRG) would take its inspiration from both the TRC of the 1940s and the One Nation group of the 1950s when it emerged in 1975. As a left-leaning progressive Conservative group, the TRG adapted the term \u2018one nation\u2019 as it was then being used to include the promotion of more state intervention in ways that were consistent with the ideas of the TRC and Macmillan\u2019s \u2018middle way\u2019.[CITATION-201] In this respect, the Tory Reformers achieved one of their core objectives, which was to make Conservatives think more seriously about progressive Conservative ideas, and how they could be adapted to influence the politics of the future.",
