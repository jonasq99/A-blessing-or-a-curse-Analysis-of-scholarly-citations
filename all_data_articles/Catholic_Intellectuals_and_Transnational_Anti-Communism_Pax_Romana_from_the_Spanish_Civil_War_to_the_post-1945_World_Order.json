It examines Pax Romana, the Swiss-based international association of Catholic students and graduates, as it navigated between fascism and resistance in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and during the global conflict of 1939\u201345. The organisation was headed successively by two young activists from Spain, Joaqu\u00edn Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, a legal scholar from Madrid who fought for Franco, and Ramon Sugranyes de Franch, a Catalan literary specialist who went into exile in 1936. Comparison of their parallel careers forms the central narrative cord of the article, illuminating the complex relationship of national to global Catholic fractures between conservative nation-statists and political and social pluralists. The Pax Romana congress held in Spain in 1946 was pivotal in accounting for the transnational legacy of that country\u2019s civil war. The wartime \u2018humanist\u2019 critique of Franco\u2019s \u2018crusade\u2019 made by key Catholic public thinkers was both disseminated and challenged and its relevance to Europe\u2019s future assessed. Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, as its president, used the organisation from Spain to legitimate the country\u2019s regime, aided by sympathetic foreign nation-statists. Sugranyes, in contrast, gravitated in the early 1940s to Fribourg in Switzerland, Pax Romana\u2019s headquarters\u2014via Geneva, Paris and southern France\u2014encountering and allying with progressive Catholic exiles from Italy and Spain and French anti-fascist resisters. Although taking different routes, both men ultimately transcended their nationally rooted religious and political assumptions through dialogue across boundaries.When military rebels, including Francisco Franco, rose up against the elected Spanish government in July 1936, the state structures of the Second Republic were destabilised. This allowed leftist revolutionary militias, in response, to target middle-class Catholics with elite political backgrounds or a connection to the military rebellion. Among hundreds imprisoned in Madrid, ostensibly for their protection, was the 23-year-old scholar of canon law and president of Spain\u2019s Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional de Estudiantes Cat\u00f3licos (CNEC), Joaqu\u00edn Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, and his two brothers. The CNEC functioned within the orbit of Catholic Action, the Vatican\u2019s main transnational conduit of social Catholicism, allied closely in Spain with the elite intellectual publicists of the Asociaci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica Nacional de Propagandistas (ACNP), founded in 1909. These bodies were vehicles for mobilising Catholic society against the government\u2019s social and religious reforms of 1931\u20133 and for overturning the Republican constitution which separated Church and state. Amid the inchoate revolution which broke out in response to the military coup in 1936, the lives of the Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez brothers were therefore in peril. Their release was secured only because of the intervention of the Republican wartime Minister of the Interior, \u00c1ngel Galarza. After taking refuge in the Panamanian embassy, they departed safely for rebel territory to join up with the insurgent forces, as did large numbers of political Catholics whose unity was sealed by what quickly became Franco\u2019s \u2018crusade\u2019.[CITATION-1] At virtually the same moment that Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was arrested in Madrid, his Catalan contemporary, the literary specialist Ramon Sugranyes de Franch, fled revolutionary Barcelona for Switzerland. The network of student internationalism to which Sugranyes was connected made escape possible. As vice-president since 1929 of the Catalan Catholic student federation, he was invited in August 1936 to the first conference of the World Youth Congress at the League of Nations in Geneva and issued with a safe conduct to travel by the Catalan Republican government. Following the failed military coup in Barcelona, his position as a Catholic student organiser made Sugranyes as vulnerable to attack by criminal elements as Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was in Madrid. Incipient Christian Democracy was more vigorous in Catalonia than in most of Spain and the Federaci\u00f3 Catalana d\u2019Estudiants Cat\u00f2lics had supported the Republican government when the regime was inaugurated in 1931.[CITATION-2] Sugranyes was, moreover, publicly active in the Republican project for an autonomous university in Barcelona, relatively independent of the central state, as an expression of regionalist civic sentiment. But his consequent misgivings about the Spanish military rebellion did not diminish the personal threat to his life in the revolutionary summer of 1936. This ambivalence would later prevent him from returning to Franco\u2019s Spain for many years.This article compares the parallel traumatic experiences of Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes de Franch during and after the Spanish Civil War. The biographical comparison reveals a shared cultural conditioning as young activists within a global Church as well as an undercutting of this commonality by fundamental differences. Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez (1913\u20132009), a Spaniard from Madrid who fought for Franco, became a professor of civil and religious law in the early 1940s while acting internationally on behalf of the head of state. He was publicly unstinting in his loyalty, never contradicting the myth of Franco as saviour of the Spanish nation-state and defender of \u2018the Christian West\u2019. Relative to Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, the Catalan-speaking Sugranyes de Franch (1911\u20132011) was a Catholic outsider, as resolutely anti-Communist as his contemporary but unconvinced by the Spanish nationalist claims of the insurgents and the moral force and doctrinal legitimacy of their \u2018holy war\u2019. He became increasingly doubtful during the civil war years of exile and the broader European conflict of 1939\u201345. Intensive engagement with humanitarian activity and ideas in France and Switzerland reinforced his commitment to religious and political pluralism.The essential disparities between Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes go to the heart of global Catholic fissures during the trans-war era of the 1930s and 1940s. By exploring the interplay of ideas and events as they affected political Catholics such as them\u2014and by paying close attention to chronology\u2014it is possible to see how connections between successive conflicts were a factor in the origins of Christian Democratic predominance in Western Europe after 1945. This political ascendency resulted from a blend of the Church\u2019s conservatism in the 1930s and the anti-fascist resistance of a minority of Catholics, especially in 1939\u201345. And yet, the transnational effects of Spain\u2019s war of 1936\u20139, the dictatorship resulting from it, and the emigration of the anti-Franco Catholic diaspora as it interacted with opponents of fascism elsewhere in Europe, have not been explored. They help to delineate important continuities and complexities in the fracturing of the Church between conservative nation-statists and those advocating political and social fraternalism.[CITATION-3] As well as bringing this trans-chronology into view, an examination of the key roles played by Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes in Pax Romana, the international federation of Roman Catholic university students and graduates, opens up a fundamental and neglected aspect of the transbackground to the Christian Democratic political breakthrough. The flow of people and exchange of ideas and symbols across borders during wartime energised individuals in transcending national perspectives. Through their successive leadership of Pax Romana both men travelled intellectually and politically beyond the confined spaces of their previous models of politics and religion.[CITATION-4] Pax Romana was founded in Fribourg, Switzerland, in 1921, as an international network for distributing charity, dispensing educative and cultural guidance, and funding foreign scholarships. More importantly, it provided a transnational forum where debate distilled broad trends in Catholic thought at a time when the Church had to respond to the totalitarian challenges of fascism and Communism.[CITATION-5] The organisation thus provided access to ideas through which Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes made sense of their flight from revolution in 1936 and navigated the material, spiritual and ideological battles that followed.[CITATION-6] In the aftermath of the civil war, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez became international president of Pax Romana, occupying the role during the tumultuous era until 1946. This proved instrumental in his appointment as Franco\u2019s ambassador to the Vatican in 1948\u201350 and Minister of Education in 1951, from which post he was discharged in 1956 for embarking on liberalising reform.[CITATION-7] He later became a figurehead of Christian Democratic opposition in Spain, a trajectory he traced to his border-crossing experiences of the 1940s. Contact with Rome came initially through Pax Romana and subsequently\u2014closer to power\u2014during the Holy See ambassadorship. The city constituted not only Vatican \u2018Command Central\u2019, however, but also a hub of ideas. As Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez later declared, \u2018I had lived through the Catholicism of our war, the Catholicism of \u201ccrusade\u201d and of the confessional state; in Rome, by contrast, I found myself with men who understood Catholicism in a different way \u2026 the first men of Christian Democracy\u2019, who did not condemn the civil war\u2019s exiles as Francoist state ideology required.[CITATION-8] In June 1946, Pax Romana\u2019s world congress was controversially held in Franco\u2019s Spain, thanks largely to the efforts of Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez. Following the congress he stood down and, as part of a thorough overhaul, a new Pax leadership was elected, including Ramon Sugranyes as Secretary General, a post he held until 1958.[CITATION-9] The paths of the itinerant exile and the ostensible Franco loyalist seldom intersected directly. But their parallel lives, and eventual convergence in the early 1960s as forward-thinking lay assessors at the Second Vatican Council, illustrate the contested nature of the post-war resurgence of the intellectual laity and its relation to events both past and present.[CITATION-10] The 1946 Pax Romana congress in Spain was not primarily about Vatican authority. Rather, it demonstrated the depth of the intellectual breach in the Church and was pivotal to the revival of lay influence. To the Fribourg executive of Pax in 1946, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez stood for Franco\u2019s Spain, an inconvenient symbol not only of fascism but also of a brand of Catholicism\u2014with considerable international traction\u2014which obsessed about \u2018Bolshevism\u2019 and depended for protection on state centralism and an imposed social order founded on the family as base unit for reproducing the patriarchal and homogeneous nation. Sugranyes, meanwhile, symbolised a new, forward-looking Catholicism, associated with the public rejection of fascism and adaptable to post-war demands. Two key public intellectuals to whom Sugranyes gravitated during the Spanish and European conflicts exemplified this civic pluralism as they condemned the wartime Francoists. The first was Jacques Maritain, the French neo-Thomist philosopher, who in 1937 denounced Franco\u2019s legitimating \u2018holy war\u2019 thesis as sacrilege and later served as France\u2019s ambassador to the Vatican between 1945 and 1948. The other was Father Luigi Sturzo, the founder of the Partito Popolare Italiano, who had been exiled from Fascism in 1924, and who (like Maritain) insisted that Spain\u2019s war was inescapably aconflict rather than being about redeeming Christian civilisation.[CITATION-11] Their version of the faith as a frame for lived experience derived in part from this critique of nation-statism.Maritain\u2019s philosophy of \u2018integral humanism\u2019 was fundamental. Articulated first amid Nazism\u2019s consolidation of power, it focused on the doctrine of \u2018personalism\u2019 which\u2014confronted by the opposing forces of totalitarianism and unchecked liberal individualism\u2014set out a route to a just temporal order through respect for human dignity.[CITATION-12] These ideas, backed by fellow critics of the Church, drew Catholic attention transnationally towards the potential of political pluralism.[CITATION-13] In Maritain\u2019s terms, the Spanish rebels\u2019 violent action was in effect on a continuum with Nazi extreme nation-statism, an analysis which rapidly filtered through to Sugranyes.[CITATION-14] Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez never acknowledged such a position, maintaining that the civil war had simply been a victory won by Catholics, but from the mid-1940s he began hesitantly to absorb Maritainist ideas, largely through the transnational capillaries of Pax Romana.Whereas for many Catholics globally the Spanish conflict assumed epic significance\u2014condensing centuries of the Church\u2019s embattled history\u2014for Maritain and Sturzo it illuminated fundamental problems of the faith. Repositioning the Church meant harnessing the laity\u2019s critical faculties. The impact of their proposition needs to be gauged, however, by focusing less on these pre-eminent figures than upon the intellectuals who performed the spadework of international associations dedicated to shaping potential leaders in society\u2019s new temporal order. Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes represented a wide socio-professional group which encompassed academics, teachers, journalists, lawyers, scientists, doctors, engineers and others.[CITATION-15] Viewed from the vantage point of this social body\u2014the transnational rank-and-file of Pax Romana\u2014we can see that the organisation\u2019s trans-war progressive evolution (as explored in the following sections on the 1930s and 1940s) depended on an active struggle between rivals \u2018from below\u2019. This was a political and theological struggle initiated by disputing the meaning of the war in Spain. The resulting differences overhung the painful adaptation of Pax Romana\u2014and, by extension, that of the Church\u2014to the world order ushered in by the Second World War.Throughout the 1930s, unprecedented levels of foreign travel produced a \u2018new internationalism of university youth\u2019 by which Catholics mixed warily with secular groups.[CITATION-16] The fracturing experience of Spain\u2019s war thus affected Catholic youthful activism internationally. Most of the university branches within each country\u2019s Catholic lay structures were affiliated to Pax Romana, gaining access to its international network.[CITATION-17] In the post-1917 anti-communist struggle, Pius XI bestowed special significance on the university apostolic associations, equivalent to \u2018military academies\u2019, from which it was intended \u2018a general staff\u2019 would emerge.[CITATION-18] Activists were expected by the Holy See to restrict themselves to tasks specific to the pontificate, but the injunction to keep apart from national politics was severely tested amid the polarisation of Europe in the 1930s.In Spain, following the fall of the military dictatorship in 1930, the existing political edifice of Throne and Altar appeared to be crumbling. The new mass politics was animated by a youthful generation which, on one side, mobilised to promote change as promised by the egalitarian and secular values of the Second Republic, inaugurated in 1931. On the other, secularism was actively resisted by the mobilised young who were trained by Catholic Action to defend the \u2018Christian essence of the nation\u2019 against what was portrayed as \u2018Communism\u2019, even if not all activists advocated an integrally Catholic state.[CITATION-19] The Republic\u2019s projected law of 1933 to limit the influence of religious orders, by ending their role in education, hardened Catholic rejection of the Republic, though less so in regionalist Catalonia. In common with much of the urban upper-middle classes, both Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez (the son of a mayor of Madrid during the monarchy) and Sugranyes (whose mother was of the Catalan propertied class and whose father was successor to the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed) were educated in exclusive confessional schools, the purpose of which was to produce active Christian leaders in the professions.[CITATION-20] Immersion in student associations followed for both young men, although the implications of Catholic activism in Barcelona were significantly different from Madrid. Catholics in Catalonia were constrained by the inward-looking centralism of both the Spanish state and the ecclesiastical hierarchy. As part of a community which felt culturally and linguistically beleaguered, the Catalan Church during the nationally formative late nineteenth century in the region became a relatively popular and enlightened presence; its intellectuals looked to other parts of Western Europe for a model of Catholic modernity. Cultural difference was thus accentuated by religion. Catalan culture and language were, for example, absent from Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s primary, secondary and university education in Madrid, and, he recalled, Catalan claims during the Republic were not tackled by the Church or the state as expressions of legitimate identity but as political and constitutional threats.[CITATION-21] Sugranyes had supported the Republican government in 1931 because it recognised this regionalist-national sentiment. Christian Democracy had a significant presence in Catalonia and a Catholic political party, the(UDC), had been founded in 1931 around the young lawyer Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera, in support of social reform and pluralism. Sugranyes had moved away from the conservatism of his father, who supported the Catalanist party of the upper bourgeoisie, the Lliga Regionalista, towards the UDC\u2019s civic reforming priorities. The party\u2019s leader, Carrasco, was critical of \u2018Catholics of convenience\u2019, for example, who argued against the government\u2019s 1933 law to restrict the influence of religious congregations merely because they wished the paternalist state to continue to protect their material privileges. He critiqued the law instead by asserting the rights of Catholics as fraternal citizens of the Republic. In so doing he invoked the regime\u2019s own constitutional promise to defer to the universal rights of national minorities.[CITATION-22] This position reinforced the image which Spanish integrists had of Catalan Catholics as a potentially threatening \u2018other\u2019.Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Sugranyes thus shared in the formative collective imagination of educated Catholics, while the sources of their wartime divergence were also deeply rooted. Following the Popular Front electoral victory of February 1936, the military rebellion which led to civil war was expected. It was welcomed by Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, who was convinced that the Thomist doctrine stating the right of Catholics to rebel against tyranny justified taking up arms against the laicising Republic once a legalist electoral strategy had failed. He was typical of Catholics who had never advocated a military or fascist coup but could not stomach a Church cut down to size in the interests of modernity. By 1936 Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez believed that only the army could protect the Church. He suffered no crisis of conscience in supporting the officers\u2019 coup when it came, in contrast to the deeply conflicted Sugranyes.[CITATION-23] The Vatican was broadly supportive of the rebels\u2019 \u2018holy war\u2019 even though they were aided by the Axis states. The murder of priests in the Republican wartime zone was deeply lamented and Pius XI\u2019s March 1937 encyclical against Communism () cited this religious persecution, his message avidly disseminated in the rebel zone by Acci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica and the ACNP.[CITATION-24] Yet the regional dimension of the civil war forced the attention of Catholics globally towards questions about the communion between the Church and the faithful. The Vatican fell short of giving unconditional support to the \u2018crusade\u2019, in large part because Franco\u2019s stated aim was to extirpate Basque and Catalan regionalism, despite both being Catholic, either entirely (in the first case) or significantly (in the second).[CITATION-25] The Church was thus confronted by the limits of papal authority when faced with ethno-Catholic statism in Spain which deployed violence in the name of the faith even against Catholics. In April 1938, Manuel Carrasco became the most well-known victim of Francoist brutality against Catalan Catholicism when he was captured and executed, despite Luigi Sturzo\u2019s mustering of international Catholic protest, with the help of Alfredo Mendiz\u00e1bal, the Christian Democratic Spanish lawyer, by this time exiled in Paris with Sugranyes.[CITATION-26] All Catalanists were abhorred by the military rebels, even those who favoured the Francoists once war came and mounted propaganda internationally on behalf of the generals\u2019 \u2018crusade\u2019, as the elitist Lliga Regionalista did from Geneva and Paris.[CITATION-27] Rebel hostility was particularly scornful, however, towards the forward-thinking archbishop of the Catalan diocese of Tarragona, Francesc Vidal i Barraquer, who like Sugranyes had escaped the revolution in 1936 with the help of the regional Republican government. Barraquer declined to sign the much-publicised July 1937 collective letter of the Spanish bishops supporting the rebels and his return to Tarragona after Franco\u2019s victory was blocked by the new regime. The archbishop was given refuge first in Italy and later in Fribourg, becoming a figurehead for progressive Catholic exiles there.[CITATION-28] They included Sugranyes, who from exile publicised key texts of Catalan Catholic culture as potential exemplars of a single, forward-thinking, national identity.[CITATION-29] Displaced Catalans in Switzerland nonetheless formed two mutually antagonistic networks: the larger (based on the conservative Lliga) supported the generals\u2019 rebellion for the sake of order and property; the smaller, loosely associated with the UDC, was condemned by the majority for its scepticism.[CITATION-30] Sugranyes\u2014who had been formally called upby both contending forces in Spain\u2014was refused absolution by a Catalan priest at Geneva\u2019s Basilica of Our Lady, in November 1936, because he had not returned to Spain \u2018to fight for Christ the King\u2019. His confession was taken instead by Maritain\u2019s confidant, Father Charles Journet, with whom Sugranyes was put in touch by another Catalan priest, Carles Card\u00f3, who was taught by Journet at the seminary in Fribourg.[CITATION-31] The anti-Leftism of Sugranyes\u2014and of Card\u00f3\u2014was nevertheless clear: he considered the Left Republicans in control of the Catalan government (the Generalitat) to be collaborators of the revolution because they \u2018handed power to the rabble\u2019 by agreeing to share power with anarchists after they helped resist the military rebellion of July 1936. He went so far as to discuss a possible counter-revolutionary coup of Catalan exiles against the Generalitat to forestall the region\u2019s occupation by Franco.[CITATION-32] Card\u00f3 agreed about the need to suppress the \u2018red Catalans\u2019; when Sugranyes voiced his indecision about returning either to Burgos (HQ of the rebels) or to Barcelona, his mentor advised that the latter was impossible: \u2018At the orders of Moscow, never!\u2019[CITATION-33] Sugranyes thus objected strongly to the revolution; but he also rejected \u2018the lesser evil\u2019 of fighting with a violently centralisingforce. The thought of supporting the imposition of \u2018a forced and artificial religiosity with sacred images draped in Field-Marshal\u2019s robes\u2019 was impossible.[CITATION-34] Crucially, communication with Maritain and, first, Sturzo\u2014to whom he turned for counsel, with Card\u00f3\u2019s encouragement, in early 1937\u2014led Sugranyes to a fusion of his Catalanist objection to the rebels with a broader Catholic humanist analysis.[CITATION-35] Sugranyes began to accept abstention from the conflict and talked in social Catholic terms of \u2018self-elevation\u2019 as a means to rising above the contending parties.[CITATION-36] Contact with pro-Franco Catalans had convinced him that they possessed \u2018a certain love of the White terror\u2019.[CITATION-37] From Sturzo he sought spiritual and political affirmation as well as help with finding employment, possibly in London.[CITATION-38] His vacillation over entwined religious, political and national allegiances was palpable, as were the limits of his analysis of the Republic:we Catalans have seen our country treacherously put in the hands of the worst enemies of Christian civilization: communists and anarchists. We were thus obliged to put the destinies of our country in the hands of the rebel generals as the only means of restoring order and peace.And yet reliance on the generals spelled \u2018immense dangers\u2019 because it would mean government established upon \u2018a tragic basis of hate and spitefulness\u2019.[CITATION-39] Sturzo\u2019s decisive reply, defining the war as a social conflict, offered a rational critique of the \u2018holy war\u2019 myth. As he saw it, anti-clerical workers in Spain \u2018became angry with God\u2019 because the Church had failed to back social reform. It then further mortgaged itself by siding with \u2018the crusade\u2019. Total victory of one side over the other could not bring genuine peace, he argued, nor overcome the Church\u2019s probable consequent crisis caused by dependence on an authoritarian state.[CITATION-40] Sturzo\u2019s advice reflected an emerging fraternalism, which became a framework for Sugranyes by virtue of exiled existence among fellow Catholic outsiders. At its heart was a critique of traditionalist patriarchal sanctities. The fate of Sugranyes\u2019s planned marriage exemplified, indeed, how the political and the personal converged in wartime conditions, creating possibilities for re-imagining the relationship between public and private. Betrothed to a young woman whose pro-Lliga family supported the Spanish generals, he was pressured to return and join the rebels and was accused of being a \u2018coward\u2019 and a \u2018traitor\u2019.[CITATION-41] It was his friend, Carles Eugeni Mascarenyes, with whom he had left Barcelona for Geneva in 1936, who offered a reasoned Catholic alternative. Following Maritain\u2014who in 1934 explicitly deprecated the bourgeois paternalist norm of marriage reduced to social convention\u2014Mascarenyes (from his own site of refuge in Toulouse) suggested a model of marriage as an affective coupling based on \u2018a communion of political and moral ideas\u2019. Ultimately, his friend insisted, Sugranyes was\u2014or should aspire to be\u2014\u2018a different kind of man, a humanist, if you like\u2019.[CITATION-42] The betrothal was thus ended; within two years Sugranyes met his future wife, Liselotte Bickel, an exiled German convert of Jewish background, while both were working temporarily for the League of Nations in Geneva. For Sugranyes, war sharpened the Catholic fraternalist critique of patriarchal marriage and, it should be added, of antisemitism, both in general and within the Church.[CITATION-43] Sugranyes thus justified abstention through what he perceived as the moral deficiencies of nation-statist Catholics who acquiesced in violence and totalitarianism. To Sturzo, in June 1937, he voiced his revulsion at \u2018the wave of uncivilised passions, cruelties and lusts unleashed by the (Spanish) war\u2019, condemning \u2018the political immorality, profiteers, and despoilers\u2019 who surfaced in its shadow. These opportunists were \u2018hardly less widespread (in the rebel zone) than among the so-called Reds\u2019. Among them were Catholics who cleaved to state power and relished the Church\u2019s sharing of the public sphere alongside the military rebels and falangists. The chances for Maritain\u2019s conjectured \u2018civic fraternities\u2019 were being buried by a \u2018complete lack of charity in private relationships\u2019; people had \u2018made a way of life out of denunciation (of enemies)\u2019. This was \u2018morally worse among the \u201cwhites\u201d (who belonged) to classes which claim superiority\u2019. The criticism owed something to historic Catalanist claims to supremacy in the task (still pending, as they saw it) of constructing a modern state in Spain. The real cause of the war, Sugranyes declared, was a lack of intelligence, \u2018of a cultivated and responsible elite for many decades\u2019, culminating in a war between \u2018proletarian masses\u2019 and \u2018bourgeois masses\u2019.[CITATION-44] His critique was nevertheless fired by the energising transnational experience of fraternalist Catholic theory and practice.The dialogue with Sturzo was vital as Sugranyes remained materially vulnerable, unable to obtain assistance from Pax Romana\u2019s Secretariat, to which he made a request in April 1937.[CITATION-45] At a time when the organisation\u2019s public position depended on the approval of the pro-rebel Bishop of Fribourg\u2014Pax\u2019s honorary president\u2014there was no appetite to engage actively with the Maritainist critique of Franco\u2019s war. The organisation\u2019s newspaper steered clear of the conflict, indeed, until early 1938. Collecting aid for Catholic students in Spain was all that could be done, apart from disseminating in the Catholic university press the tendentious collective letter of the Spanish bishops.[CITATION-46] Despite Pax\u2019s official quietism it was nonetheless impossible to suppress all criticism. At the World Congress in Ljubljana in 1938 one delegate ventured that the Church\u2019s social failings in Spain had created a barrier to the poor. The workers had burned churches in revolutionary Barcelona at the same time as displaying posters referencing the 1891 social teachings of Leo XIII and pronouncing: \u2018This is what Catholicism\u2014and this is what we\u2019.[CITATION-47] As Sturzo had written to Sugranyes, \u2018the Spaniard is Catholic in his own way, even when burning churches as a form of protest\u2019.[CITATION-48] This social analysis was relatively marginal, however, remaining so during much of the European war, until the opportunity arose to question fundamental assumptions at Pax\u2019s momentous 1946 congress in Spain. In 1938 Pax remained publicly conservative, heralding the student branch of Spanish Catholic Action as the engine of future Spanish regeneration, for example.[CITATION-49] By 1946, such a position was untenable.Francoist discourse during the war in Spain was the antithesis of Sturzo\u2019s social analysis. The leitmotif was collective martyrdom, based on the killing of priests and lay Catholics in the Republican war zone, especially in the conflict\u2019s early months. In recognition, the central theme of Pax\u2019s 1938 congress had been \u2018the Catholic student faced with Communism\u2019. The Primate of Spain, Isidro Gom\u00e1, wrote to the organisation\u2019s Swiss Secretary General, Father Joseph Gremaud, explaining Spaniards\u2019 inevitable absence and affirming that \u2018our martyred and blood-drenched Spain is firm proof of what Communism brings with it\u2019.[CITATION-50] When Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was elected president a year later he was thus imbued with symbolic capital as a youthful \u2018crusader\u2019 and survivor of his own personal encounter with \u2018Communism\u2019. Shortly before, he attended the assembly of the South American Catholic student body in Lima as a man of faith forged in battle \u2018who had suffered (the war\u2019s) tremendous trauma\u2019.[CITATION-51] The symbolism of sacrifice had been vindicated by the deliberate inclusion among the Spanish delegation of young men visually exhibiting combat wounds.[CITATION-52] The fraternalist counter to the martyrdom narrative depended publicly on the Comit\u00e9 pour la Paix Civile et Religieuse en Espagne, established in Paris and supplemented by Spanish and British equivalents. It relied on Sturzo and Maritain, backed by Cardinal Barraquer, Alfredo Mendiz\u00e1bal and other Catholic exiles.[CITATION-53] This committee became a vehicle for schooling Sugranyes and others in humanitarian organisation. When paid employment dried up in Geneva, he relocated to Paris where the Comit\u00e9 was based, lodging in early 1939 at the same hotel as Mendiz\u00e1bal. In April 1938, he had presented a report on the exchange of prisoners and civilian evacuation to the Committee\u2019s conference, undertaking also to establish a Swiss peace committee. Pro-Franco Swiss Catholics made this difficult and Sugranyes commented on the \u2018provincialism\u2019 of the Catholic milieu in Geneva, paralysed by its \u2018terrible fear of Communism\u2019.[CITATION-54] Ultimately, Catholic fraternalism would be boosted by the shifting balance among Catholic intellectuals as a result of Hitler\u2019s war in Europe. The laity was strengthened, at the same time, by the growing prominence of its technocratic and professional sections and their active involvement in transnational resistance to occupation and fascism.[CITATION-55] The war in Spain cast a shadow over Pax Romana during 1940\u201346 as the organisation manoeuvred intellectually between fascism and resistance. As they joined with others displaced during the European war, border-crossing exiles from Spain helped crystallise Catholic aspirations for post-war Europe. Ambitious ideas were fertilised in a specific geographic space, encompassing France, Italy and ultimately Germany\u2014with neutral Switzerland in-between\u2014from where Christian Democratic hegemony later emerged. Gremaud evoked an intellectual utopia, indeed, in his representation of exile-enriched Fribourg as \u2018a little Europe\u2019, an image he extended to the entire country as \u2018one vast university\u2019, associating Swiss neutrality with emerging fraternalist ideas.[CITATION-56] It was an impression shaped by an environment very different to that of Catholics in Spain, whose anti-Communism fed self-referentially upon triumphalist Francoism after April 1939.With the fall of Paris, Sugranyes, Mendiz\u00e1bal and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sempr\u00fan\u2014another Spanish critic of nation-statist Catholicism\u2014headed for the main centres of Spanish Republican exile, first Bordeaux, then Toulouse and L\u2019Auche, where diverse strands of anti-fascism coalesced in reaction to the heavy-handed Vichy authorities. When P\u00e9tain visited L\u2019Auche in early 1941, Republican refugees and other anti-Vichyites were \u2018rounded up\u2019 to avoid protests against the government. Card\u00f3 wrote to Sugranyes lamenting the attitude of the French Church hierarchy: the connivance of \u2018so many Constantinian dignitaries in this unintelligent, squandered world\u2019.[CITATION-57] From Franco\u2019s Spain, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez situated himself and the Spanish regime differently, aligned with leading figures of this same French hierarchy. In April 1942 he visited Montpellier to speak at the twentieth anniversary celebration of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise des \u00c9tudiants Catholiques (FFEC) beside the Archbishop of Lyons, Cardinal Gerlier, an enthusiast for P\u00e9tain\u2019s authoritarian \u2018regeneration\u2019 of France.[CITATION-58] Sugranyes meanwhile was fortunate that a job opportunity arose at Fribourg University in 1941 thanks to the support of Fathers Journet and Card\u00f3, as well as the Italian anti-fascist Gianfranco Contini, chair of Romance Philology there since 1938. Another exile in Switzerland who gave support was the socialist literary scholar Giuliano Bonfante, who had fought for the Spanish Republic.[CITATION-59] Among significant opponents of fascism who became leaders of Pax Romana within this milieu was the French mining engineer Roger Millot, a former president of the FFEC and Pax\u2019s vice-president after 1939. Alongside Millot, the internationalism of Sugranyes developed, first in Paris and later in Fribourg, and the two men were ultimately instrumental in formulating the statutes of the renovated organisation in 1946\u20137.[CITATION-60] In the pre-war years, Millot worked with the Christian Democratic reviewand with Cardinal Verdier, both critics of Action Fran\u00e7aise and active in combatting antisemitism. In these respects Millot was a disciple of Maritain and, with the fall of France, he joined the \u2018Rue de Verneuil\u2019 resistance group with like-minded Catholics.[CITATION-61] One of these was Father Michel Riquet, another Pax progressive inspired by Maritain\u2019s, which sustained him in the 1930s and later during his detention in the Nazi camps following deportation.[CITATION-62] Millot was active in the progressive Centre Universitaire Catholique, established clandestinely in 1941, becoming its vice-president in 1945.[CITATION-63] From 1944, he supported the Mouvement R\u00e9publicain Populaire (MRP) and organisations advocating reconciliation with Germany, European unity and greater lay participation to equip the Church for a reconstructive effort through flatter Catholic hierarchies.[CITATION-64] Public leadership of Pax Romana until 1946 nonetheless remained in the hands of Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez. As Pax international president and Franco propagandist\u2014funded by the Spanish state\u2014he was given a platform and was able to travel abroad. His aim was to legitimate Franco\u2019s anti-Communist regime by playing down former Axis links and diverting attention towards the new peril from the East which he believed had been responsible for Spain\u2019s tragedy. For his politicism, indeed, he would be censured by the Pax executive in early 1946.[CITATION-65] Such was the pessimism generated from Spain about the West\u2019s weakened anti-Communist resolve that a Bolivian delegate to the 1946 Pax congress was moved to react by declaring his rejection of \u2018Europe\u2019s decrepitude\u2019.[CITATION-66] The congress would in fact be divided over what the political resurgence of Western Europe really meant and what role Catholics should play.Despite the UN\u2019s condemnation of Franco\u2019s regime, the next global assembly of Pax Romana, delayed from 1940, went ahead in June 1946. Fribourg was concerned that holding it in Franco\u2019s Spain would appear \u2018in the eyes of leftists, and even among Catholics\u2019, as proof of the \u2018sympathy\u2019 of Catholics and \u2018even of the Vatican\u2019 for \u2018fascist regimes\u2019.[CITATION-67] Such accusations were \u2018false\u2019, according to the Pax executive, but it was only too aware of criticism from anti-fascists, including Catholic students exiled from the civil war, for holding the \u2018grand spectacle\u2019 in Spain:Franco, whose pagan Falange wishes to cover itself with a pious veil, always tries to hide behind the screen of a false Catholicism. But true Catholics will not let themselves be trapped. Catholic students of the entire world, who fought with the rest of the youth against the infamous regimes of Hitler and Mussolini, will not play the game of Franco, a temporary vestige of the Axis regimes.[CITATION-68] The executive\u2019s doubts about the congress were hardly mollified by the manner of its inauguration, held on Corpus Christi in the image of the Constantinian Church that Sugranyes despised. Culminating in the palace of the Cardinal primate in Toledo, the ceremony followed High Mass and a military-escorted public procession of the consecrated Host. Toledo was the medieval heart of Christian Spain, the pinnacle of a historical triangle evoking the Counter-Reformation, with congress sessions also planned at Salamanca and El Escorial.[CITATION-69] Some 500 delegates participated, half of them from Spain, supplemented by large contingents from South America and Portugal. The ethno-Catholic emphasis was reinforced by the inaugural session\u2019s focus on the Hispanic imperial legacy: spiritual and cultural unity \u2018born of a great Christian State\u2019, an autarkic form of power in the interests of national sovereignty. All attempts at \u2018exoticism imported from outside\u2019, it was argued, \u2018tended towards abolition of spiritual hierarchy\u2019.[CITATION-70] This conservative nation-statism was shared by the dozen or so \u2018ecclesiastical advisers\u2019 from Rome, several of them recently displaced from Eastern Europe. Spanish, Polish and Ukrainian delegates, thus united, declared themselves anti-Communist not only as Catholics but also \u2018as patriots\u2019 because, \u2018while Catholicism had made the existence of many nations possible, Communism aspires only to their disappearance\u2019. The function of Catholic universities in this \u2018Christian state\u2019 model was to participate in nation-building, reorientating Catholic ideas by counteracting \u2018modern intellectuals\u2019.[CITATION-71] Smaller delegations, from Britain, the USA and Italy, were more ideologically diverse, several being sympathetic to delegates representing the progressive Fribourg executive\u2014including Millot\u2014who had embraced Sugranyes and other refugees during the war.As a civil war exile and disciple of Maritain and Sturzo, there was no question of Sugranyes running the gauntlet of the congress. Maritain himself believed Pax profoundly mistaken in holding the event in Franco\u2019s Spain and would not set foot there. In protest he went further, declining an invitation later in the year to the organisation\u2019s jubilee congress in Fribourg.[CITATION-72] He was also aware that the context of Stalinist expansion appeared to favour conservative anti-Communism. Congress discussion about \u2018peoples in servitude\u2019 was indeed framed by Eastern Europe\u2019s experience rather than that of recently defeated fascist states or Spain, the only exception being a call\u2014significantly, from a Basque delegate\u2014to support future global jurisdiction for limiting state sovereignty. This view was shared by Sugranyes and the Pax executive, represented in person by the organisation\u2019s Swiss Assistant Secretary for Europe, Bernard Ducret, a convinced Maritainist whose open clash with conservatives over anti-Communist strategy became the defining moment of the event.According to traditionalists, Maritain\u2019s \u2018doctrine of the outstretched hand\u2019 was based on \u2018false optimism\u2019, failing to recognise that Communism was \u2018a form of religion\u2019 and thus incapable of evolution. It was \u2018a work of the devil\u2019, not explicable by economic exploitation, but entirely \u2018passional\u2019. Lust for material rewards and \u2018intellectualism\u2019 were its sustenance.[CITATION-73] Ruiz Gim\u00e9nez did not use such language, preferring only to remind delegates that \u2018religious liberalism\u2019 had been condemned explicitly by the Holy See. In the absence of the French, Maritainist advocacy in favour of workers and the poor came from affiliates of the Federazione Universitaria Cattolica Italiana (FUCI), who affirmed private property to be subordinate to \u2018the common good\u2019.[CITATION-74] There were practical examples of this on the ground, including the Rome-based Istituto Cattolico di Attivit\u00e0 Sociali, directed by the anti-fascist lawyer, Vittorino Veronese, a Maritain disciple who became a leader of Pax\u2019s progressive restructuring in 1947, alongside Sugranyes and Millot.[CITATION-75] When it was announced that some young FUCI affiliates intended to accompany Italian Communist students to the World Student Congress, to be held in Prague in August 1946, tensions were brought to a head, prompting a Spanish delegate to demand that Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez read aloud from the 1937 encyclical, to the effect that Communism was intrinsically perverse and could not be collaborated with under any circumstances.[CITATION-76] The counter challenge came from Ducret, the Pax executive\u2019s Assistant Secretary, in an intervention of some moment which was not printed in Madrid\u2019s published congress proceedings.[CITATION-77] Voicing the feeling of the Fribourg executive, Ducret appealed for concerted, urgent and critical action on the Church\u2019s relation to the temporal world as the post-war dawned. Merely \u2018repeating constantly that Communism is the greatest enemy of the Catholic Church and of our civilization\u2019 was to set the discussion \u2018on a false and dangerous course\u2019 and, although he had no issue with papal declarations, he determined to make a stand \u2018\u2019 against the \u2018method\u2019 employed by those assembled:We have just read a passage from. You applaud with vehemence, and you think leaving this congress, with Communism definitively condemned, that you can rest. Well, no! Communism is out there and is watching you all. It will soon be at your home, dear South American friends \u2026 Do not fall asleep. Seek instead during this congress to know why our Catholicism has been left behind by numerous doctrines, and by Communism in particular. (Seek to know) what our weaknesses were, their causes \u2026 If our elders had sought to apply pontifical teachings in the social field, instead of applauding as you have just done, we might not need today to talk of Communism \u2026 You should therefore seek here the practical means to fight in your university, in your country, and, through Pax Romana, on the international level, against all doctrines.This coda, cautioning against \u2018doctrines\u2019, was surely intended to encompass fascism, a warning against alignment with Franco\u2019s authoritarian paternalist solution.[CITATION-78] The position of the Pax executive was clear, and yet the reading fromhad received a great ovation, as did the testimonies of exiled Eastern delegates to the martyrdom of Ukraine and Poland who blamed \u2018exaggerated intellectualism\u2019 among Catholics for the diffusion of Communism.[CITATION-79] Close encounters with perceived existential threats counted in arguing for a Church defended by impregnable nation-states and against \u2018intellectualising\u2019 the mysteries of the faith. The Spanish student, it was declared, \u2018knows Communism not only because he studies the encyclicals but through our martyrs\u2019.[CITATION-80] It was easy enough to believe that Spain had \u2018saved Europe\u2019 through a martyrdom which outshone all others in the 1930s and was on a par with the current suffering of Eastern Europe.[CITATION-81] Bearing witness was contrasted with the shortcomings of Catholic nuclei (progressives), \u2018in specific countries\u2019, who \u2018undervalued Spanish blood\u2019 and \u2018denied the mystery of martyrdom\u2019; they were themselves \u2018a mystery\u2019, obscured and cosseted by intellectual elitism.[CITATION-82] In the aftermath of the congress, both sides used Pax Romana as a channel to attempt to sway the Vatican. Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez cabled Rome, reaffirming Pax\u2019s unyielding adherence and identifying international condemnation of Spain with an alleged \u2018wholesale assault\u2019 on the Church. To confirm Pax\u2019s fealty, a papal audience was arranged for Spanish and South American delegates on route to the jubilee congress in Fribourg to be held in August.[CITATION-83] During the visit, mass was held among the sepulchres of the early martyrs in the Roman catacombs, an opportunity for Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez to extol in the Spanish press the offering made by \u2018God\u2019s soldiers of Spain\u2019 in resistance to atheism.[CITATION-84] The laying of the lips of these soldier-delegates upon the tombstones of the first Christians situated religious faith symbolically where it belonged: outside of time. It was an act consistent with an ethos of the Church\u2019s separateness from the rest of social life, a position that the mentors of Sugranyes had warned against during and after the civil war because of its political implications. In papal audiences between 1939 and 1943, the exiled Catalan archbishop Barraquer had in fact decried state exploitation in Spain of religious pilgrimages, processions and enthronements to legitimise the political charisma of \u2018men of destiny\u2019.[CITATION-85] And yet, at the same moment that Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was perpetuating Spain\u2019s \u2018crusade\u2019, Ducret was airing concern to the Pax executive about the Church\u2019s relation to Spain\u2019s \u2018total state\u2019, reinforcing the point that fixation on Soviet atheism had obscured the danger of \u2018totalitarian states\u2019 whichthe Church. The Maritainist concept of personalism, a philosophical motif for Sugranyes since 1937, was at the heart of Ducret\u2019s critique of regimes which assumed that God desires order and ideological truth so much that it \u2018takes precedence over the person\u2019.[CITATION-86] Social order in a Europe being reconstructed was a natural priority, but not at the expense of liberty. Ducret\u2014guided by Sugranyes and others\u2014recognised, moreover, that Franco\u2019s rule was opposed by the clergy in regions with a strong, separate, national identity.[CITATION-87] Appropriation of the faith in the interests of a peculiarly backward-looking sort of modernity thus set Spain apart and constituted an object lesson in what Catholic modernity shouldmean:The current illusion in Spain is to believe that Christianity is a \u2018successful\u2019 religious revolution: the salvation of man by man, rather than by God (and) a very clear nostalgia for good times where the message of Christ accepted by all completely penetrated and informed society, including the state \u2026 Thus the present is lost to the rescue of a past that does not really exist. It is for us to extract ourselves from this illusion.Ducret added that \u2018every state Church is a dependent Church\u2019; history showed it had \u2018never received any temporal support which ultimately did not demonstrate its weakness\u2019.[CITATION-88] The experiences of Sugranyes tallied with this analysis and informed his reforming efforts to re-shape Pax Romana, abetted by Ducret and other former anti-fascist activists, including Millot and Veronese. Among the first steps were the devising of new organisational structures, the formation of a secretariat for relations with UNESCO and the celebration of an intensive summer school on the theme of Christian Democracy.[CITATION-89] In the summer of 1946, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez had continued to laud Franco publicly as a saviour; however, less than a year later, he felt compelled privately to express regret for \u2018errors\u2019 committed during his presidency to the newly formed Pax executive, which by this time had Ramon Sugranyes at its centre.[CITATION-90] The Fribourg congress in August 1946 became the launch pad of the organisation\u2019s reconfiguration, addressing fundamental questions over Nazism and Franco\u2019s war which had been avoided by the Church. These questions had been encapsulated by Ducret\u2019s courageous statement only weeks before at the congress in Spain. Priorities to address in 1946\u20138 included the contradictions between confessional states and the modern world, the marking out of a position on universal human rights (and consequent limits upon national sovereignty) and the role of Catholics in a potentially federalised Europe. Intellectuals\u2014and the educated laity in general, conditioned by successive conflicts since 1936\u2014led responses during this denouement of Pax\u2019s internal struggle.Participation in the effusion of ideas at war\u2019s end called for a separate intellectual Pax section, alongside the student federation, as proposed first in 1945. By early 1947, a new bipartite structure was thus established: a student body (Mouvement International des Etudiants Catholiques: MIEC) and a section for \u2018those of the intellectual professions\u2019 (Mouvement International des Intellectuels Catholiques: MIIC).[CITATION-91] Swiss reformists headed the MIEC. Andr\u00e9 Florinetti, a member of the executive which had censured Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez for politicism, became its head. The first president of the MIIC was also Swiss\u2014the chancellor of Fribourg University, Hubert Aepli\u2014and Sugranyes became the intellectual section\u2019s first general-secretary (1946\u201358). A commission was established to draw up new statutes.[CITATION-92] Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez had been superseded, but the commission included another Francoist civil war veteran and Catholic Action activist, Francisco Sintes Obrador, who now sat alongside Sugranyes (the civil war exile), with two other anti-fascist disciples of Maritain: Roger Millot and Vittorino Veronese. When Sintes proposed limiting the reach of the laity by spelling out Pax\u2019s subordination to Rome, this was overridden. When he also objected to foregrounding the Maritainist \u2018requirements of Christian humanism\u2019, the wording was diplomatically amended to \u2018Christian and human values\u2019, but the progressive meaning and purpose were beyond doubt.[CITATION-93] The imperative was to align both new branches with the emerging global order, while enabling future critical engagement with competitors\u2014\u2018associations of a materialist character\u2019\u2014as well as resistance to those openly inspired by Communism.[CITATION-94] The founding conferences of the two nascent sections were staged simultaneously in Rome at Easter 1947 and hosted by Alcide de Gasperi, by this time Christian Democratic Prime Minister of Italy.[CITATION-95] The reformulated Pax statutes received formal papal approval and a high-ranking Cardinal Protector was appointed.[CITATION-96] All of this was symbolic of incipient change. In the light of his conspicuous absence from Pax assemblies since 1937, Maritain\u2019s key address to the Rome conferences signalled Pax\u2019s change of course, as did that of his, \u00c9tienne Gilson.[CITATION-97] The moment of the laity seemed to have arrived and could not be squandered. If Catholicism failed to place itself at the centre of modern society, Gilson declared, the temporal world might anyway appropriate ideas which were fundamentally Christian.[CITATION-98] Beyond the rarefied world of the public intellectual, the broader educated laity had a vital technical and educational role in modern life, as well as exercising \u2018political duties\u2019 as citizens. These professionals possessed \u2018a vocation gifted by God\u2019\u2014educators, doctors, engineers, jurists, industrial managers\u2014to lead what was imagined confidently as a \u2018spiritual regeneration of mankind\u2019.[CITATION-99] And yet the organisation\u2019s ambiguous position between philosophical idealism\u2014theoretically challenging the established social order\u2014and the expediencies of post-war politics, had not been resolved. In 1942 Maritain had already identified the tension between \u2018a constructive peace struggling through time toward man\u2019s emancipation\u2019 and politics as power, in the interests largely of \u2018the health of the state\u2019.[CITATION-100] Once the statutes were approved, Aepli stood aside, and Millot was elected president of the MIIC, alongside his friend Sugranyes. Veronese became vice-president. Millot was in an advantageous position because, through the Pax-affiliated CCIF, he was in Paris to attend the initial meetings of UNESCO, helping establish the Vatican\u2019s UN Coordinating Committee there. The twin sections of Pax were granted UNESCO consultative status as NGOs in July 1948. Like all Catholic bodies, Pax\u2019s charitable and intellectual brief was parallel to disseminating the faith and promoting the interests of the Church. But the aims of UNESCO fitted with papal advocacy of human solidarity on an international scale and Pax aimed to contribute means by which this could be achieved: intellectual and \u2018moral\u2019 co-operation, beyond political and economic arrangements.[CITATION-101] Gilson declared that Catholic intellectual co-action would be instrumental in reining in nationalism. Sugranyes echoed this idealism, the proper aim of Pax being \u2018to organise within the entire world the fraternity of spirits that places intelligence at the service of God\u2019.[CITATION-102] Maritain himself became head of the French delegation to UNESCO\u2019s general assembly in Mexico in 1947, urging Catholics to find common ground with others promoting humane reconstruction, regardless of creed.[CITATION-103] Veronese later served on the executive committee of UNESCO (1952\u20136), before becoming its Director General in 1958. Beside him, Pax\u2019s representative in South America between 1939 and 1945, the German Rudolph Salat, became head of the agency\u2019s Department of Cultural Activities, having been attached to Konrad Adenauer\u2019s government, first as head of cultural affairs of the diplomatic service in 1949 and then at the Vatican embassy. Much of this activity happened tangentially to national politics, of course, where Maritain\u2019s ideal \u2018civic fraternities\u2019 might have been realised in concrete terms. But dissemination of personalist ideas transnationally via intellectuals associated with Pax Romana helped confirm Christian Democratic leaders\u2019 commitment to parliamentary democracy after 1945 as the only political system compatible with Christian faith.[CITATION-104] Transnational connectivity had kept a spirit of anti-fascism alive since 1939 which broadened through Pax Romana after 1945 when the need to integrate socially and religiously those who may once have been swayed by extremism was recognised. Salat, for example, was acutely aware how his accumulated experience of wartime \u2018international lay apostleship\u2019 on behalf of Pax contrasted with the majority of male Germans of his generation who \u2018know nothing of foreign countries except as soldiers of occupation\u2019.[CITATION-105] In August 1948, the Pax executive produced a commentary on the draft of what became the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Although Catholics preferred the personalist term \u2018dignity\u2019 to the vocabulary of \u2018the rights of man\u2019, Sugranyes was convinced after discussion with Father Journet\u2014his mentor and confessor since 1937\u2014that it was natural to seek a \u2018convergence in practice\u2019 of human rights and the Catholic tradition with which he felt imbued. At the same time as Maritain insisted from the embassy at the Holy See that religion must respond to change in the temporal world, Sugranyes argued similarly that \u2018Natural Law\u2019 was adaptable to the movement of history, \u2018as moral consciousness progresses and society evolves\u2019.[CITATION-106] The 1948 Pax memorandum on the Declaration had to reconcile the opinions of many federated bodies, but it was predominantly positive, welcoming the emphasis on the human person, even if it lamented lack of specific attention to the right of the family to protection by the state.[CITATION-107] As a Catalan exile from Franco\u2019s Spain, Sugranyes had little cause to argue with support for political rights or the memorandum\u2019s call for limits to state sovereignty and advocacy of federalism. To Sugranyes, as an anti-Francoist\u2014and an anti-Communist\u2014some level of \u2018supra-national juridical guarantee of political liberty\u2019 was required.[CITATION-108] It was also desirable that where \u2018the historical development of a people leads to local self-government\u2019, the state should be decentralised.[CITATION-109] Through Pax Romana, he maintained\u2014with pan-European anti-Communism as a backdrop\u2014the production and exchange of cultural values constituted the basis for \u2018the political union of Europe\u2019.[CITATION-110] When he visited South American countries as General-Secretary of the MIIC in the summer of 1949, the guiding principle\u2014in contrast to Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez in 1946\u2014was not bounded by the ethno-imperial values of.[CITATION-111] Conscience prevented him from delivering such a message. But the purpose was in any case part of something broader and more present, inescapably related to the Cold War: to foster a socio-political programme to forestall the threat of \u2018totalitarianism\u2019 while tempering the \u2018excessive individualism\u2019 of US secular liberalism.[CITATION-112] This article has investigated the circumstances which motivated transnational connectivity among Catholic intellectuals during wartime. Competing anti-Communist strategies provided the basis of the complex and fractured landscape of the intellectual laity in the 1930s and 1940s. On the one hand, patriarchal conservatism cleaved towards protective nation-states; on the other, fraternalist pluralism was oriented towards civil society and regional identities. To this relatively familiar theme of the production and dissemination of religious and political ideas across boundaries the article adds a narrative about the absorption of such ideas at an intermediate level between the educated faithful in general and the elite of exalted public thinkers in particular. Two complementary approaches have been combined: first, a trans-war chronological framework which explores connections between convulsive events (here, the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War and its aftermath); and second, a spatial corroboration of these temporal connections via the parallel biographies of two significant individuals who crossed boundaries between and within nation states. By analysing the successive periods of Pax Romana\u2019s leadership by Joaqu\u00edn Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and Ramon Sugranyes, corporate Catholic transnationalism has been balanced by an individualist \u2018molecular\u2019 focus on Catholicism as a universalist framework for lived experience as well as political commitment. The parameters of both men\u2019s responses were set by overlapping national and global Catholic communities, tangible as well as imagined. Yet their reactions were also necessarily adaptive to events in real time. Amid geopolitical calamities over which they had no control, and the dissemination of philosophical responses from public intellectuals, their previous spatially bounded perceptions and models of polities, cultures and even religion were outstripped.In 1967, when encouraged to reflect on the 1940s, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez pinpointed exchanges across borders during that decade as instrumental in his acquiring \u2018a much fuller consciousness that Spanish Catholicism was a province within world Catholicism\u2019.[CITATION-113] This was more than retrospective rationalising. His involvement with Pax Romana represented a dialogue beyond the nation-state, the Francoist \u2018National-Catholic\u2019 ideal. After 1945, the Franco government relied on a shared international Catholic identity as a means to legitimacy and survival. It is possible to interpret this as evidence of foreign acceptance of Francoism, confirming Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez simply as Franco\u2019s representative.[CITATION-114] But this ignores friction among political \u2018families\u2019 within the Spanish dictatorship and tends towards a monolithic view of the Church internationally. At the very moment of Pax Romana\u2019s 1946 congress in Spain, its figurehead, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, was being undermined, obliged to defend himself from Catholic critics close to power in Spain who believed he was clandestinely using foreign links to organise a Spanish Christian Democratic party to weaken the government.[CITATION-115] The congress had signalled the widening gulf between Spanish orthodoxy and those who aligned with post-1945 fraternalist modernisation. The Pax event in Spain had therefore only superficially represented the zenith of Francoism\u2019s relations with global Catholicism; in reality it marked a low point in the Spanish regime\u2019s international standing among Catholic intellectuals. Transnational links with Spanish Catholics subsequently recovered to a degree but only through the endeavours of Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez and others from an increasingly humanist position which drew them further away from regime orthodoxy. Spanish Catholic intellectuals became more acceptable internationally in direct relation to their cautious departure from the repressive nation-statist essence of Francoism.By 1949, if not before, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was thinking pluralistically in political and religious terms which converged with those understood by exiles, such as Ramon Sugranyes. While ambassador to the Holy See, he had corresponded with the long-banished former Republican Interior Minister, \u00c1ngel Galarza, who in revolutionary Madrid in 1936 had intervened to save his life. The context of their communication on the Spanish political situation was the early Cold War, which from Galarza\u2019s point of view called for a \u2018grand Catholic Party, profoundly oriented towards social policy and tolerance\u2019.[CITATION-116] More than a decade earlier, Sugranyes had written similarly to Luigi Sturzo during the war in Spain: \u2018only a profoundly Christian social and political action will be able, after the end of the war, to bring peace\u2019.[CITATION-117] In May 1947, in the wake of consecutive catastrophic wars, he transposed this programme to the global level in addressing the Pax Romana community: \u2018By knowing each other better, by allowing ourselves to benefit from each other\u2019s experiences, we Catholics of the liberal professions from each country will become aware of the mission that awaits us within the modern world, for which we must begin by re-appropriating the very notion of \u201cChristianity\u201d\u2019.[CITATION-118] From 1947, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez helped encourage participants from \u00adoutside Spain\u2014including Sugranyes\u2014to attend the discussion group held each summer in the Basque city of San Sebasti\u00e1n to debate Spanish alignment with Catholics internationally. These \u2018Conversaciones Cat\u00f3licas Inter\u00adnacionales\u2019 were the brainchild of the humanist mathematician Carlos Santamar\u00eda, a Maritainist who had campaigned for a Basque university in the 1930s, as Sugranyes had done for Catalonia.[CITATION-119] The progressive nature of the themes discussed\u2014close parallels to those on the agenda of the reconfigured Pax Romana\u2014was unheard of in the context of the early Franco years and provoked preoccupation in Madrid\u2019s Foreign Ministry. When Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez was made Education Minister by Franco in 1951, his attempt to liberalise the university system led to his dismissal. Non-integrist Catholics like him had been useful in government (especially foreign affairs) since 1945 but they had not been able to re-shape the Franco state in their own image. Shortly after the dismissal of Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez, notice was given by Pope John XXIII of the Second Vatican Council. Sugranyes and Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez came together among the invited lay assessors. When asked in 1958 what he most hoped would be achieved, Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez pointedly stated the most basic fundaments of post-1945 Catholic modernity, as lacking in Spain: revision of Church\u2013state relations (\u2018consonant with present historical circumstances\u2019) and greater dialogue between the ecclesiastical sphere and the secular world.[CITATION-120] During the 1960s he presided again over Pax Romana and became a leading figure of the barely tolerated intellectual opposition in Spain, bringing together Christian Democrats from Spain and the regions with social democrats.",
