      "The label \"opinionated\" is appropriate for this citation because the author expresses their opinion on the significance and importance of adopting a local focus, specifically on Béziers, to understand the mobilization of patriotic cultures in First World War France. The author argues that urban history sheds critical light on the nature and mobilization of patriotic cultures, emphasizing the role of urban civil societies in the success of national mobilization. This opinionated stance is evident in the author's evaluation of the local focus as a crucial aspect for historians of the French Third Republic to consider, challenging conventional historical narratives and methodologies.\n"
